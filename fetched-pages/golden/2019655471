Though military sources had not yet provided details, the family of Army 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman said they were told he died Monday when his helicopter went down in the volatile Diyala province northeast of Baghdad. As Heidtman's family learned of the 24-year-old's death, news was emerging from Iraq about the incident. The U.S. military on Tuesday announced the loss of a Kiowa helicopter - a small, highly maneuverable scouting and attack aircraft with two aboard. As a ground rescue team raced toward the scene, its vehicles were hit by roadside bombs, killing six more soldiers. Two other soldiers were killed Monday by a roadside bomb in south Baghdad, the military reported. The 116 deaths reported by i-casualities.org, a website that compiles statistics about the war in Iraq, makes this month among the worst of the war. The site also gives the latest total count of U.S. fatalities at 3,468. Heidtman's family and friends struggled Tuesday with the news that they had lost a son, brother, baseball player and college graduate. The family issued a statement, saying they were devastated by the loss but "proud of his service to his country." "We support what he wanted to do," said his stepfather, Arthur Robidoux. They also wanted to say they were glad for the support already pouring in. Their day was hectic, Robidoux said - "mentally and physically trying." Keith Heidtman, the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux, graduated six years ago from the Norwich Free Academy. Hugh "Duke" Campbell, a principal there, was his assistant baseball coach. "It's tragic news for all of us," Campbell said. Campbell knew Heidtman since he was a boy coming to baseball camps and remembers him as the hard-working first baseman and outfielder who hit .371 one year. On Tuesday, he sat looking at a letter of recommendation he had written for the pending grad in 2000, when Heidtman was applying to the University of Connecticut. It opened: "Keith Heidtman represents everything that is right about young people today. He brings the whole package to the table every day." Heidtman graduated two years ago from UConn with honors. His education also included ROTC - the four-year training program to become a military officer. "He showed up in my office one day," said Maj. Glenn Colby, enrollment officer there. "He wanted to serve his country," Colby said. "You couldn't ask for a better kid." Last year, Heidtman had another graduation - from an Army aviation school in Alabama. And then, six months ago, he was in Iraq. As Memorial Day approached, Task Force Lightning was working northeast of Baghdad in one of Iraq's more unsettled regions. The commander of U.S. forces there, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, said earlier this month that Diyala province's government is nonfunctional and that he would need additional forces in Diyala "to get that situation to a more acceptable level." Seventeen days later, on Monday, eight of his soldiers were killed in this single incident. A spokesman with the Connecticut National Guard, which is usually assigned to assist Connecticut families like Heidtman's in the casualty process, said his office isn't allowed to talk about such casualties in the first 24 hours after the family is notified. But as she has so many times, Gov. M. Jodi Rell on Tuesday ordered that the state's flags fly at half-staff until the burial. From the Multi-National Force Iraq, a brief notice: "Two Task Force Lightning soldiers were killed when a helicopter went down in Diyala province May 28. The incident is under investigation." Heidtman isn't the first former student of Norwich Free Academy killed in Iraq. That was Spec. Jacob D. Martir, shot in Sadr City in 2004. Nor was he the first ROTC graduate from UConn to fall. Capt. Jason Hamill was killed in Iraq just a few weeks before Heidtman got there. Contact Jesse Hamilton at jhamilton@courant.com. Interact with The Courant: Reader Rep.

Lewis "Scooter" Libby. Libby, who was convicted in March of perjury and obstruction in the CIA leak case, had asked that the letters not be released. Attorneys for several news organizations argued that the law required the letters be made public. U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton agreed, citing a need for transparency. "The court has received more than 150 sentencing letters in this case, some urging leniency for the defendant and some expressing opprobrium at the defendant's actions and calling for the imposition of a substantial prison sentence," Walton wrote. The letters will be released after Libby is sentenced June 5, Walton said. Addresses and other personal information will not be released. Libby was convicted of lying about his conversations with reporters about former CIA officer Valerie Plame, whose secret position was revealed in a 2003 newspaper column. Libby was not the source for that story but a jury found that he made several false statements to leak investigators and obstructed the investigation. Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has asked that Libby receive up to three years in prison. Libby is expected to ask for no jail time. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Zoellick "is deeply devoted to the mission of the World Bank," Bush said in a brief announcement Wednesday. "He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty, to grow their economies and offer their people the hope of a better life." If approved by the World Bank board as expected, Zoellick would take over a mammoth institution grappling to redefine itself in the wake of the ethics scandal that led to Wolfowitz's resignation after a bitter battle that lasted months. The board said in a statement late Tuesday that it would accept nominations from any board member, not just the United States, and hoped to make a final decision by June 30, when Wolfowitz officially steps down. The United States controls about 16% of the board's voting power. By tradition, the U.S. president names the president of the bank, while the Europeans have controlled the leadership of its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund. However, the appointment in 2005 of Wolfowitz, one of the architects of the U.S. war in Iraq, led many in the developing world and in Europe to question whether the tradition ought to be abandoned. "We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to focus on the future together," Zoellick said in his remarks at the White House. Zoellick promised to listen carefully to the bank's staff, donors and borrowers. By all accounts, Zoellick, 53, is well regarded in the tight world of global finance, winning the backing of key European finance ministers. He served as U.S. trade representative in Bush's first term, helping to launch the World Trade Organization's latest round of trade talks. He then moved to the State Department, serving as Condoleezza Rice's top deputy. He's been a managing director at Goldman Sachs for the past year. Praise for Zoellick flowed in from official Washington. "Bob has the skills and the integrity to put the bank back on the right path," said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "The institution's membership should expect a leader dedicated to reducing poverty and intolerant of corruption and kleptocracy," said Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., the minority whip in the House. "The president should have been selected on merit, not nationality," said Elizabeth Stuart, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam International, in a statement. However, Zoellick could prove himself the right person for the job if he turns the bank's priorities upside down to focus on helping the poor, rather than on pleasing donors or bureaucrats. "We are disappointed," said Sameer Dossani, director of the 50 Years is Enough Network. "He's another white, male, neoconservative." Dossani said Zoellick had carried the water for U.S. corporations, especially the pharmaceutical industry, in trade negotiations. "He doesn't have any development experience, and he doesn't have the respect of many people." Rex Nutting is Washington bureau chief of MarketWatch.

The former U.S. trade representative will take over a 61- year-old agency that has expanded its mandate beyond building roads and clinics to include goals such as promoting ecological tourism and funding theater groups. Zoellick is more likely to concentrate on objectives that bring tangible results. ``The bank has to focus its mission on poverty reduction,&#39;&#39; said John Taylor, undersecretary of Treasury for international affairs from 2001 to 2005 and now a professor of economics at Stanford University in Stanford, California. ``Bob&#39;s management experience will enable him to implement those measurable-results reforms very well.&#39;&#39; Zoellick, 53, who negotiated seven international trade agreements in President George W. Bush&#39;s first term, is also apt to emphasize the economic benefits of giving developing countries unfettered access to overseas markets. ``He deeply believes in free trade,&#39;&#39; said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Before he can alter the bank&#39;s mission, Zoellick will have to win the trust of 13,000 staffers demoralized by two years of conflicts with departing President Paul Wolfowitz, who resigned this month over his role in giving his companion a pay increase. Bank employees said the controversy had damaged the credibility of an institution that preaches good government. Managers and board members clashed with the former U.S. deputy defense secretary over his appointments of recruits from the Bush administration, the bank&#39;s role in Iraq and his anti- corruption agenda. ``Having to clean up the Wolfowitz mess is going to detract from any effort at reform for at least a year or two,&#39;&#39; said Desmond Lachman, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a former official at the International Monetary Fund. Zoellick, nominated by Bush yesterday, told reporters in Washington he will consult member countries about ``the role of the bank.&#39;&#39; He said he had spoken to former presidents James Wolfensohn and Robert McNamara. ``One of the biggest challenges, if not the biggest challenge, will be the leadership and management issues that the bank faces today,&#39;&#39; he said. ``This institution has been through a traumatic period.&#39;&#39; Wolfowitz yesterday told Charlie Rose that he acted in good faith in dealing with his companion. ``I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a bad manager,&#39;&#39; Wolfowitz said, adding that because of the controversy, ``we&#39;d gotten to the point where it was not possible to be effective.&#39;&#39; Zoellick&#39;s nomination is subject to approval by the bank&#39;s board, which has said it would make a decision by June 30, when Wolfowitz leaves. The U.S. nominee has always won approval under an arrangement that reserves leadership of the IMF for a European. Zoellick became deputy secretary of state at the start of Bush&#39;s second term and left government in June of last year to become a vice chairman at New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. He&#39;s on a long list of Goldman executives to join or rejoin the top ranks of government. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is a former Goldman chairman, and his former co-CEO Jon Corzine was elected senator from New Jersey and then governor. Joshua Bolton, Bush&#39;s chief of staff, was an executive director at Goldman in the 1990s. As trade representative in Bush&#39;s first term, Zoellick managed commercial relations with China and started the so- called Doha round of global talks. At the State Department, he traveled to Sudan to broker a peace agreement between the government and a rebel group. ``Zoellick is as good as it gets based on his record of promoting trade and combining policy vision with actual implementation of policies,&#39;&#39; said Ian Vasquez, director of the Project on Global Economic Liberty at the Washington-based Cato Institute. His diplomatic experience may help him continue Wolfowitz&#39;s fight against corruption. Wolfowitz ruffled feathers at the bank by suspending aid to countries including Kenya and Bangladesh without the board&#39;s approval. ``What Wolfowitz did was rub people&#39;s noses in it,&#39;&#39; said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ``He kind of marched up that mountain and now Zoellick has an easier task of keeping it going.&#39;&#39; Zoellick will also face criticism that the bank shouldn&#39;t lend to middle-income nations such as India and China, which can raise money in capital markets. Lending to such countries accounted for more than half of the $23 billion in World Bank aid last year. Zoellick yesterday ticked off a range of ills afflicting poor nations, including discrimination against women, corruption and environmental degradation. He didn&#39;t specify which ones the bank should tackle. ``Zoellick&#39;s really got a huge challenge ahead of him,&#39;&#39; said William Easterly, a former World Bank economist and a co- director of New York University&#39;s Development Research Institute. ``What the bank needs to do is find a few things it&#39;s good at doing and specialize in them.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporters on this story: William McQuillen in Washington at ; Matthew Benjamin in Washington at Last Updated: EDT Related Media on Demand Wolfowitz Says He Didn&#39;t Want to Set Companion&#39;s Pay Wachovia to Buy A.G.

Ruling Wednesday, Judge Maurice J. Gallipoli rejected West New York's argument that parade organizers were essentially running "a charitable fraud" that claimed to use the parade to raise money for scholarships and other charities but was actually a for-profit enterprise. Parade organizers and others had claimed the permit for Sunday's parade was denied for political reasons. They implied that Mayor Silverio Vega, who is running for state Senate in next Tuesday's primary, didn't want to march alongside another suburban mayor seeking the same seat. "It's been a tremendous ordeal through a mayor who was a little messed up in the head," parade founder Emilio Del Valle said after the ruling. Vega did not respond to a telephone message seeking comment. He previously said he would lie down in front of the marchers to keep them out. An attorney for Del Valle contended that Vega's decision to deny the permit amounted to a curtailment of First Amendment rights because it didn't reflect "any governmental purpose or concern" such as crowd control or safety.

For Matthew Evans, it was cause for joy. "My favorite word!" said the 12-year-old boy from Albuquerque, N.M. The 80th Scripps National Spelling Bee began by reducing the record field of 286 spellers to 59 on Wednesday. Those who survived will return for the semifinals and finals Thursday, and the champion will be crowned on prime-time national television. Most of the winnowing was done with a 25-word multiple-choice test, followed by three oral rounds that featured a display of confidence, nervousness and befuddlement &mdash; not to mention sheer relief when a guess proved correct. "Yes!" exclaimed 12-year-old Tia Thomas of Coarsegold, Calif., who pumped her fists and skipped back to her seat after correctly spelling "periostracum" (the hard covering of a mollusk shell). "I was pretty sure I knew the word," Tia said. "But the 'peri' part was guessing." Matthew and Tia, both in the national bee for the fourth time, are two of the favorites to become the champion. The winner receives $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. Achieving that goal will require outlasting 13-year-old Samir Patel of Colleyville, Texas, who is back for the fifth year after placing third, 27th, second and 14th. With his grandfather from India &mdash; visiting the United States for the first time &mdash; sitting on the front row, Samir breezed through "decor" in the preliminary round, and "trumpery" (of low quality) and "sunglo" (a green Chinese tea) in the quarterfinals. "I'm a lot more prepared than I was the first year," Samir said. "I'm not as nervous, and I already know sort of the routine, so I'm not so much worried about 'Am I going to be there on time?' 'Am I going to make a mistake in walking down the stage?'" Far removed from the glamour of the rounds that will be televised on ESPN and ABC on Thursday, the bee started early in the morning in a setting that more closely resembled a classroom of students taking the SAT. Spellers from English-speaking parts of the world filled in ovals with their No. 2 pencils during the multiple-choice test, which included words ranging from "icicle" to "ylem" (a hypothetical substance from the early universe). Matthew was happily surprised when he saw that the 25th word was Bewusstseinslage (a state of consciousness, pronounced bay-VOOHST-sines-lahg-eh), which he likes "just because it's so weird-sounding." "I was like, 'Oh my goodness. Wow! This is awesome,'" said Matthew, who got 24 of 25 correct. Then all of the spellers were given their only guaranteed moment on the Grand Hyatt's ballroom stage: a chance to spell one word before the audience of parents, friends and judges. "Macaroni &mdash; what does it mean?" asked 14-year-old Michael Yeh of Kokomo, Ind., exercising his right to ask for a definition before correctly spelling the popular food. The multiple choice test (worth 25 points) and the preliminary oral round (worth three points) narrowed the field to 107. Thirteen more were eliminated in the next round, and 35 heard the telltale bell signaling an incorrect response in the day's final round. Every year there are spellers who have their own quirks to help them stay focused. This year, some wrote letters in the air, others on their hands. Jonathan Horton, 14, of Gilbert, Ariz., who finished in a tie for sixth last year, has developed a rhythm in which he turns his head and appears to feign a cough several times while spelling a word. He did it four times while working through the 10 letters of "exhilarate." "I say a couple of letters into my hand, and then I say them out loud," said Jonathan, who also advanced to the semifinals. "I do that because I don't want to say the wrong letter out loud." Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kan., made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever by correctly spelling "enumerated" in the preliminaries, but she was stumped by "coadunation" (union of a large body) in the quarterfinals. Kennyi Aouad, 11, of Terre Haute, Ind., became a crowd favorite after he couldn't stop laughing when he was given the funky-sounding word "Sardoodledom" (a melodramatic plot). He finally composed himself and asked all sorts of questions about the word &mdash; definition, part of speech, alternate pronunciations, use in a sentence &mdash; then tried to get an unallowable hint by asking: "Is it kind of like kingdom?" He could hardly believe it when he spelled the word correctly.

http://www.connpost.com/localnews/ci_6015830&cid The Connecticut Post Online - Attackers kill 10, kidnap 5 in Iraq Top Business News (AP) Top News Headlines (AP) Attackers kill 10, kidnap 5 in Iraq RAVI NESSMAN Associated Press Article Last Updated: 05/29/2007 10:49:16 PM EDT BAGHDAD &#8212; Ten American soldiers, one with Connecticut ties, died in roadside bombings and a helicopter crash on Memorial Day, the military reported Tuesday, making May the deadliest month of the year for U.S. troops in Iraq. The helicopter crash claimed the life of a Norwich soldier, the governor's office said Tuesday. Army 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman, 24, was the 37th military member with Connecticut ties to die since the war began in 2002. Two Connecticut civilians have also been killed. Gov. M. Jodi Rell ordered all state and U.S. flags lowered to half-staff in Heidtman's honor. "Lt. Heidtman made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, and he did so to protect the freedom that we so often take for granted," Rell said in a statement. "To have given his life on Memorial Day is especially poignant." Heidtman was one of 10 U.S. soldiers who died in roadside bombings and the helicopter crash on Monday, the military reported. The American deaths raised the number of U.S. forces killed this month to at least 113, according to an Associated Press count assembled from U.S. military statements. Eight of the soldiers were from Task Force Lightning &#8212; six killed when explosions hit near their vehicles and two in a helicopter crash. The military did not say if the helicopter was shot down or had mechanical problems. Heidtman was a 2001 graduate of Norwich Free Academy and a graduate of the University of Connecticut. His parents were notified Tuesday morning. He was the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux. His stepfather is Art Robidoux. A phone message from the Associated Press was left at his family's home. "If you had to pick your son, this is who you would pick. He was handsome, he was bright," Kerry Heidtman told The Day of New London. Heidtman arrived in Iraq in December and was scheduled to come home for leave in July. "We're sending our finest, and we're losing them," Kerry Heidtman said. In other violence, five Britons were kidnapped Tuesday from an Iraqi government office in Baghdad, driven away in a 19-vehicle convoy filled with men in police uniforms who headed toward a Shiite stronghold in the capital, the British government and an Iraqi official said. The military said two Multi-National Division-Baghdad Soldiers were killed the same day when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb in southern Baghdad. The deaths were announced in three statements issued by the U.S. military public affairs office at Camp Victory at Baghdad Airport. Maj. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf, the Interior Ministry spokesman, said the abduction at the Iraqi Finance Ministry office was carried out by men wearing police uniforms who showed up in 19 four-wheel drive vehicles of the type used by police. He said the band of kidnappers drove off toward Sadr City, the Shiite Mahdi Army stronghold in northeastern Baghdad. In London, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said the five people kidnapped Tuesday were British. The spokeswoman gave the information on condition of anonymity in line with government policy. A senior official in the Iraqi Interior Ministry confirmed the five were British, and that Mahdi Army militiamen were believed responsible. The official provided the information on condition that his name not be used. In McLean, Va., Steve Lunceford, a spokesman for the BearingPoint management consulting firm, said one of the kidnap victims worked for the company. The other four were employees with the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld, according to Joe Gavaghan, a spokesman for the Canadian company.

Bush's Texas ranch, says she is quitting and going home because she is as disgusted with the U.S. president's Democratic foes as with his Republican supporters. "This is my resignation letter as the 'face' of the American antiwar movement," she said in a letter posted Monday on a liberal website, dailykos.com. Cindy Sheehan, an American anti-war activist and the mother of a U.S. soldier who was killed in Iraq, stands on Parliament Hill after a news conference in Ottawa in May 2006. Monday was Memorial Day, the U.S. holiday commemorating members of the armed forces killed in war. Sheehan set up camp near the ranch after her son Casey, 24, was killed in an ambush in BaghdadÂ in 2004. She was "the darling of the so-called left as long as I limited my protests to George Bush and the Republican Party," she wrote. "Of course, I was slandered and libeled by the right as a 'tool' of the Democratic Party." But when she broke with the Democrats over their reluctance to cut off war funding, she found herself under fire from Democrat bloggers, she said. The U.S. troops in Iraq "have been abandoned there indefinitely by their cowardly leaders who move them around like pawns on a chessboard," she lamented, saying she would return to California to rebuild her life. "I am going to take whatever I have left and go home. I am going to go home and be a mother to my surviving children and try to regain some of what I have lost." She added: "I have been called every despicable name that small minds can think of and have had my life threatened many times. "The most devastating conclusion that I reached this morning, however, was that Casey did indeed die for nothing. "His precious lifeblood drained out in a country far away from his family who loves him, killed by his own country which is beholden to and run by a war machine that even controls what we think. "I have tried ever since he died to make his sacrifice meaningful. Casey died for a country which cares more about who will be the next American Idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while Democrats and Republicans play politics with human lives."

This Week in Weddings Wedding of the Week Planning Ideas & Advice Perry appeals to Legislature to finish their work after walkout AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Governor Rick Perry appealed to state lawmakers today "to rise above their differences and finish the work of the people of Texas." His appeal came after a walkout by opponents of state House Speaker Tom Craddick walked out of the House in the pre-dawn hours today. That denied the chamber of a quorum and brought its work to a halt. The walkout was started by El Paso Representative Pat Haggerty. He is part of a group who claims Craddick has bent the rules in his favor to keep others from taking his seat as speaker. "This man is sitting here violating every rule of the house, every rule of parliamentary procedure to keep himself in office and it&#39;s wrong," stated Haggerty. Perry said the rupture in the House has "placed in serious jeopardy legislation that has statewide impact." He specified legislation addressing state water, border security, clean air,parks funding and energy policy. Another bill awaiting House action calls for mandatory random steroid tests for every high school athlete in the state. A rush of legislation is expected today as the Texas House and Senate hurry to get as much done as possible before the Legislature adjourns at midnight (Central time). Thirty-two bills are left on the schedule. Democratic state Representative Joaquin Castro and others who participated in the walkout say they could vote to suspend the rules to take up the legislation when they meet this afternoon.

As Council members took turns speaking on the issue, crowds booed, hissed and cheered, and the meeting was called to order several times. Adding to the drama, Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who is white, was chastised by Councilman Charles Barron, a Brooklyn Democrat and a former Black Panther, for her opposition to the measure. The Council voted down the measure 25-15, with seven abstentions. Staten Island's three-member contingent rejected the Carson street renaming. The tally broke down largely along racial lines, with only one vote to rename the street coming from a white member and all black members either voting for the renaming or abstaining. "This fairly innocuous bill, a street renaming ... sounds so innocuous, so routine, and yet now it's not that," said Councilman Albert Vann, a black Democrat from Bedford-Stuyvesant who spearheaded the measure. "You've hit a nerve. You're harking back to a time that we've already overcome. You're infringing upon our human right." Ms. Quinn, a Democrat, called Carson "divisive" in explaining her "no" vote. "If you look at the life and the full record of who Sonny Carson was, it was divisive. It is a record that is without apology. It is not a record which stood in full support and full solidarity for all New Yorkers of all races and religions," Ms. Quinn said, while the crowd fired jeers of "You didn't know him!" Carson, a Korean War veteran who died in 2002, led protests against police brutality, among other things. He was criticized for calling himself "anti-white," a quote Barron said was taken out of context by the media. Carson was arrested in 1974 on charges of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping -- prosecutors claimed he had ordered the revenge shootings of two men -- and convicted of kidnapping. Sentenced to seven years in prison, he served 15 months and became politically active following his release. Ms. Quinn, who is openly gay and is regarded as having liberal views, was on the end of a harangue by Barron and other black Council members. "You brought us to a place of divide that this City Council has never experienced," Barron said, often pointing a finger at her during his speech and refusing to stop when his two-minute time allotment ended.

That's a laugh | www.azstarnet.com Â® Make us your home page Thu, now, it's free! Buy Daily Star photo reprints Kennyi Aouad, 11, sees the funny side of things as he tries to spell "sardoodledom" â and succeeds. Jacquelyn Martin / the associated press Arizona's Jonathan Horton, 14, of Gilbert, who finished in a tie for sixth last year, advanced to the semifinals. Bert's Electric & Plumbing High School Dance Teacher 59 spellers dodge the deadly ding; 'sardoodledom'? That's a laugh Scripps Howard News Service Tucson, Arizona | Published: 05.31.2007 WASHINGTON â Humor and the horror of the fatal ding punctuated the Scripps National Spelling Bee's first day of competition here Wednesday. When the words settled, 59 out of 286 spellers were left standing. The battle continues this morning, with the semifinals on ESPN from 7 to 10 a.m. Tucson time. ABC will broadcast the finals at 7 p.m. in Tucson. This year marks the first time for metal detectors at the bee's site in a downtown Washington, D.C., hotel. Guards inspected all bags and stood ready to more closely examine anyone or anything setting off the detectors. Bee director Paige Kimble said the measures are "proactive, not reactive." Officials felt it was time to match security to the event's rising profile. The Wednesday afternoon quarterfinals brought a new enemy: the ding of a bell, the kind that could be sitting on any hotel counter. If the contestant got a word wrong, it was o-v-e-r, signaled by a ding. After that sound, a bee crew member shook the defeated speller's hand and led him off the stage. His next stop was the "comfort room," also known as the crying room, where the speller could come to terms with his loss in private. Expected to end by 5:30 p.m., the quarterfinals kept going until 6:20. Kimble said creating a bee schedule is a "guessing game." By the last 90 minutes, empty chairs had gone from a rarity to a trend onstage as the ever-more-difficult words decimated the ranks of the spellers. The contestants fidgeted in their chairs and played with their placards before falling into a line three deep behind the microphone. Shelley Clark's pigtails looked as if they were sagging while she struggled with "acuminate." The 13-year-old home-schooled student from Tigard, Ore., got the definition from the judge: "Tapering to a slender point. Pointed." "Is that from the Latin 'ad,' meaning towards?" she asked, dismissing any notion her brain was as tired as her pigtails. After acing the word, she was suddenly bursting with energy as she bounced back to her chair. Luck is a big factor in winning, and Lady Luck wasn't exactly smiling on Kennyi Aouad. That didn't stop him from grinning and outright cracking up. The 11-year-old sixth-grader at Otter Creek Middle School in Indiana was waiting at the microphone when the judge calmly lobbed "Sardoodledom" at him. A grin as bright as his red shirt immediately broke out on his face, and he started guffawing. The audience cracked up, too. "Sardoodledom?" Kennyi said, still chuckling. "Sardoodledom," the judge confirmed. "Sardoodle â ," Kennyi's giggles interrupted his efforts to repeat the word. He recovered and asked for the definition. "It's another word for melodrama," the judge said, in part. Kennyi's face turned solemn, and he asked for the language of origin. "It's from a French name," the judge said. The speller's lips moved silently. "Umm. Umm," he said. "Is it like kingdom?" Kennyi asked the judge. Then he took down the word, conquering it one letter at a time while the crowd listened in amazement. The boy dashed back to his seat, his arms raised in celebration. And, indeed, the crowd went wild. 0 Comments on this story $1 Sunday delivery - Subscribe to the Arizona Daily Star Letter to the editor â¢ sign up now U of A basketball coverage

(Paul Buckowski / Times Union) Identity of crash victim sought State soccer championships in Wilton Women's press group honors Bellevue CEO Model plane collectors take hobby to new heights Path to citizenship can be a test of patience, wallet $275 fee increase, new questions for naturalization exam leading to complaints Click byline for more stories by writer. First published: Thursday, -- While President Bush and Congress clash over federal immigration policy, there's good news and bad news on taking the test to become a U.S. citizen. New questions being finalized this summer appear to be easier, for some, than the old test questions. The citizenship test was last changed in 1986. On the downside, it will cost substantially more to take the test: $675, up from $400. The hike takes effect July 30 as part of substantial across-the-board increases in fees for immigration services ranging from green cards ($195 to $370) to permanent resident status ($325 to $1,010). There's a rising chorus of complaints over the fee hikes. "The fee increases put too much of a burden on the backs of the working poor," said Tom Shea, a staff attorney with the New York Immigration Coalition. While the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services receives about 5 million immigration form applications annually, a political battle continues to rage in Washington over what to do with the country's estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, after six years of tinkering, new test questions are being finalized on what amounts to the final hurdle before naturalization. About 84 percent passed the old citizenship test on the first try according to a 2004 survey. About 95 percent passed a pilot test with new questions on the first try in a 10-city trial over the past six months. Albany was one of the test cities and the passage rate locally was slightly higher than the national average, according to Shawn Saucier, a bureau spokesman. "I got 10 out of 10 right and thought the new questions were really easy compared to the old test questions I had studied," said Charlene Amanda Knight, who took the test at the bureau's Latham office May 5. The person giving the citizenship test selects 10 questions out of a new pool of 100 that will be put in place next year. Passing the test requires answering six out of 10 questions correctly. A test taker gets two chances to pass the test. After that, the immigrant must reapply and pay the $675 fee again. There is no limit on how many times the test can be taken. In a typical year, the bureau receives about 1 million applications for citizenship and naturalizes about 700,000 people. In the Latham office, about 1,200 people are naturalized each year. Knight, 26, of Albany, works as an administrative assistant in the state Health Department. She held Jamaican citizenship but grew up mostly in the U.S. and was granted American citizenship Friday in a ceremony in Troy. Her parents, who live in Florida, had become citizens years earlier, but Knight's paperwork was lost in the immigration bureaucracy. "I kept putting off taking the test because I worried about studying for it and having to pay the fee," said Knight. "Mostly, I really wanted to be able to vote because I got tired of watching the news on Election Night without voting," Knight said. Warren Roberts, a distinguished professor of history at the University at Albany, found some of the new citizenship test questions unduly difficult. 50% off Times Union home delivery.

Letters to the Editor As Lake O level falls, so does business Lake O 'waiting for the rain' OKEECHOBEE &#151; Bubba Helton wonders how long he can keep his doors open. Larry Wright would love to take someone fishing. Wendy Woodman figures it's going to be a slow Fourth of July holiday. Lake Okeechobee tied a record low water level Wednesday &#151; 8.97 feet above sea level. But the water level isn't the only thing hitting bottom in this part of Central Florida. Businesses around the northern rim of the nation's second- largest freshwater lake also are seeing record lows. Retail sales, dinners served at area restaurants, motel/campsite bookings and rentals are well off the mark following a slower than average season &#151; January through April. And the summer slowdown might spell the end for some businesses. Helton blames a large portion of his lost business on mismanaged water and mis-modeled weather forecasting. "The Army Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water Management District don't know how to run the business they're in," said Helton, owner of Garrard's Bait and Tackle on 441 in Okeechobee. "For 18 months they dumped water out of the lake, and then we went into a natural drought." The low water levels have prevented anglers from taking fishing trips on Florida's most famed fishing lake. Although the fishing is good for bass and bluegill, almost no one can get out onto the lake since the waters have receded to the point where boat ramps empty onto dry ground. Helton said he knows of three tackle shops around the lake that already have closed their doors because of waning customer traffic, and he might not be that far behind if business doesn't pick up soon. Wright, a captain who has guided anglers to lunker largemouth bass for 26 years, hopes he can continue to make a living despite what he estimates as a 75 percent drop in charters. "In May last year, I worked 26 days," said Wright, 55. "This year, I had 10." He had 21 trips last June, but has only three on the books this year. Wright said few customers are coming from other states to fish because of the low water. "We get quite a few anglers from South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama who come here to fish this time of year," he said. "The moms and dads will get their high school kids fishing trips. They're just not coming. "They may think the lake is just completely dried up." Woodman, general manager of the K.O.A. Campground in Okeechobee, said the Memorial Day weekend wasn't too bad for bookings; however, Fourth of July reservations are off quite a bit. "Our business is impacted a little bit," Woodman said, "but we have guests who come here for activities besides fishing and boating." The way Helton sees it, the entire economy of Okeechobee is tied directly or indirectly to the level of the lake. "This doesn't only affect me," Helton said. "Motels, gas stations, grocery stores, even Wal-Mart has slower sales when the traffic is down." And Helton's unhappiness doesn't end with the water managers. "We've been let down by our county commissioners, congressmen, senators and governor," Helton said. "I don't care if there's a three-legged dog running in the next election, I'm voting against all of them." 3 (bookings to date) 41 bass, 48 bluegill and shellcracker 31 bass to 8 pounds Forecasters with the National Weather Service predict a roughly 40 percent chance of rain on Friday and a 50 percent chance of rain on Saturday. The South Florida Water Management District says even if it does rain, it would have to fall directly over the lake to help it rebound. Bubba Helton wonders how long he can keep his doors open.

Ties Record for Its Lowest Water Level; Lake Bed Burns Amid Drought Deep cracks cover the bottom of what should be five-feet deep Lake Okeechobe near Okeechobee, Fla. Tuesday as the drought continues statewide in Florida. Lake Okeechobee, a backup drinking water source for millions in South Florida and the lifeblood of the Everglades, is nearing a record low at 9.6 feet, four feet below average. &#40;J. Pat Carter/AP Photo&#41; By JENNIFER KAY Associated Press Writer MIAMI May 30, 2007 (AP) Water levels in dried-out Lake Okeechobee matched a historic low Wednesday while firefighters battled a blaze burning on part of the exposed lake bottom. The South Florida Water Management District expected the record of 8.97 feet from May 24, 2001, to evaporate by Thursday as the region's worst known drought continues. The average water level should be around 13 feet this time of year in the second-largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. The 12,000-acre fire started Monday in the vegetation left to dry in the sun as waters receded from the lake's northwest rim, said Melissa Yunas, a spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Forestry. "All the water is not there. Now it's just vegetation, all dried out, just sitting on the side of the lake," Yunas said. The cause of the fire was unknown. It was about 50 percent contained, Yunas said. Lake Okeechobee is a backup drinking water source for millions of people in South Florida and the lifeblood of the Everglades. The region is largely dependent on the lake during dry periods, when it can be used as a reservoir. "The Everglades are also in a drought. We've totally lost the backup for the water supply for the east coast" of Florida, said Carol Wehle, executive director of the water management district. An above-average rainy season is needed to replenish the lake and South Florida's groundwater system, officials said. Only about 7-8 inches of rain have fallen on the region in the past five months, about half of normal totals. No significant rainfall was expected over the lake or the Kissimmee River valley to its north before Thursday night, according to the National Weather Service. The drought has forced stringent water restrictions on homes and businesses in 13 counties, and four coastal wells were closed to prevent saltwater contamination. The drought has allowed officials to begin clearing 500,000 cubic yards of rotted plant life and sediment from the southwest portion of the 730-square-mile lake to return its bottom to a more sandy base, improve water quality and restore wildlife habitat.

Of those, five would grow into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher with winds over 110 mph (177 kph), the team founded by forecast pioneer William Gray said in its revised forecast. The updated forecast issued on Thursday was unchanged from the team's April 3 forecast for the six-month storm season that starts on Friday. The researchers said there was a 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane would hit the U.S. coastline in 2007, with a 50 percent chance that would happen on the U.S. Atlantic Coast and a 49 percent chance on the Gulf of Mexico coast. An average season brings 11 tropical storms, with six reaching hurricane wind speed of 74 mph (119 kph) and two growing into major hurricanes. Other private and government weather researchers have also predicted a more active season than average. But so far none have forecast anything like a repeat of record-breaking 2005, when 28 tropical storms spawned 15 hurricanes, including Katrina which flooded New Orleans and parts of the Gulf coast. news is provided by INSTANT VIEW-Reaction to Bush on climate change FACTBOX-Security developments in Iraq, May 31 May toll for U.S. soldiers in Iraq climbs to 122 Israel, militants exchange limited fire in Gaza FACTBOX-Five facts about hurricanes Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision Lauds Bush Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA Catholic Relief Services urges Congress to preserve US long-term development food aid initiatives that fight chronic hunger Source: CRS - USA Red Cross Awards Charity for Relief Donations!

http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7007504139&cid AHN | Guantanamo Bay Prisoner Dies In Apparent Suicide | news for the digital world Guantanamo Bay Prisoner Dies In Apparent Suicide a.m. EST Mary K. Brunskill - AHN Staff Writer San Juan, Puerto Rico (AHN) - A Saudi Arabian inmate at Guantanamo Bay prison was found dead in an apparent suicide Wednesday, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a statement. The military did not identify the prisoner's name or exactly how he died. "The detainee was found unresponsive and not breathing in his cell by guards," the statement read. Critics of the prison camp said suicides are not surprising considering Guantanamo's treatment of its prisoners. Detainees at the camp are not able to access U.S. civilian courts and spend up to 22 hours a day isolated in their cells. AP quotes Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, as saying, "You have five and a half years of desperation there with no legal way out. Sadly, it leads to people taking their own lives." On June 10, 2006, three Guantanamo prisoners hanged themselves with bed sheets. Since then authorities at the camp have tried to avoid suicides by taking sheets away during the daytime and preventing access to light fixtures. Copyright © AHN Media Corp - All rights reserved.

Arguing that Libby deserves jail time, Fitzgerald says Plame was a covert agent. May 29, 2007 - In new court filings, special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald has finally resolved one of the most disputed issues at the core of the long-running CIA leak controversy: Valerie Plame Wilson, he asserts, was a âcovertâ CIA officer who repeatedly traveled overseas using a âcover identityâ in order to disguise her relationship with the agency. Fitzgerald cites Wilsonâs covert status as part of his argumentâadvanced in two strongly worded memos filed in recent daysâthat I. Lewis (Scooter) Libby, Vice President Dick Cheneyâs former chief of staff, should be sentenced to up to three years in prison. Libby was convicted last March of four counts of obstruction of justice, false statements and perjury relating to what he knew, and with whom he shared information, about Valerie Plame Wilson in the weeks prior to her outing by columnist Robert Novak in a July 14, 2003, newspaper column. Libby, who is appealing the verdict, is due to be sentenced next Tuesday by U.S. Judge Reggie Waltonâan event that could well reignite a fierce political controversy over whether President Bush should pardon the former Cheney aide. Libbyâs lawyers, and many conservative partisans of his cause, have argued that Libby should be spared prison in part because there was no underlying crime in the disclosure of Valerie Wilsonâs identity. (As his trial established, Wilsonâs identity was leaked to a number of reporters by several Bush administration officials who were interested in discrediting the attacks by her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson, on the White Houseâs handling of Iraq pre-war intelligence.)

Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry, identified Abdul Rahman Maadha al-Amry as the man who was found dead in his cell Wednesday at the detention facility. Although the U.S. military has identified the cause of death as "apparent suicide," Al-Turki said that it was too early to judge how al-Amry died. A Saudi human rights society confirmed al-Amry&#039;s identity Thursday and blamed the U.S. for his death. "The U.S. administration is responsible for the recent death of the Saudi national that followed previous similar deaths that took place in the same prison," the Saudi National Society for Human Rights said in a statement. Today in Africa &#038; Middle East Jihadist groups fill a Palestinian power vacuum UN Security Council approves Hariri tribunal Sunni-Kurdish conflict worsens Iraqi disarray The group, which was founded three years ago to defend human rights in the kingdom, called for "an independent and neutral investigation on the circumstances of the death of Abdul Rahman Maadha al-Amry in the Guantanamo detention center." The society also called for "the release of all detainees, who spent five years in the prison without legal evidence and for an immediate closure of the detention camp which has become, because of the continued physical and psychological torture, a mark of shame on the forehead of humanity." "Leaving the detainees in prison for more than five years without trial or release is a flagrant violation of human rights principles," it said. A lawyer for several Saudi detainees in Guantanamo expressed skepticism Thursday about the U.S. military&#039;s claim that al-Amry&#039;s death was a suicide. "At the time, we announce our reservation to the American story and our doubts about its credibility," said Katib al-Shammary in a statement. "We call on the American authorities to quickly unveil the reason behind the death of Abdul Rahman Maadha al-Amry." "We stress on the necessity of carrying out an independent investigation by international and human rights organizations to determine the reasons behind the death of al-Amry and the two other detainees, Mani and al-Zahrani," al-Shammary said. The lawyer was referring to Mani Shaman Turki al-Habardi and Yassar Talal al-Zahrani who apparently committed suicide in the Guantanamo Bay prison in June. He said U.S. authorities have not yet answered questions from a Saudi medical committee about the deaths of the two Saudis.

The 64-year-old, who joins a crowded field of Republican contenders, told newspaper USA Today about his campaign plans, ending months of speculation. He is already well known for his role as a district attorney in TV series Law & Order, and has been polling well. Mr Thompson is expected to launch a "testing the waters" committee in the next few days to start fundraising. The former two-term senator for Tennessee has already been hiring staff, making speeches and setting up a strong internet presence. Reports began circulating on Wednesday that he had decided to make official his informal but already attention-grabbing initiatives towards running for president. "I can't remember exactly the point I said, 'I'm going to do this'," Mr Thompson told USA Today in an interview published on Thursday. "But when I did, that thing that occurred to me: 'I'm going to tell people that I'm thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it'." Mr Thompson has already been attracting attention with speeches He told the paper that his late start to campaigning carried "certain advantages", not least that his use of the internet "has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime". Observers say he could pose a threat to all three of the main contenders for the Republican nomination, Senator John McCain, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Some polls have put him at second or third place among potential Republican voters struggling to decide who to back in a field of almost a dozen candidates. He has strong conservative credentials on issues such as gun control and abortion and, while he voted in 2002 to authorise the Iraq invasion, he is not as closely associated with the war as some of his rivals. His charisma and ability to perform for the crowds are expected to stand him in good stead on the campaign trail. Inevitably, parallels have been drawn between Mr Thompson and another actor-turned-politician, Ronald Reagan. The actor has asked to leave Law & Order, where he has played the astute, fatherly New York District Attorney Arthur Branch for the past five seasons, in order to concentrate on politics. He is also known to viewers for roles in the films The Hunt for Red October, in which he played a US Navy admiral, Last Best Chance and In the Line of Fire.

Victoria Cavaliere reports from VOA's New York bureau. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit Wednesday in a federal court in California. The suit accuses Jeppesen Dataplan, a subsidiary of the giant Boeing Corporation, of knowingly providing the CIA with flight plans and travel logistics in order to shuttle terror suspects to foreign prisons for interrogation. The practice, known as "extraordinary rendition," has been widely criticized by human rights groups for leaving terror suspects in the hands of countries that alledgedly torture them. The CIA is not named in the suit. The ACLU's lawsuit centers on what it claims is the rendering and mistreatment of three men. The first, Binyam Mohamed, is an Ethiopian citizen who was imprisoned in Morrocco in 2002 and is now held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and also sent to Morrocco. The third client, Ahmed Agiza, is an Egyptian citizen, allegedly picked-up in Sweden, and sent back to Egypt, where he was jailed and tortured. Anthony Romero, the executive director of the ACLU, says Jeppesen knowingly and willingly participated in the renditions. "American corporations should not be profiting from a CIA rendition program that is unlawful and contrary to core American values," said Anthony Romero. "Corporations that choose to participate in such activity can and should be held legally accountable." Jeppesen provides flight plans and support services, such as crews, to pilots and airline companies. A spokesman for Jeppesen told VOA the company has thousands of customers, and does not always know why their services have been contracted. The ACLU says it was referred to the three defendants in the suit through their foreign attorneys. Ben Weisner, a lawyer with the ACLU,says all three are still incarcerated, and none have been charged. "If the United States government had any actual evidence rather than innuendo that any of these men were involved in terrorism, they should have flown them to the United States and put them on trial, rather than send them to countries where they knew they would face torture," said Ben Weisner. Washington has acknowledged the secret transfer of suspects to third countries but denies torturing them or handing them over to countries that do. The United States says it does not condone the use of torture. Also Wednesday, the ACLU announced it is petitioning the Supreme Court to review the case of Khaled El-Masri, a German citizen who says he was kidnapped by the CIA in Macedonia in 2003, then flown to a secret jail in Afghanistan, where he was allegedly tortured by his U.S. captors. His lawyers say he was released when the CIA realized it had the wrong man. Al-Masri sued the CIA, but the case was dismissed after the U.S. government invoked the "state secrets privilege," a defense that maintains a trial would jeopardize national security.

Reputed Ku Klux Klansman James Ford Seale is charged with kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1964 abduction and slaying of two black teenagers in southwest Mississippi. Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee were beaten and dumped, still alive, into the Mississippi River. Seale, now 71, faces potentially damaging testimony from Charles Marcus Edwards, another reputed Klansman charged with him 43 years ago, before the state dropped its investigation. Prosecutors say Edwards has been granted immunity, and his cooperation is believed to be crucial to the revival of the investigation. This is the latest of more than a dozen civil rights-era cases that have been prosecuted across the South since the early 1990s. Seale arrived at the courthouse Wednesday wearing an orange jail jumpsuit. Before entering the courtroom, his shackles were removed and he put on khaki pants and a light blue dress shirt. He sat quietly in court, listening through wishbone-shaped earphones to amplify the sound because of hearing problems. When he left the courthouse later, his jail jumpsuit was topped by a bullet-resistant vest. The first day of jury selection brought a Faulknerian cast of characters that reflect Mississippi's rural roots and modern anxieties. Among the 21 people dismissed from the initial group of 76 potential jurors were a one-armed chicken grower who said he needs to tend to his poultry to pay his bills, a young woman in a Confederate flag T-shirt whose daddy injured his back when he fell off a roof and a farmer who has to care for his cows every day - especially now that it's birthing season and one of the calves arrived headfirst last week. Some people said they were battling alcohol or severe anxiety. One who remained in the jury pool said he's helping rebuild Gulf Coast parks damaged 21 months ago by Hurricane Katrina. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate is keeping jurors' names a secret at the request of prosecutors who said some might fear to serve in a case involving the Klan. One potential juror from rural southwest Mississippi cried as she listed a litany of hardships - her husband works on an offshore oil rig, there's no one else to care for their young daughter while he's gone. The woman said she has hardly been able to sleep since she received her jury summons and she's too scared to drive in Jackson's traffic. About the Real Cities Network About the McClatchy Company

Saves you money. Makes you smarter. The News Tribune, Tacoma, WA - Thursday, May 31st, 2007 1:24 AM BLOG: The Prep Blog Wall Street Journal Sunday Letters to the editor BLOG: Inside the Editorial Page Nation & World Photos Bars & night life BLOG: Bring the Noise With the Strykers in Iraq Inside the Editorial Page Online in the South Sound Riding Around the Sound Open House: Real estate Today's full text obituaries Place an In Memoriam Three more from Fort Lewis die MICHAEL GILBERT; The News Tribune Published: May 31st, 2007 01:00 AM Three more Fort Lewis soldiers have been killed in Iraq, the Department of Defense announced Wednesday. They were identified as: &#8226; Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif. &#8226; Pfc. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami. &#8226; Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho. McFall and Cedeno Sanchez were killed in Baghdad on Monday, Memorial Day, when a bomb exploded nearby as they patrolled on foot, according to a Pentagon news release. Hester was killed two days earlier when a bomb detonated near his vehicle. The deaths bring to 19 the number of soldiers the post has lost in Iraq this month, more than in any other month since the invasion in March 2003. The May casualty total is now more than double Fort Lewis&#8217; previous worst month since the invasion: December 2004, when nine soldiers were killed. Fort Lewis has 10,000 soldiers in Iraq &#8211; likewise more than at any time in the war. Nearly all are deployed in two Stryker brigades in Baghdad and in Diyala province just to the northeast of the capital, scene of some of the deadliest insurgent attacks the past two months. Hester was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, which is part of the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division &#8211; a Stryker brigade that&#8217;s been in Iraq since last June. It&#8217;s expected to remain there into October. McFall and Cedeno Sanchez were assigned to the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, a part of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. It left Fort Lewis in April and arrived in Iraq early this month. The brigade has lost nine soldiers now in the first month of what is expected to be a 15-month deployment. Twenty-eight soldiers from the 3rd Brigade have been killed in nearly a year. McFall&#8217;s wife, Emily, in a statement through the post public affairs office, described her husband as &#8220;a proud dad, a great son and a friend to many.&#8221; He was renowned for his barbecued ribs and his fondness for classic rock and cold beer, she said. They had soldiers over often, especially at the holidays. &#8220;He would go into a bar, bathroom, store, anywhere, and someone would start talking to him like they knew him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He could always put a positive spin on anything. He made me and a lot of other people better just by knowing him. &#8220;He loved the brotherhood, and his heart beat red, white, and blue,&#8221; Emily McFall said. &#8220;There was only one exit for him.&#8221; A post spokesman said McFall joined the Army in 1994 and was assigned to Fort Bragg, N.C. He then spent a year in South Korea and was at Fort Lewis in the late 1990s before going to Hawaii and deploying to Afghanistan for a year in 2004-05. Cedeno Sanchez joined the Army in November 2005 and arrived at Fort Lewis the following June. Hester enlisted in May 2004 and arrived at Fort Lewis that September and deployed with the 3rd Brigade last June. Hester and Cedeno Sanchez were serving on their first combat tours. Two other soldiers suffered minor injuries in the attack that killed Hester, but they returned to duty, officials said. No memorial ceremony at Fort Lewis has been set for the three Stryker soldiers. Brig. Gen. William Troy, the acting post commander, last week wrote a memo saying that memorials now would be consolidated once a month, so presumably these three men will be memorialized together in late June.

Peace will only come when one or the other side is totally wiped out or one side totally fears the fighting capacity of the other and will cease resistance.

"We have expanded the scope of our investigation to include allegations regarding improper political or other considerations in hiring decisions within the Department of Justice," Inspector General Glenn Fine and H. Marshall Jarrett, head of the Office of Professional Responsibility, wrote in letters to the House and Senate Judiciary committees. The widening inquiry is likely to pose an additional challenge for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who is already facing lawmakers' calls for his resignation and a potential no-confidence vote by the Senate. While the U.S. attorney dismissals have prompted wide political criticism, improper hiring practices could be deemed a violation of the law. Justice officials had previously disclosed that the internal investigation would include hiring decisions made by Monica Goodling, a former Gonzales aide who confirmed last week in Senate testimony that she "crossed the line" in considering political affiliation when hiring career prosecutors and immigration judges. Federal law and department rules bar taking such affiliations into account in hiring career personnel, the Justice Department has said. Wednesday's letter revealed that the internal inquiry will examine the hiring practices of Justice officials besides Goodling and outside the attorney general's office. The expansion comes in the wake of claims by former Justice officials that selections by the Attorney General's Honors Program and the department's Summer Law Intern Program were rigged in favor of candidates with connections to conservative or Republican groups. In response, the department this spring agreed to place them back under the control of career officials. The programs were overseen last year by Michael Elston, chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty, and both Elston and McNulty approved the recent reforms. The inquiry will also look at hiring practices within the Civil Rights Division, which has seen the departure of dozens of career lawyers. The career personnel repeatedly clashed with Bush administration political appointees, who overruled them on pivotal voting-rights cases in Georgia and Texas. One former senior official in the Civil Rights Division, Bradley Schlozman, replaced one of the fired U.S. attorneys &#8212; Todd Graves of Kansas City, Mo. &#8212; and attracted controversy by indicting four workers involved in a voter-registration drive sponsored by a liberal group days before the November elections. A Gonzales spokesman declined to comment on the broadening of the probe. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate panel, said in a statement that it reinforces "the need for meaningful congressional oversight of this Justice Department and the Bush administration."

Jim Tracy, the county's highest-ranking Republican, said Wednesday night he welcomes signs that former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson is about to enter the presidential fray. Thompson, whose possible candidacy has been a topic of speculation for months, revealed plans this week to form an exploratory committee, the first step towards a presidential campaign. He has also announced that he is leaving his role on the TV drama "Law & Order." "I've known Fred pretty much all my life," said Tracy. "I think he'll make a great candidate, and I think folks from all parts of the political spectrum can support Fred." Tracy praised Thompson as "very intelligent, a good communicator ... a strong leader." Tracy said he agrees with Thompson on most issues. "He'll gain a lot of support," said Tracy, who represents Bedford, Moore and part of Rutherford counties in the General Assembly. Thompson, 64, is thought to appeal to conservatives unhappy with the three GOP front-runners, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and John McCain. Thompson will make his first formal campaign move in the coming days, establishing an official organization to weigh a White House bid while launching a major fundraising drive on Monday, according to several Republicans with knowledge of his plans. Speaking on condition of anonymity because the timeline is not public, these officials said Thompson may visit early primary states in late June and could officially enter the race as early as the first week in July. "Senator Thompson is still seriously considering getting into the presidential contest and he is doing everything he has to do to make that final decision," said Mark Corallo, a Thompson spokesman. "Stay tuned." On Thompson's schedule in the coming weeks: a speech to Virginia Republicans in Richmond on Saturday and an appearance on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" on June 12. One official said an overseas trip also may be in the works. For months, Thompson has openly flirted with a candidacy as a Tennessee-based effort sought to draft him into the race. He made several high-profile moves that pointed to a bid, not the least of which was disclosing that he is in remission after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a form of cancer. His popularity in national polls spiked to double digits early in the year, but while he still fares well in surveys, his numbers have fallen following what some Republicans considered a subpar speech in early May in California. Thompson was elected to the Senate in 1994, defeating then-Shelbyville resident Jim Cooper for the open seat which had once belonged to Vice President Al Gore. During his Senate tenure, which ended in 2002, Thompson was considered a reliably conservative vote. He worked to limit the role of the federal government and backed a ban on a late-term abortion procedure. He voted in favor of Bush's tax cuts, oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, eliminating money for the National Endowment for the Arts and a constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration. And, he voted against requiring criminal background checks for purchases at gun shows. But he sometimes took paths that didn't necessarily sit well with conservatives, including advocating for campaign finance reform. While he voted to oust President Clinton from office, he also was one of 10 Republican senators who voted against one of the two impeachment charges. Social issues, important to the party's right, also typically weren't at the top of his agenda. He was known less as a legislator and more as an investigator, leading the committee that examined former President Clinton's fundraising in 1996. Yet, he established a reputation as a less-than-hard worker. The Democratic National Committee issued a research document Wednesday detailing Thompson's major legislative accomplishments. Save for the title and a DNC disclaimer, it was blank. Thompson was one of the few senators who backed underdog McCain in 2000 over George W. Bush, the establishment candidate. This time around, Thompson would be opposing McCain -- and could hurt his friend's own shot at the White House. The two have similar Senate records but Thompson could be seen as a fresher face to McCain, who is well-known to GOP voters. Romney, who is trying to position himself to the right of the major candidates, also could see his support fall among conservatives concerned about his shifts on issues. Campaigning in Iowa, Romney said he welcomed a Thompson entry. "I think he'll make the race more interesting. He's got good ideas and after all, he does put bad people in jail every week on 'Law & Order,"' he said. Giuliani could be hindered as well if Thompson grabs the attention of Republicans uneasy with the former New York City mayor's support for gay and abortion rights. Over the next few days, Thompson plans to form a "testing the waters" committee called "Friends of Fred Thompson," which will allow him to begin raising money, hire staff and gauge support without officially committing to a White House bid. He could significantly dampen the fundraising ability of his potential GOP rivals during the homestretch of the second quarter financial reporting period. "It's going to cause everybody to have second thoughts about writing a check," said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who is unaligned in the race. Thompson spoke on a conference call Wednesday to several dozen people who officials called "First Day Founders" and said committed to raising money for him. Participants said they were asked to raise $46,000 apiece, the $2,300 maximum from 10 couples or 20 people. Officials cautioned that Thompson has made no final decision.
http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/67542.html&cid Hike in immigration fees announced Hike in immigration fees announced Wed, 30 May 2007 09:12:00GMT US World News | The US federal agency in charge of immigration visas has announced a hike in immigration application fees starting July 30. The rise will mean that immigrants will have to pay almost double the fee to get the citizenship of the country or three times the current fee to become a permanent resident. On an average, the new fees will see an increase of almost 66 percent, which the immigration agency is necessary to allow it to function. "The reason we're raising the fees, short answer, is that we need the money. A lot of people are going to be affected by this, there's no sugarcoating it", said Emilio T. Gonzales, director of Citizenship and Immigration Services. Gonzales said that with the system devised by the Congress, which wants immigrants to pay most of the money required for the processing of citizenship, means that almost 99 percent of agency's budget is supported by immigrant fees. However this is falling short of the needs of the overloaded agency. According to the new fees, the cost of getting a green card has increased from $325 to $930, while acquiring citizenship papers will cost $675, up from $330. Bringing a foreign fiance or fiancee would be paying $455 instead of the current fee of $170. Gonzales revealed that the hike in fees will allow the agency to rope in an extra 1,500 immigration officers as well as allow the opening 39 new facilities, whose main aim will be to process green cards or citizenship applications in a maximum time limit of just six months. However leaders of immigration advocacy groups are unhappy with the hike in immigration fees and say that the payment might be beyond the reach of low-income Hispanic families. "This is a fundamentally flawed system of financing our immigration services. It places an unfair burden on folks who want to become citizens and participate in all the nation has to offer", said William Ramos, director of Washington's National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund.

After nearly two years as one of the most prominent members of the American antiwar movement, activist Cindy Sheehan announced the end of her protests Monday, on Memorial Day. , published on the progressive blog , Ms. Sheehan, whose son Casey died in Iraq on April 4, 2004, lamented that her work for peace had been in vain. "I have invested everything I have into trying to bring peace with justice to a country that wants neither. ... The most devastating conclusion that I reached this morning, however, was that Casey did indeed die for nothing. ... Casey died for a country which cares more about who will be the next American Idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while Democrats and Republicans play politics with human lives. It is so painful to me to know that I bought into this system for so many years and Casey paid the price for that allegiance. I failed my boy and that hurts the most. ... This is my resignation letter as the "face" of the American anti-war movement. This is not my "Checkers" moment, because I will never give up trying to help people in the world who are harmed by the empire of the good old US of A, but I am finished working in, or outside of this system." Among the reasons for her retirement, Ms. Sheehan wrote that her efforts had drained her finances, ended her 29-year marriage, strained her relationship with her three remaining children, and took a serious toll on her health that left her with substantial debt from medical expenses. Congress's decision to continue financing the war without a definite date for troop withdrawal also played a major role in her decision. Sheehan first captured public attention when she set up a camp outside President George Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas, for 26 days starting in August 2005 . She demanded that the president tell her why her son had died in Iraq. From there she traveled the world demonstrating against American involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. The New York Times helped to give new depth to the average American's wartime sacrifices and spur the antiwar movement. Ms. Sheehan walked through Crawford that summer carrying pictures of her son as a toddler and in his Army fatigues, humanizing the war dead, who had remained in many ways invisible to large segments of the American public. Her intransigence in the face of Secret Service agents and senior Bush administration officials who tried to mollify her was a crucial element in what at the time was a small and incipient antiwar movement. Although these early efforts helped the antiwar movement grow from grass roots to mainstream, Sheehan quickly became a controversial figure. Her outspoken nature and attacks that transcended party lines caused many antiwar activists to view her as a liability. Consequently, the reports that despite her contributions, the antiwar movement will not struggle without Sheehan Anti-war leaders praised her bravery in putting a human face on the war's toll, but said the movement will not be derailed by her departure. Analysts said Sheehan has become an increasingly polarizing figure since staging her impromptu "Camp Casey" in Crawford, Texas, in August 2005, especially after she appeared with Bush-bashing Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez and announced that she would not pay federal income taxes to support the war. "She did a tremendous thing in that she took her personal loss and made it public, so that people could understand the cost of the war," said Nita Chaudhary, an anti-Iraq-war organizer for MoveOn.org. Sheehan had criticized MoveOn in March for not doing enough to oppose the war. "The anti-war movement is now the person next door, it's not just Cindy Sheehan," Chaudhary said. The resignation has pleased a number of Sheehan's critics, many of whom accused her of exploiting her son's death and profaning his memory. spoke with one of her opponents who believes the antiwar movement to better serve their needs. Kristinn Taylor, spokesman for FreeRepublic.com, which has held pro-troop rallies and counter-protests of anti-war demonstrations, said dwindling crowds at Sheehan's Crawford protests since her initial vigil may have led to her decision. But he also said he hopes she will now be able to heal. "Her politics have hurt a lot of people, including the troops and their families, but most of us who support the war on terror understand she is hurt very deeply," Taylor said Tuesday. "Those she got involved with in the anti-war movement realize it was to their benefit to keep her in that stage of anger." Despite Sheehan's exit from the antiwar movement, she does not appear to be departing from the public stage. On Tuesday she appeared on The Ed Schultz Show , a progressive radio program, and said that she plans to redirect her efforts to greater humanitarian causes In an interview with , Sheehan's sister spoke about Cindy Sheehan's sister, DeDe Miller, told CNN that the group would continue working for humanitarian causes, but drop its involvement in the anti-war movement. As for her sister's letter, Miller said, "She cried for quite a bit after writing it."

"American corporations should not be profiting from a CIA rendition program that is unlawful and contrary to core American values," said Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, seen here in December 2006. A leading US civil liberties group filed a lawsuit against a subsidiary of aircraft manufacturer Boeing on Wednesday, alleging involvement in the CIA's secret transfer of terrorist suspects. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the case against Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc., on behalf of three alleged targets of the US Central Intelligence Agency's controversial "extraordinary rendition" program. The lawsuit charges that Jeppesen knowingly provided flight services to the CIA that enabled the transportation of Ethiopian Binyam Mohamed, Italian Abou Elkassim Britel and Egyptian Ahmed Agiza to secret locations. Once in the secret overseas locations, the three were subjected to torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, the group alleges. "American corporations should not be profiting from a CIA rendition program that is unlawful and contrary to core American values," said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. "Corporations that choose to participate in such activity can and should be held legally accountable," he added. The complaint alleges that Jeppesen was one of the main providers of logistical support services for aircraft used by the CIA. The program allegedly involved US agents abducting terrorist suspects and moving them to secret locations around the world where they were routinely tortured or otherwise abused. According to the lawsuit, Jeppesen provided logistical support such as itinerary, route, weather, and fuel planning for 70 such flights since 2001. "Jeppesen's services have been crucial to the functioning of the government's extraordinary rendition program," said Steven Watt, one of the American Civil Liberties Union's attorneys. "Without the participation of companies like Jeppesen, the program could not have gotten off the ground," he said. The lawsuit was filed under the Alien Tort Statute, a law permitting aliens to bring claims in the United States for violations of other countries' laws or US treaties.

Sheehan, whose son Casey died fighting in Iraq in 2004, became an anti-war icon when she camped outside President George W. Bushâs ranch in Crawford, Texas, in 2005. Since then, she has travelled across the country, imploring the government to end the occupation in Iraq. Her announcement came in the form of a blog posting Monday on the Daily Kos, a popular liberal blog. Sheehan wrote in the blog entry that she had sacrificed her 29-year marriage, strained relationships with her remaining children and accumulated countless hospital bills during her effort to end the American occupation in Iraq, a cause for which she said she now believes her son died in vain. âThe most devastating conclusion that I reached this morning, however, was that Casey did indeed die for nothing,â Sheehan wrote. While Sheehanâs primary grievance was with the American handling of the occupation in Iraq, her often outspoken attacks were not targeted solely at the Republican party. She drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans who often criticized her actions as a ploy to draw attention. âThe first conclusion is that I was the darling of the so-called left as long as I limited my protests to George Bush and the Republican party,â Sheehan wrote in the blog entry. âHowever, when I started to hold the Democratic party to the same standards that I held the Republican party, support for my cause began to erode and the âleftâ started labeling me with the same slurs that the right used.â Sheehanâs decision to abandon her role in the anti-war movement comes after Congress passed a bill that would continue funding for the war last week. âI think Sheehan was talking about a part of the peace movement that had faith in the Democrats,â said Zanne Joi, a Berkeley resident who is an activist with Code Pink, a womenâs peace organization. âThe Democrats had the responsibility to deny (the president) that money and they had a mandate from the people to deny him that money.â Joi said Sheehanâs decision is a loss to the anti-war cause, but that the peace movement will likely continue until the troops return from Iraq. âIt is a loss but it provides an opportunity for other people to step forward and occupy that vacuum,â Joi said. Sheehan wrote in the blog entry that she hopes to mend the relationships she has damaged and regain what she has lost back at home. âIâve been wondering why Iâm killing myself and wondering why the Democrats caved in to George Bush,â Sheehan told The Associated Press Tuesday. âIâm going home for a while to try and be normal.â Contact Vincent Quan at vquan@dailycal.org.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/6-3&fd=R&url=http://cooperator.com/articles/1287/1/The-Mighty-Quinn/Page1.html&cid=1116778683&ei=muxeRqKEDZGoqwPX6vjNDQ A Look at the New City Council Speaker Remove from 'Articles to Read' Add to 'Articles to Read' Considering that she&#8217;s still a few months away from turning 40, Christine Quinn, Speaker of the New York City Council, has achieved a great deal in politics and is thought of as the second most powerful figure in city government, after the mayor himself. Quinn, a Democrat, first entered the council in 1999, and battled Brooklyn Councilman Bill de Blasio for the speaker seat. Quinn was elected speaker in January of this year by a wide margin, replacing former speaker Gifford Miller. Quinn, the first woman and first openly gay councilperson to be elected speaker, joked about the enormity if the position on the day she took office. &#8220;It&#8217;s completely daunting and overwhelming to the verge of nausea,&#8221; Quinn joked on that day to the media. &#8220;But that&#8217;s OK, because it should be. It&#8217;s that big of a job.&#8221; The Road to Speaker Christine Quinn was born into a typical Irish family in Glen Cove, Long Island. Her father was an electrical engineer and a shop steward for Local 44 of the International Union of Electrical Workers. Her late mother was a social worker for Catholic Charities. Quinn has often said that growing up in her house, political discussions were commonplace around the dinner table, and serving and helping people were family priorities. Growing up, Quinn was always interested in learning about government. &#8220;The only thing I was ever interested in was politics,&#8221; Quinn told the Daily News this past January. &#8220;I would go to the library and always take out biographies on political people.&#8221; Quinn attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut and graduated with a degree in urban studies and education. She began work as an activist directly out of college, and began leaving her mark on citywide housing issues as head of the Housing Justice Campaign for the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Development. Before being elected to the City Council, Quinn served for five years as chief of staff to Councilman Thomas K. Duane, who became the first out gay and HIV-positive person elected to the City Council in 1991. She began as his housing organizer, then campaign manager and when Duane was elected to the state Senate in 1998, Quinn won a special election the following February to succeed him. She was just 33 at the time. As a councilperson, Quinn represented the 3rd Council District, which encompasses Chelsea (where Quinn currently lives with her partner Kim), the West Village, Clinton/Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, and parts of Soho and Murray Hill. She also served as chairwoman of the council&#8217;s Health Committee, where she helped fight for important legislation &#8212; including the passage of the Equal Benefits Bill, which provides health care benefits to domestic partners and grocery workers. With an eye to developing her political career, Quinn also made sure to vary her interests. She served on the council&#8217;s committees for Finance, General Welfare, Governmental Operations, Land Use, Lower Manhattan Redevelopment, Rules, Privileges & Elections, as well as the Zoning & Franchises subcommittee. Quinn has said that before she went to work as Councilman Duane&#8217;s chief of staff, she often felt that elected officials&#8212;who get just one vote on issues&#8212;were less powerful than grassroots community organizers who can affect many legislative votes. After working in Duane&#8217;s office however, she had to reassess that view. &#8220;When you become chair of a committee, you see how when you move up the ladder you get more influence and impact than you would think from just the title,&#8221; she said at her inaugural press conference. &#8220;That swayed me in this direction.&#8221; Quinn also served as executive director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, and it was largely because of her involvement with that organization that then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani appointed her to become part of the New York City Police/Community Relations Task Force. The differences between Quinn and current Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg are significant&#8212;though perhaps less so than the rift between the mayor and former Council Speaker Gifford Miller&#8212;but both have pledged to work together for the improvement of the city and its quality of life. &#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with her on everything,&#8221; Mayor Bloomberg said in a press conference in Brooklyn shortly after Quinn&#8217;s election to speaker, &#8220;and I know she doesn&#8217;t agree with the administration on everything. But we&#8217;d be happy to work with whomever the City Council picks.&#8221; Perhaps the biggest issue Quinn and Bloomberg have locked horns over (or at least the one that the public is most aware of) was Quinn&#8217;s opposition to Bloomberg&#8217;s ultimately unsuccessful West Side Stadium plan. The mayor&#8217;s grand plan for the Hudson Rail Yards on the far West Side of Midtown Manhattan generated great controversy for the better part of a year&#8212;and was thought by many to be the linchpin in the city&#8217;s failed bid for the 2012 Olympic Games. From the start, Quinn&#8212;then representing the 3rd Council District, which included the Hudson Rail Yards and would have been home to the new football stadium complex&#8212;vigorously opposed the Bloomberg administration&#8217;s proposal. According to Quinn, the construction of a vast commercial stadium complex would have been done at the expense of the neighborhood&#8217;s housing stock (both affordable and market-rate), it&#8217;s open spaces, and its parkland. &#8220;It is a huge opportunity,&#8221; Quinn told New York magazine at the time. &#8220;And whatever we build, that&#8217;s it. We&#8217;re not going to do it again. I just don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s been the kind of process where anyone&#8217;s tried to determine what the city really needs. The planning was done after the goal had already been decided.&#8221; Since 1999, Quinn has been a leader on multiple fronts&#8212;she&#8217;s advocated for more comprehensive health care, equal rights for all New Yorkers, rational rezoning, better schools, and tenants&#8217; rights, and has spearheaded the move away from term limits for city council members. Currently, Quinn is exploring ways to compel the mayor to enforce the Dignity in All Schools Act, an anti-bullying measure for the city&#8217;s public schools. Both the benefits and the bullying measures were passed in 2004 over Bloomberg&#8217;s vetoes. Given her track record thus far, she may find success there as well. &#8220;She&#8217;s very effective and knows how to work well with people,&#8221; Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) told the Daily News. Nadler worked with Quinn to oppose the West Side stadium project. &#8220;She has a good rapport with different groups in the community.&#8221; Some of her other successes include helping to make New York City&#8217;s public spaces smoke-free, expanding access to emergency contraception to rape survivors and other New York City women, and increasing the availability of mammograms throughout the five boroughs. Quinn has mentioned on several occasions that her proudest accomplishment as a legislator has been with helping to save the Division of AIDS Services from elimination&#8212;as a separate, one-stop shopping agency for HIV-positive New Yorkers in need of city assistance&#8212;by Rudy Giuliani when he took office in 1994. Quinn helped organize thousands of people outside City Hall on the new mayor&#8217;s first full day on the job, a show of force that convinced the administration to back off its plan to do away with the division. Quinn has also been a vocal advocate for the improvement of public education, expanding computer labs in schools, renovating school playgrounds and buildings, rehabilitating libraries in her district, and expanding public schools&#8217; multicultural curriculum. &#8220;I very much support multicultural curriculum,&#8221; Quinn told representatives of the Empire State Pride Agenda (ESPA) during her most recent bid for re-election to her district council seat. &#8220;The schools in our diverse city have a responsibility to teach tolerance and respect for everyone.&#8221; The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) is another program Quinn is proud to be associated with. &#8220;I support and would sponsor legislation that would strengthen the independence of the Civilian Complaint Review Board,&#8221; Quinn told ESPA representatives. &#8220;The city council should guarantee sufficient funding to attract qualified staff who are familiar with law enforcement practices and can conduct thorough investigations. The CCRB should be empowered to perform independent investigations and be given the power to subpoena witness and prosecute abuses&#8230;it&#8217;s much more important to have an independent disciplinary procedure set up which is outside the Police Department.&#8221; Providing an affordable place to live has also been one of Quinn&#8217;s biggest platforms. In her own district, she negotiated the rezoning of the Hudson Yards, ensuring thousands more units of affordable housing, lower density along the waterfront, and more responsible financing. &#8220;For too many New Yorkers, the city is simply not affordable,&#8221; said Quinn in her response to the city council&#8217;s budget for 2006. &#8220;Hardworking, taxpaying, middle-class families are being squeezed out. The unemployment rate in many communities&#8212;especially among African-American and Latino men&#8212;remains unacceptably high. And the least fortunate among us worry every day about getting the basic necessities&#8212;food, shelter, and health care.&#8221; &#8220;We can&#8212;and we must&#8212;make City Hall work even more effectively for our constituents. We can listen harder and make government smarter. We can expand programs that work and still demand accountability and results. We can end the dysfunctional budget practices of the past and begin real oversight of city finances. And most importantly, we can learn from government&#8217;s mistakes&#8212;and from tragedies&#8212;so that we do not repeat them.&#8221; Quinn&#8217;s approach to city government may be summed up by George Arzt, former press secretary for former Mayor Ed Koch and long-time friend of Quinn. Arzt told the New York Times in early 2006 that Quin.n &#8220;is a person who&#8217;s not afraid to stand up for what she believes in but she tries to sit down and reason with you. If not, she will go her own way.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, we can be proud of achievements,&#8221; says Quinn, &#8220;but we must not be satisfied.&#8221; Keith Loria is a freelance writer and frequent contributor to The Cooperator.

A-P correspondent Mike Gracia reports Wednesday's apparent suicide at Guantanamo Bay is raising new criticism of the prison. SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico &mdash; A Saudi Arabian detainee who apparently committed suicide at Guantanamo Bay had been held at the prison camp reserved for the least compliant and most "high-value" inmates, a U.S. military spokesman said Thursday. The Saudi government identified the man who died Wednesday as Abdul Rahman Maadha al-Amry. A spokesman for the kingdom's Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, said it was too early to judge how al-Amry died. The U.S. military has not confirmed the detainee's identity or explained how it arrived at the conclusion that he probably committed suicide. "The actual cause of death is under investigation," Southern Command spokesman Jose Ruiz said by telephone from Miami on Thursday. Ruiz said the man was held at the maximum-security Camp 5. Guards at the U.S. Naval Base in southeast Cuba found the detainee unresponsive and not breathing in his cell Wednesday afternoon, the Southern Command announced Wednesday. It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. On June 10, 2006, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets. Prisoners in Camp 5, which is similar to the highest-security U.S. prisons, are kept in individual, solid-wall cells and allowed outside for only two hours a day of recreation in an enclosed area. Wells Dixon, a defense attorney who met with detainees at Camp 5 last month, said many showed signs of desperation. "I can assure you that it is hell on earth," Dixon said. "You can see the despair on the faces of detainees. It's transparent." Other critics said detainees are frustrated at being held indefinitely without charges. "You have five and a half years of desperation there with no legal way out," said Michael Ratner, president of the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents hundreds of Guantanamo detainees. "Sadly, it leads to people being so desperate they take their own lives." Lawyer Julia Tarver Mason, whose firm represents eight Saudi detainees at Guantanamo, said the government so far has declined to tell her if the man who died was among her clients. There are about 80 detainees from Saudi Arabia held at Guantanamo. "They are in the care of the United States government and that should mean that deaths should not occur," Mason said. The death came as Guantanamo prepares to hold pretrial hearings for two detainees in military tribunals. One of the detainees, Canadian Omar Khadr, fired his American attorneys on Wednesday, leaving him without defense counsel, his former U.S. military attorney told The Associated Press. Khadr is still to be arraigned Monday. He and Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni who also faces a hearing Monday, are among only three of the roughly 380 Guantanamo prisoners to be charged with a crime. The third, David Hicks, was convicted of aiding al-Qaida and returned to his native Australia. Khadr was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan during a firefight in which he allegedly killed a U.S. Army special forces soldier with a grenade. "He doesn't trust American lawyers, and I don't particularly blame him," said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who was taken off the case Wednesday. "The United States is responsible for his interrogation and his treatment under a process that is patently unfair." Many of the "enemy combatants" at the isolated prison camp have been held for more than five years. In most cases, the military accuses them of having links to al-Qaida or the Taliban. The former commander of the detention facilities, Navy Rear Adm. Harry Harris, described earlier suicides as acts of "asymmetric warfare" &mdash; an effort to increase condemnation of the prison. A cultural adviser was helping the military handle the remains. "The remains of the deceased detainee are being treated with the utmost respect," the military said. Associated Press writers Andrew O.

The days of racial politics returned with a fury at a heated City Council meeting yesterday, when Brooklyn Councilman Al Vann tried to restore the name of the late black activist Sonny Carson to an honorary street-renaming bill. The ensuing debate was punctuated by cheers and jeers from a gallery packed with supporters of Carson, who died in 2002. They remembered him as a man who shut down crack houses and helped found Medgar Evers College. Many in the Council, however, recalled Carson as an ex-convict, race-baiter and leader of boycotts against Korean groceries. Carsons name had been stripped from a bill of 51 other street designations in April, after Speaker Christine Quinn came out against it, describing the activist as a divisive figure known for his anti-white rhetoric. In submitting his amendment, Vann made the case that renaming four blocks of Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant was not about honoring Carson but rather about respecting one communitys wishes. The proposed designation had come to the Council only after the community board overwhelmingly approved it. I dont want you to vote for Sonny Carson, Vann said. I want you to vote for the democratic principle. But true to Carsons vision, Vann could not overlook the legacy of race. I believe people of goodwill oftentimes make a lot of mistakes because they dont understand the people that theyre dealing with, Vann said, launching into a history lesson, with a detailed description of a slave ship and the consequences of Jim Crow. He spoke of the succession of less than human labels bestowed on blacks, from the n-word to Negro to minority. The constant thing for us, as black people, has been self-determination, he said. I know, a street renaming sounds so innocuous, so routine. And yet now its not that  youve hit a nerve. Youre harking back to a time weve already overcome. Councilman Charles Barron took the matter personally. Repeatedly refusing calls to sit down, he singled out black Councilwoman Leticia James for abstaining at an earlier vote and warned others with aspirations for citywide office not to show up at black churches. We are remembering this day, he said, turning on Quinn. You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever divided any people. Councilman Bill de Blasio said he worked with Carson on the 1989 mayoral campaign of David Dinkins. He was a strong community leader, de Blasio said, though ultimately a negative one. A street renaming is done on behalf of all the people, he added. My conscience says that we should vote no. Councilman Oliver Koppell agreed, saying it would be wrong to honor someone who was a representative of achieving ends by threatening violence. Councilwoman Helen Foster accused Koppell of historical amnesia. Violence was defined by this country when they took Africans from their country, Foster said. I am the daughter of a man who saw his first lynching at 7 years old in Alabama. Quinn finally stood up to speak amid a shower of heckling. I believe the record is clear, she said. He was not an individual who sought to bring our city together. The Council shot down the amendment 25-15, with 7 abstentions.

It had tied the old record of 8.97 feet above sea level early on Wednesday before a day of sun evaporated more water from the lake. Officials said they will measure water depth again sometime Thursday morning and announce the new record low level for the largest lake in the southern United States and the second largest fresh water lake in the nation. It is also the back up drinking water source for the 5 million people in South Florida. The lake should be around 13 feet above sea level this time of year. Dried vegetation on the lake bottom fueled a 12,000-acre fire on the lake around northern rim on Monday that was 50 percent contained on Wednesday. The drought has caused more water restrictions for the 5 million people who call South Florida home. Lake Okeechobee serves as the primary back up reservoir for Miami and the rest of the area during summer droughts. However, with lake levels at historic lows, officials have tightened water restrictions on South Florida residents, businesses and farms. In addition, four well fields have been shut down in South Florida to prevent salt-water intrusion. For the year, the region has been well below normal for rainfall with only seven inches of rain so far. ''There's nothing coming back in," Randy Smith, spokesman for the South Florida Water Management District, told the Miami Herald Wednesday. "There's just no recharge whatsoever.'' Although it is only the end of May, officials say that they doubt that the lake will receive enough rain during the remainder of 2007 to bring the lake up to safe levels so that it can used as a back up reservoir for 2008 either. Officials say that it could take years of above average rainfall to bring lake levels back up again. Copyright © AHN Media Corp - All rights reserved.

Bush has nominated Robert Zoellick - a former government official with cosy ties to corporate America and extreme right-wing views - to take over as head of the controversy-stricken World Bank. Officials in Washington said that Bush expected the board of the bank to accept the nomination, thereby putting a damper on the scandal surrounding the organization's out-going president, Paul Wolfowitz. The U.S. -- which as the bank's biggest lender traditionally nominates its president -- is insistent that another American fill the top job despite calls from some countries -- especially in Europe -- to open the process to candidates from around the world. But while the Bush administration expressed confidence that Robert Zoellick will be accepted by the World Bank board, critics point out that Zoellick has had close ties to corporate America. He is the head of investment bank Goldman Sachs and previously served on the board of Enron, the world's largest oil company and also submerged in the mire of controversy. In government, Robert Zoellick served at the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush, Sr and under his son, he served as deputy Secretary of State and U.S. Trade Representative. Politically, Zoellick is closely aligned with the right-wing neo-conservatives. In 1998, he was a signatory to the mission statements of the Project for the New American Century, which called for increased military budgets and the ousting of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Several years later, he wrote an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine which imagined a U.S. foreign policy far more interventionist than initially imagined by Bush as he sought the presidency. He wrote: "A modern Republican foreign policy recognizes that there is still evil in the world, people who hate America and the ideas for which it stands" -- adding that the U.S. "must remain vigilant and have the strength to defeat its enemies."

Speaking at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga., Bush said Tuesday that arguments about the bill allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the country use the word "amnesty," which he said is not the case. "This bill is not an amnesty bill. If you want to scare the American people, what you say is, the bill is an amnesty bill. It's not an amnesty bill," Bush said. "For the skeptics who say that we are not concerned about border security or workplace enforcement, they need to read the bill." The bill says illegal immigrants who want to stay in the United States must apply for a new Z visa. To receive the visa, illegal workers must admit they violated the law, pay a fine, pass a strict background check, hold a job, maintain a clean record and learn English. A recent Senate amendment also stipulates illegal immigrants must pay back taxes as well. The measure also penalizes employers who knowingly employ illegal immigrants.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/nyregion/31parade.html&cid Judge Decides Against a Mayor Who Banned Cuban Parade - New York Times Judge Decides Against a Mayor Who Banned Cuban Parade Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: CITY, May 30 &#151; The parade must go on. A Superior Court judge ruled here on Wednesday that the Cuban Parade of could not be prohibited from going through West New York, despite the contention of its mayor that the event did not do enough to recognize the plight of the Cuban people. The decision, by Judge Maurice J. Gallipoli, came two weeks after Mayor Silverio A. Vega of West New York denied a permit to organizers of the eighth annual parade, casting into disarray a festival that sponsors said would attract 350,000 onlookers. After the hearing, the parade&#8217;s founder and chief executive, Emilio Del Valle, said, &#8220;Obviously, I&#8217;m pleased.&#8221; Mr. Vega, who emigrated from when he was 10, had threatened to physically block the parade, which is Sunday, if it tried to come through his town. But he modified that stance on Wednesday. &#8220;I respect the decision of the judge,&#8221; Mr. Vega said after the hearing, adding that although he was not encouraging people to block the parade, they &#8220;might be inclined&#8221; to do so. Mr. Vega&#8217;s lawyer, Daniel E. Horgan, said he was not sure whether his client would appeal. The decision sent organizers scurrying to rearrange the route yet again. The parade typically travels south from North Bergen through Guttenberg, West New York and Union City. But when Mr. Vega denied the permit, organizers decided to limit the parade to Union City, shortening the route by about a mile. After the decision, Mr. Del Valle said he was not sure whether the parade would go through Guttenberg or North Bergen, although Mr. Vega said that according to his reading of the judge&#8217;s orders, it must travel along its original route. Critics of Mr. Vega said that he blocked the parade because he did not want to be seen with Brian P. Stack, the mayor of neighboring Union City, with whom he is engaged in a heated Democratic primary campaign for State Senate. The election will be held two days after the parade. In court, Mr. Horgan contended that the town was right to deny the permit because the organizers were a &#8220;fraud.&#8221; He said the organization, the Latin American Kiwanis Club, had misrepresented itself as a nonprofit group on its application, while operating as a profit-making group. But Elise Di Nardo, a lawyer for Mr. Del Valle, said that the status of the group was irrelevant in denying the permit, and that the issue should be whether the parade posed any &#8220;governmental interest or governmental concern,&#8221; on issues like traffic or crowds. Several times in the hearing, an obviously annoyed Judge Gallipoli referred to the proceedings as &#8220;nonsense,&#8221; saying finally, &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to make sense of nonsense.&#8221; Next Article in New York Region (5 of 24) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

There were identified as 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman, 24, of Norwich, Conn., and Chief Warrant Officer Theodore Church, 32, of Ohio. The soldiers were flying an OH-58D Kiowa helicopter that crashed in Muqdadiyah after receiving heavy enemy fire during combat operations, the Defense Department said. They were part of the 2nd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division based at Schofield. Six other soldiers died in a roadside-bomb ambush as they tried to rescue the two pilots, according to the Associated Press. The AP also reported today that Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believes the aircraft was brought down by small arms fire, and that the roadside bomb that killed a response team headed to the crash site was not the newer, armor piercing explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs, that have killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers. In high school Heidtman was an all-conference baseball player, a basketball player and an honor student, said his stepfather Arthur Robidoux. Robidoux, said his stepson joined the Army after graduating from University of Connecticut in 2005 with a bachelors degree in resource economics. After earning his wings Heidtman was assigned to the 25th Division in May 2006, and left for Iraq in December, Robidoux said. Robidoux told the Star-Bulletin that although he doesnt support the war Iraq, I support what he decided to do. Human life is a terrible thing to lose, especially the young people with a purpose in life, Robidoux said. Unfortunately they paid the ultimate price. I didnt agree with his choice (to join the military), but I do support him. Robidoux pointed out that 10 soldiers were killed or wounded on Memorial Day. My heart goes out to those affected soldiers  past and present. This isnt going to end any time soon. All these men and women are leaving behind young families. Heidtmans mother and father, Maureen Robidoux and Kerry Heidtman, and were notified of his death early yesterday morning. He also is survived by a sister, Keely Heidtman. The family, while devastated by the loss, is proud of his service to the country, said Arthur Robidoux. His perspective on life was pretty good. He had focus. He had drive. He did what he thought he could do best. He died for it. &copy; 2007 Honolulu Star-Bulletin --

He cast the debate as a struggle over America's soul and its reputation as a welcoming nation. "I'm deeply concerned about America losing its soul. Immigration has been the lifeblood of a lot of our country's history," the president said during an exclusive interview with McClatchy Newspapers on Air Force One. "I am worried that a backlash to newcomers would cause our country to lose its great capacity to assimilate newcomers." Bush underscored his commitment to the proposed overhaul -- despite harsh criticism from some conservatives -- as he traveled to Georgia for a speech that blasted the legislation's critics. "I'm sure you've heard some of the talk out there about people defining the bill. It's clear they hadn't read the bill. They're speculating about what the bill says, and they're trying to rile up people's emotions," he told an audience at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, near Brunswick. "If you want to kill the bill, if you don't want to do what's right for America, you can pick one little aspect out of it, you can use it to frighten people. Or you can show leadership and solve this problem once and for all." Conservative critics contend the proposal amounts to an amnesty program because illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay in the country after paying $1,000 fines. Some liberals complain that plans for a new temporary worker program are overly restrictive and would create a permanent underclass of foreign workers. Sitting in his spacious office on the presidential aircraft, Bush traced his commitment to immigration to his time in Texas. "When you grow up in Texas like I did, you recognize the decency and humanity of Hispanics. And the truth of the matter is, a lot of this immigration debate is driven as a result of Latinos being in our country," he said. "I have seen firsthand the beautiful stories of people being able to take advantage of opportunity and make solid contributions to our society." He said Americans have nothing to fear from large-scale immigration from Latin America. "There is an element of our society that is worried about two Americas," he said. "Our ability to welcome newcomers and the system's capacity to assimilate them has been one of the great powerful traditions of America. It works, and it will work this time." Bush expressed hope that the changes would reduce the need for a fence along the border with Mexico. The proposed fence has drawn protests in Texas, where officials fear it will hinder commerce and cause environmental problems.

(Photo: Doug Mills/The New York Times) Valerie Plame Wilson&#8217;s covert status at the C.I.A. is old news for many observers of the inquiry into the leaking of her identity. One side of the political divide argued that she was actually on desk duty at Langley at the time of Robert Novak&#8217;s infamous column naming her, which would mean that the leaking of her identity was, if not exactly nice, not illegal either. The other side, and Ms. Wilson herself, said the opposite. Patrick Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor, could have easily cleared up the confusion during his more than two years of prosecuting the case, but he waited until now. Ms. Wilson &#8220;was a covert employee,&#8221; Mr. Fitzgerald wrote, according to Newsweek . &#8220;The CIA was taking affirmative measures to conceal her intelligence relationship to the United States.&#8221; More While assigned to CPD, Ms. Wilson engaged in temporary duty (TDY) travel overseas on official business. She traveled at least seven times to more than ten countries. When traveling overseas, Ms. Wilson always traveled under a cover identity â sometimes in true name and sometimes in alias â but always using cover â whether official or non-official cover (NOC) â with no ostensible relationship to the CIA. Those statements emerged in a court filing concerning the pending sentencing of Lewis I. Libby, Vice President Cheney&#8217;s former chief of staff, who was convicted on five felony counts of obstruction of justice and perjury in the matter, but was not charged with violating the Intelligence Identities Act of 1982 So if Ms. Wilson was indeed covert, why wasn&#8217;t Mr. Libby, or anyone else who spread her name and affiliation around, charged with breaking that law? Kevin Drum at The Washington Monthly brings up another prerequisite under the law &#8220;The leakers had to know that leaking Plame&#8217;s name could be damaging, and Fitzgerald didn&#8217;t think he had the evidence to make that case,&#8221; he surmised. 84 comments so far... As Fitzgerald states in the sentencing documents, the reason he did not have the evidence to make the case was because Libby lied and muddied the waters. Fitzgerald was unable to determine if the Vice President was intentionally violating the Intelligence Identies Act because Libby lied about his role in the outing of Plame. Best Having tried a few murder cases, and been an in- telligence officer here and overseas, I&#8217;d like to weigh in on this. In fact, my question is a simple one: if this gal was &#8220;covert,&#8221; how is it that so many &#8220;spread her name and affiliation around?&#8221; Oh, well, maybe she was a little bit (pregnant)covert. BTW, that was a nice little (good-paying) gig for The Prosecutor. Nick Why didn&#8217;t someone tell her husband before he began spouting off to every news organ about his Niger follies. Easy- Patrick Fitzgerald is not the independent prosecutor he was portrayed to be. Hard to believe, but now it is obvious. He took down Libby in order to spare those who had obvious intent- Cheney, Rove, and probably W too. They left a written trail of intent, for crying out loud. Democrats are spineless wimps- there is more than enough evidence here to investigate and impeach those three, but that will never happen. There is no difference between a democrat and a republican. They are all Republicrats, and they are stealing our country. Vote Independent. There&#8217;s something else that always drives me nuts about the Bushie argument that revealing her identity casued no harm: it&#8217;s not like she was actually working undercover at the time she was &#8220;outted&#8221; after all&#8230; Outting her as an operative of any kind makes ALL the people overseas who had contact with her, whether they were the reason for her travels or not, vunerable to the accusation that they were working with the CIA, and therefore vunerable to retailiation for spying for the US. Doesn&#8217;t matter if they were working with her or not. How does a contact trust they can work with a CIA operative? How does anyone in a sensitive region trust working with any US citizen? Not the kind of thing that is going to help US operatives in the future and will certainly dampen enthusiasm for knowingly working with the CIA. That result is ironic and stupid when you consider the degree the Republicans decried the deteriation in person-to-person operations during the Clinton administration. I would not be surprised if this one bungle, committed for very limited and obtuse political gain, has done far more damage to personal covert operations then all the years of Clinton&#8217;s operational red tape and moral limits combined. Underfoot The sentencing will be a delight to watch and read about. All of the participants in this shameful episode will be back on the front page. The perfidy of Rove and crew back in the limelight. The public can only benefit from being reminded of the extreme lengths this group would go to defend lies about Iraq&#8217;s nuclear program. perrry If the leakers of Plame&#8217;s identity didn&#8217;t &#8220;know&#8221; that leaking her name would be damaging, then they are more stupid that I realized or they just didn&#8217;t care or both. What a tragedy! One should read the book written in the 1930&#8217;s which deals with America becoming a fascist dictatorship. Diamond The aim of the Iraq invasion was, according to the neocons, the installation of democracy in Iraq, from where it would spread into the rest of the region. One of the things fundamental to democracy is the availability of truth to the voting citizens. Valerie Plame (Wilson) was outed as punishment for her husband&#8217;s telling of the truth, and the action was quite clearly meant to be a demonstration of the consequences of telling truths wich which confounded the aims of the elected government. Why should others value your &#8220;democracy&#8221; if you obviously give it no value? may Loyal Bushies just continue to amaze me. They have argued indefatiguably for years that Valerie Plame wasn&#8217;t covert. Then she gave SWORN TESTIMONY that she WAS covert, and Loyal Bushies STILL questioned the FACTS. I will bet money that this article doesn&#8217;t change a thing for them; somehow Victoria Toensing and the rest of the Loyal Bushies will continue to somehow, someway believe that Valerie Plame was not covert. How do they know? Because a Loyal Bushie told &#8216;em so! âThe leakers had to know that leaking Plameâs name could be damaging, and Fitzgerald didnât think he had the evidence to make that case,â he surmised. Perhaps I&#8217;m a cynic but I find it interesting that Ms. Plame&#8217;s status at the CIA (covert or not) wasn&#8217;t a major focus of the investigation or given much attention even in press accounts until the publication of her memoir. Fitzgerald may not have had the evidence to make the case, but the intent of the leakers could not be more obvious. What, they did it &#8220;by acccident?&#8221; That&#8217;s a four year old kid&#8217;s excuse. Oh, wait, that&#8217;s just about exactly the level they operate on. Turner Travelling undercover does not, to me, mean covert assignment. All CIA employees likely travel that way both in US and to overseas destinations(vacations). Why? Because they could be squeezed for names, classified info, or any other bits that might later fill in a mosaic for the other side/s.My opinion isshe never was on a covert mission. Some people at CIA love to name drop and play the role just like some power hungry law enforcement officers. Drop in to Vienna, Va sometime. Schweitzer, Sr Of course Wilson was covert. It was CIA who requested the investigation into her blown cover in the first place. The real crime of libby is that by lying he has prevented those who actually broke the law in revealing her identity from being brought to justice. And probably in at least one individual&#8217;s case stopped his impeachment. It is amazing that the same folks who were frothing at the mouth about a fib concerning a consensual adult tryst are now making every excuse they can think of to justify sacrificing national security and potentially under cover operatives lives to scare a few political points. On deeper reflection it is not amazing at all, because the whole Lewinsky/starr affair was all about sacrificing the good of the nation to score a few cheap political points too. Walker In other words, it was like Fitzgerald stated at his press conference when he announced the Libby indictments: Libby&#8217;s lies threw sand in the face of the umpire so that no one could pin a thing on Cheney. Libby&#8217;s lies were so lame and transparent that it is hard to believe that a lawyer of his experience (it is entertaining to note that it was Libby who represented Mark Rich when he was pardoned by Clinton) would not know that his false statements would be uncovered almost immediately. Meanwhile the clock tick tocked away and Cheney is still firmly in power. Ted Wells called him a scapegoat&#8211;the truth is that it appears that he was a willing scapegoat. in Brooklyn President Bush will pardon Libby, as the Senate pardoned Clinton after his conviction (impeachment). And the world will &#8216;little note, nor long remember&#8217; Plame, Wilson, Fitzgerald, Scooter, Burger, Gonzales, di Grandpa Why is it that a simple person like myself, who has no real insight into the going-ons of the C.I.A., would, nevertheless, have the common sense not to give away the identity of one of my country&#8217;s secret service operatives? Robert Novak is far beyond me in his famed and privileged role as a Major Newspaper columnist. I suspect he would know, or should have known, even better than I, about not reporting the identity of Valarie Plame Wilson. Kelley Wilson should have shut up about &#8220;his Niger Follies&#8221;? Excuse me, but they weren&#8217;t &#8220;his follies&#8221;, the folly was dumya and his gang of neo cons who made up the story of the yellowcake in the first place. Sadly, Wilson speaking up wasn&#8217;t able to deter the runup to the war, but given the aftermath of this huge debacle (forever to be known as &#8220;dumyas war&#8221; in the history books, hopefully) the only folly was on the narrow minded, blind fools who perpetuated the myth, not Mr. Wilsons. And yeah, let&#8217;s all be loyal to our stupid in chief, let&#8217;s keep quiet when he commits gross acts of incompetency, etc&#8230;.gee, I am sure if they had bloggers back in the day people would have been sayying the same thing about Hitler and Stalin, too, that it doesn&#8217;t matter what he does, he is &#8220;our leader&#8221;. *phah*. It is ironic that we are fighting a war supposedly to bring democracy to Iraq, and we have supporters who decry the very thing democracy is supposed to be about, clear and transparent government answerable to the people. An impeachment isn&#8217;t a conviction, Al. The Senate didn&#8217;t &#8216;pardon&#8217; Clinton, it acquitted him. I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s wise for &#8220;covert&#8221; agents to meet with Washington Post reporters and attend Democratic events with their spouses at a time of self instigated controversy. We know the press well enough to know they will research every detail about a public figure. My question is why Armitage wasn&#8217;t assigned more blame. Plame is covert. If the Democrats were as nasty and hellish as the Republicans were in getting Clinton impeached over lying about a BJ, Plame&#8217;s outing could be made to stick and Fitzgerald could go after Cheney Rove etc. There is no will. The Plame outing is nasty warning to ordinary citizens by the bullies of this administration. Bushies have power and they will use it. We the people have been cowed including the media. We could pound the lies of Bush over and over and over until they are all censured and shamed. THE FACT that Ms. Wilson is working for the CIA don&#8217;t make any difference whether she is doing a desk job or not, the identity of an employee of the CIA must be ALWAYS protected from being publish because they maybe called upon to do a covert work later or done covert work in the past. Verdict: Send the VicePresident, Scooter Libby & Novak to jail. C&#8217;mon guys let get serious about this matter do the right thing. Anthony I find it truly mystifying that so long after this happened, this basic point of fact still remains in dispute in the minds of various right-wing crazies. It has been widely known since the outing that Plame was indeed undercover, the CIA stated so years ago. There has never, ever, been any evidence that she was not. There has only been the need on the part of those people who are for whatever strange reason, still loyal to the disgraced George Bush, to simply believe that she was not covert in order to minimize the nature of this crime and try to pretend it wasn&#8217;t actually a blatant betrayal of our country. In these fools&#8217; minds, it will never matter what the truth is. The truth is only what they want to believe. Clinton was not convicted and, of course, not pardoned either. Take a quick read of the constitution and you will figure it out. It is amazing to me after all this time that so many people are still willing to either give the administration credit for this issue or feign ignorance in order to protect it. Valerie Plame was a spy. Her husband, Robert Wilson, was a defense department analyst. He openly challenged the adminstration over the blatantly erroneous charge that Saddam Hussein had purchased &#8220;yellowcake&#8221; uranium from Niger. Then the administration, via Robert Novak, outed Ms. Plame to demonstrate what they were willing to do to ensure that their war in Iraq not be derailed. It is pretty simple really. This is the worst, most corrupt, and simultaneously most incompetent (except when it comes to filling coffers and protecting the guilty) administration in all of American history and they have gotten away with EVERYTHING! Oakland, California Republic. Dear Al di Grandpa, the Senate did not &#8220;pardon&#8221; Clinton. I guess the basics of how our government works elude you, but then maybe not. Right-wingnut ignorance is so often evidently willful, as some of the comments above make clear. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether *we* think Plame was &#8220;covert&#8221; or not, her employer, the CIA, says she was, and she was. Plame was working on nuclear proliferation issues, the very issue the Bushies whipped up into a froth to get their war, which has turned into a total disaster. (Quite a few intelligent people knew it would well before the fact, but that&#8217;s another issue.) It&#8217;s too bad that Fitzgerald wasn&#8217;t able to nail all of the creeps who committed what really is a treasonous act: Cheney, Rove, Armitage, Novak, all of them. But then the iron&#8217;s still in the fire for Rove, so the Congress and a Special Prosecutor may still get him on his crimes, either sooner or later. We&#8217;ll greatly note and long remember all the problems he caused. Prosecutors are asking 30 to 37 months in prison for Scooter Libby. Patrick Fitzgerald defends his request, saying that Libby &#8220;corrupted the judicial system&#8221; â yet there was no crime found to have been committed as a part of the so-called âoutingâ. [Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage is the person who âoutedâ her. Not Scooter Libby or Karl Rove.] I wonder if Valerie Plame will have her own troubles from Senator Bondâs ongoing investigation into her accounts of this event. Sheâs now apparently given three different versions of her own testimony &#8230; 1) She told told the CIA Inspector General that she suggested her husband for the trip; 2) She told the Senate committee staff she could not remember whether she suggested her husband or her boss did; 3) She told the House committee, emphatically, that she did not suggest him. I look forward to further results of the on-going Senate investigation into the veracity of this âinnocent and sadly-malignedâ CIA agent. It is just disgusting to see the depth putrid ness this government sunk to begin the deceitful Republican War in Iraq. Many respectable Americans, including Plame, reputations and work potential has been damaged or destroyed because of the Republican War in Iraq. As the future of the Republican War in Iraq continues to look bleak, we are also forced to endure incompetents like Alberto Gonzalez who squirms like a worm on a hook because of the damage he caused with his Stevie Wonder like destruction of American Jurisprudence. We laugh at the clown acts of Bushâs neo-con buddies like Condi and Cheney. We shrug off huge deficits, raging gas prices, the rich prospering while the middle class remains stagnant, milk $6 and change per gal etc in support of our Monarch. There is one thing that we can be sure of, Bush and his neo-con buddies will continue to fight the Republican War in Iraq against a ghost named terror at the cost of tens of billions of dollars without flinching. Bush, who I consider to be Neanderthalish, is smart enough to understand that a victory over terror is not possible because terror is a ghost. Bush also understands that a loss to terror is equally impossible for the same reason. We can also be sure that a gullible conservative American society will follow this black sheep government over the steepest cliff without flinching. IMPEACH THE REPUBLICAN WAR IN IRAQ. Tesstimony at the Waxman/Reid committee by admittedly Republican ex-CIA agents confirmed her activities overseas using private passport esposing her to unprotected treatment by foreign governments. Outing closed down a CIA front in Beirut marking everyone who went in or out. This partial list of consequences reveals &#8220;aid and comfort to the enemy&#8221; comonly known as High Treason. BRING A ROPE! F. Dever Mr. Nizza inaccurately writes, &#8220;Fitzgerald&#8230; could have easily cleared up the confusion during his more than two years of prosecuting the case&#8230;&#8221; In fact, when Fitzgerald announced the indictment on 10/28/05, he specifically stated that Agent Plame&#8217;s true identity was classified and that her cover was blown by Robert Novak&#8217;s column. These facts also were included in the official indictment itself. There was never any &#8220;confusion&#8221; about Agent Plame&#8217;s covert status, just Republican disinformation spread by right-wing Republican political operatives. It&#8217;s a shame &#8211;but no surprise&#8211; how easily The Right sides with the terrorists and attacks those who defend America when their political misdeeds get exposed. Rionero This is interesting word play with &#8220;covert.&#8221; All you need to know is she drove every day to the CIA headquarters in her family car right through the front gate. Any intelligence agency in the world knows the license plates numbers of the people who work at CIA (or should if they own cameras). Oh, and the secret spy name she used, Valerie Plame? That was her maiden name. The maiden name that her husband listed in his entry of his spouse in Who&#8217;s Who in Washington. So, Joe W publishes his fantasy tale of mint tea in Niger. Intelligence agencies around the world look him up and see he was married to Valirie Plame. It does not take too long to connect the dots. Maybe people should be more concerned about Sandy Berger stealing and destroying classified docs that were supposed to go the 9/11 commission. AG Is that the same attorney who helped defend the so called blind shiek? His name was Fitzgerald if I remember correctly. spencer The reason Plame&#8217;s name was released is because Wilson lied to the press and asserted that the Vice President&#8217;s office had recommended him for the Niger fact-finding mission. This was a lie. The Vice President&#8217;s office was simply stating the facts: Wilson&#8217;s wife had recommended him. Much ado about nothing. Scooter was railroaded. OK, fine, Libby lied. Why does that bring the process full stop? Doesn&#8217;t the system often cope with lying witnesses? Aren&#8217;t there ways to still go after the perps? keyes I don&#8217;t understnd why Novack and his publisher were not persued for actually publishing this story. Can someone tell me please? korda I hear the loud sound of Bushies slapping each other on the back for a job well done. c Although this should settle the matter once and for all, it has long been settled as an inferential matter. Why? Because there would have been no basis &#8212; none &#8212; for an investigation and the appointment of a special counsel, had Plame not been established to the Justice Department&#8217;s satisfaction that Plame was covert in the first place. Otherwise, there would have been no potential violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act to investigate. To believe otherwise, one must ascribe nefarious motives to *both* the notoriously independent and professional Patrick Fitzgerald, and the man who appointed him, the equally independent and professional James Comey. How the news media consistently failed to make this simple, inescapable inference and report it escapes me. But they are guilty of it again and again and again. For years we have been hearing from certain pundits and editorial pages that Plame was not covert. And for years anyone in possession of a few facts and a few brain cells to rub together have known better, or should have. I can&#8217;t believe those on this board defending her outing by suggesting that she was only partly covert. Even if she was partly covert, that is enough and it is ATROCIOUS that she was outed for polical purposes in what turns out to be a PREEMPTIVE WAR under false (i.e. LIES) pretenses. Old Nick #2 is not a patriot no matter what he thinks. And if Old Nick really is an &#8220;intelligence&#8221; officer here and overseas, God help us. That explains why we are so ignorant as to the goings on abroad and are more at risk than ever before. Also, Fitzgerald&#8217;s credibility is sound. Who do you believe, Fitzgerald or Bush, Cheney and Rove? Valerie Plame may have been technically &#8220;covert,&#8221; but the idea that exposing her identity could have resulted in any significant harm to U.S. intelligence activities is risible. Covert intelligence has never been the U.S.&#8217;s long suit, but given the recent deterioration in the CIA&#8217;s covert capabilities and tradecraft as a result of periodic Congressional purges, it is almost certain that her covers were so thin as to be almost transparent. It would be amazing if Ms. Plame&#8217;s identity wasn&#8217;t known to the intelligence organs of every country in which she set foot the moment she cleared passport control. Seal To S.B. Poster #4- &#8220;Vote Independent&#8221;? Are you kidding? Maybe it&#8217;s just the part of the country I live in, but every &#8220;Independent&#8221; that runs for office is a Republican trying to hide. A politician who calls him/herself &#8220;independent&#8221; is like one who calls him/herself a &#8220;moderate&#8221;. If you have to say it, it ain&#8217;t so. It was the beginning of America realizing the Republican party could not be trusted and would harm the country for their own advantage. Folks - pull up to 25,000 feet here&#8230; if you&#8217;re defending Bush, claiming Wilson wasn&#8217;t covert, and generally saying it&#8217;s OK to out her whether covert or not, then you&#8217;re defending lying, dirty tricks, doing end runs around the constitution, the law and the people of the US. So, why not just admit you believe in the end justifies the means and that you have no respect for our democracy or for our laws? Then again, I can&#8217;t say I blame you when this country cares more about American Idol than all of our soldiers serving our country. in SD It&#8217;s amusing to see how some are still in denial, still trying to pass blame, still coming up with lame remarks in defense of the stupid and dangerous disclosures that resulted in the exposure of one of our country&#8217;s covert CIA officers. They&#8217;ve demonstrated where their loyalties lie &#8212; with the GOP, not with truth our nation or it&#8217;s security. Geriatrics, who have perhaps never served at the end of the whip in either the intel /military communities, may not remember anything of importance to those who did. Those of us, who did serve in positions at the expense of our personal lives, will never forget how the Clinton clowns thoroughly succeeded in paving the way for disasters like WTC I /II (911 to you grampa) by emasculating the mil/intel communities and appointing PC nimrods with whom they never met privately anyway. As you have computer access, suggest you do some homework; and if you use the BR, remember to clean up after yourself. Flotsam The order of events tells the real story. 1) Armitage disclosed his identity as the leaker to Colin Powell immediately when it came out. 2) The CIA determined early on that there would be no prosecution as the trial would do more harm to national security than the leak itself. 3) They then referred the matter to the FBI. 4) That being the case, the investigation by the FBI was for what purpose? Apparently, the only real purpose here was to distract from Plame&#8217;s own misconduct in recommending her husband for the trip to Niger. Under the now defunct special prosecutor law, the special prosecutor is obligated to follow the US Attorney&#8217;s guidelines for prosecution. Fiztgerald must have known in advance there wouild be no prosecution of the underlying charge, making the taking of testimony from Libby a perjury trap, a violation of the guidelines. Zingher, esq They all knew she was covert whether Fitzgerald was able to prove it or not. It was just a matter of politics to smear a critic who exposed their lies, and the best form of revenge was to go after his wife even if she was a covert CIA agent. Are they in any sense believable after their lies are being exposed every day.You have to expect something dastardly from this bunch. Lest one forgets that perpetual war was the Rovian strategy to keep a Republican lock on the White House and Congress and this type of thinking is what got us into this mess in Iraq. If the war in Iraq is so central to keep the terrorists away from harming this country how come none of their kids are volunteering to serve this country in Iraq. Libby was just the sacrificial lamb and will get pardoned by Bush. Ramanand Gee &#8212; Nobody has told me what she was doing so I don&#8217;t think she was doing anything covert. Please rejoin the reality-based community. Who do you think would tell you what covert things she was doing? She testified she was covert and the CIA backed her up from the beginnning. Her husband in an act of pure patriotism corrected a lie told by the President of the United States. (Well, a weasel lie, he said the British think &#8212; neve mind that we know better and that the CIA took the line out several times before missing it in the last go round on the speech.) Wilson thought the &#8216;publican party office holders would have enough ethics not to put Valerie&#8217;s contacts at risk no matter how angry they were with him for exposing the Bush&#8217;s dishonesty. So far anyone who has trusted them has been wrong. In the five years before Valerie Plame&#8217;s alleged &#8220;outing,&#8221; she married Joe Wilson, was pregnant with twins, had postpartum depression for an unspecified period of time &#8212; all mentioned in Joe Wilson&#8217;s book. Since she was on maternity leave for at least 15 months and who knows how long on sick leave for the postpartum depression and probably pressed for time raising twins and recovering from her depression, which can take years, exactly when did she have time to be covert? While the media knew these facts during the timeframe of the Niger trip and Bob Novak&#8217;s column, how often have they reported the facts of her pregnancy and illness. Gives another perspective to the story, doesn&#8217;t it? Yup, everybody will come out just fine. Plame gets some book deal and her washed-up, has-been &#8220;Ambassador&#8221; hubby got his 15 minutes worth in this paper. Together their apex was the fab Vanity Fair piece. Old Republican workhorse Libby gets a pardon. It&#8217;s the perfect Hollywood ending. The problem for all of us is that&#8217;s all the Dems seem to be capable of these days&#8230;Hollywood endings. NY I&#8217;m astonished at the number of ridiculous arguments made here. Old Nick sniggers at the money Fitzgerald must have made, a charge I doubt he made about Ken Starr&#8217;s five year fishing expedition that ended with a charge of perjury. To suggest that Fitzgerald was disingenuous has no basis. He was assigned to look into the Plame leak and he did just that. To question his motives, considering he was reportedly a Republican, also has no basis. Then we have Dan who says it was Joe Wilson&#8217;s fault she was outted because he went to Niger. Then SB says Fitzgerald&#8217;s protecting Cheney et al, which, if he&#8217;d read Fitzgerald&#8217;s sentencing report pointing at those same people, he&#8217;d understand differently. There are conspiracies aplenty in this Administration, the most impeachable in our history, but you&#8217;ve got to back them up no matter what side you&#8217;re on. Doze With the smell of war profits in the air, no price was too large to get the war machine kicked into motion. SO what if treason is committed and the american people are lied to and their rights trampled. What are the lives of a few career spooks, tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of iraqies, thousands of dead and injured american solidiers, sailors and marines, when there is easy american tax-payer money to be made/stolen and an empire to be built. Riddle me this&#8230;who forged the Niger Yellow Cake Memorandum? You know, the one referenced by those &#8220;sixteen words&#8221;, the one that Joe Wilson&#8217;s trip revealed to be a fake, the one which implicity led Valerie Wilson to be outed. Who has the capability to create a forgery that could fool the U.S., even for a short period of time? Who had the motivation to fabricate an piece of intelligence, and the means to place it &#8220;upstream&#8221; so that it could float down at the right time to justify this bogus war? Why is no one asking? Hamaway Clinton was not &#8220;convicted.&#8221; To be &#8220;convicted&#8221; the Senate would have had to vote for that status. He was &#8220;indicted.&#8221; Why use language if you don&#8217;t really care what it actually means? This is more than any other reason why this country and culture is headed down the tubes. And ol Al di Grandpa thinks he&#8217;s so smart and cynical and knows what&#8217;ll happen. People are so deliberately untruthful to themselves. Osburn Fitzgerald knew the source of the leak to Novak was Richard Armitage before the grand jury even started taking testimony. The investigation should have ended there. Everything done after was just a witch hunt. This administration violates the Espionage Act of 1917. High crimes and misdemeanors. Impeachable offence. It seems this administration is keen on hiring Alzheimer patients who can&#8217;t remember anything and bad lawyers who can&#8217;t read statutes. GHW Bush: Spy name leakers &#8220;most insidious of traitors.&#8221; If anybody thinks that Libby even POOPED without Cheney&#8217;s express permission, they&#8217;re completely out of their gourd. Now it&#8217;s time for Cheney to be impeached, censured, and jailed for TREASON. If not for this, then for selling Iran the centrifuges they are processing uranium with now. While Cheney was still CEO of Halliburton, and up until 2005 when they got caught, the company was engaged in backdoor deals through Dubai with Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions that had been in place since 1995. How about Rove - is he on the plane to Gitmo yet? Novak,Armitage, Card, Scooter and Rove, Chimpy and Shooter, need to be charged with treason. This was a high crime and we should see if some waterboarding might make them reveal bush as the chief Treasonist All the unhinged koolaid drinkers reich-wingers are still in denial of facts and the truth.. the spin: since no one was tried for treason, then that&#8217;s the &#8220;proof&#8221; that she wasn&#8217;t covert. Good old circular logic forever: no one brought her case to trial because she wasn&#8217;t covert. The proof that she wasn&#8217;t covert is the fact that a treason case wasn&#8217;t brought to trial. I am amazed that we continue to accept the convoluted logic of the Bush administration that tells lies and that demonizes anyone who refuses to believe them. Halliburton&#8217;s no bid contract Why is this administration still in office? Because those who should stand up and unmask the lies refuse to do so. Loyal and brave Americans are dying and being and being maimed while our nation looses credability in the rest of the world because thay see through the litany of lies. The greatest of which is that America needed to attack IRAQ for 9/11. It was Saudi Arabia that attacked America on 9/11, from there the slippery slope became a rollercoaster ride into our present quagmire. Bush, Chaney and their minions are so busy following up on their lies that they have little time for the truth or the real business of the American people. She wasn&#8217;t covert. You can&#8217;t believe her regarding her status, read today&#8217;s paper. They want to bring her back before congress to explain her three versions of who sent Joey to Niger. Why are we asking all of these people about her status - she worked for the CIA, they have records. There must be a paper giving her status at that time. Since it has not appeared and the Dems are in charge we must conclude that the paper states she was not covert. There was no intent. When the Novak story appeared it was clear that the White House was saying &#8221; how serious was this trip - his mommy sent him to Niger&#8221;. Wilson and Plame are lame (sorry). That is why they have moved far away. They have their money and now they want everything to fade away before they face any real scrutiny. Redner Doesn&#8217;t anyone remember that great Neo-con, Iraq War Supporter and supreme Bushista, Richard Armitage who has admitted leaking Palme&#8217;s name to Novak? He would do anything to further the wicked Cheney&#8217;s evil agenda. Give me a break. If Bush has a sense of humor he&#8217;ll pardon Libby, Sandy Berger and Bill Clinton at the same time. She was covert. She was covert. She was covert. There it is three more times for the deniers. They can now move on to foist another lie on the American people. Mosley What I find interesting is that the actual leaker was known to Fitzgerald almost from the beginning of the investigation and no charges were ever brought against him. This whole thing was stupid and funny, we should make it a comedy and make it a hit in Hollywood. I am speechless, what hope are there if we have these people working in our government to &#8216;lead&#8217; us, we all going down the cliff. Wu What I find interesting about this case is that the actual leaker was known to Fitzgerald almost from the beginning. Even before Libby made his mess. Charges were never even filed against him. Mrs. Wilson was covert, undoubtedly. Someone blew her cover during a time of war, which is treason. The traditional penalty of hanging must be applied to the guilty party. I don&#8217;t expect that that will happen until after 1/20/09 when democracy is restored, but it must happen eventually. Treason cannot be taken lightly. Stackhouse Amazing not one mention of the 9/11 commission&#8217;s findings on Joe Wilson&#8230; &#8220;The 9/11 report casts significant doubt over ALL of Wilson&#8217;s &#8220;findings&#8221; in Niger.&#8221; &#8220;Wilson admitted to the 9-11 Committee that he may have exaggerated. The 9-11 Committee found conclusively that Iraq was attempting to procure enriched (yellowcake) uranium in Africa.&#8221; But hey who cares about the truth here? Contributor Osborne (above) laments that &#8220;People are so deliberately untruthful to themselves.&#8221; More correctly, many people are intellectually dishonest and freely expose themselves to a disappointed public while hiding behind the anonymity of a user name. Such hidden &#8220;contributors&#8221; cannot be bested in argument and they cannot lose in debate, so there&#8217;s no point in trying to refute their nonsensical statements. My take? There was no valid reason for anyone in the administration to reveal the nature of Mrs. Wilson&#8217;s employment. Whose business is that? If folks were unhappy with his report from Niger, then they should have contested the report itself and not attacked Wilson or his wife. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t like the message, then kill the messenger&#8221; continues to be the administration&#8217;s principal rule of engagement. Lowenthal # 48. May 30th, 2007 Gives another perspective to the story, doesnât it? Kool-aid perspective. More Kool-aid to you ! And, how about: get a life ? Your own life. So you can worry about your own postpartum. CIA requested the inquiry of identity leak of CIA&#8217;s covert agent Valerie Plame Wilson. Numerous CIA agents worldwide were exposed since they were all using the same FAKE company name. And, their many contacts in many countries were outed as well, finished, ALL in one stroke. We were never told how many made safe trip home (or, not), or, how many of the non-US citizens/ CIA foreign informants were killed/ imprisoned, ceased to cooperate, etc. The rules of determination of agent status are quite elaborate and clear. Like dealing with IRS rules. Either the test is met, or not. Despite derenged and ancient Victoria Toensing&#8217;s Addams Family Anniversary Special for the Congress. Case closed. If this were a sane world, those responsible for &#8220;Outing&#8221; Valerie Plame would be waiting on execution for treason; the ignorant Fox news zombies still screaming &#8220;She&#8217;s not covert&#8221;, would be placed on an &#8220;ark&#8221; and shipped off to Iran to join other lunnietoon religeous fanatics; and Robert Novak would have been at least fired - never to be hired again as a journalist. But we don&#8217;t live in a sane world do we? No, we live in the bubble of nazi leaning fascist crazyness: Controlled by wealthy oil Bush regime sponsers who laughingly state &#8220;reality&#8221; for Americans is what THEY determine it to be, America&#8217;s daily media news flash must either be approved by America&#8217;s propaganda minister, Karl Rove - or censored. God help us&#8230; Staged Bush theatrics to foster phony patriatism? High government officials committing treason? Rigged elections? A media lieing to you in the face of fact WHILE DARING YOU TO SAY OTHERWISE? Is this the America our forefathers fought for? Is the only way left for Americans to get our constitution / country back, to be armed insurection? Load your weapons&#8230; Ready yourself. For the time is fast approaching. And this time, the revolution for democracy&#8217;s return will be led by veterans (as recent polls indicate). Tucker MARCH 7, 2003 â The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) â the international body that monitors nuclear proliferation â tells the UN Security Council that, after a âthorough analysisâ with âconcurrence of outside experts,â that the Italian documentsâ âwhich formed the basis for the reports of recent uranium transactions between Iraq and Nigerâare in fact NOT AUTHENTIC.â MARCH 19, 2003 â President Bush announces the START OF IRAQ WAR in a televised address, saying it is âto disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.â AUGUST 21, 2006-âThe main reason we went into Iraq, at the time, was WE THOUGHT HE HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. It TURNS OUT HE DIDN&#8217;T&#8221; Bush N if only more people would have these kinds of discussions and more politicians would listen to them. let&#8217;s move these discussions into a more public sphere where politicians can hear and respond. what kind of democracy is the us anyway? for all bush & co claim to love democracy, all they really care about is lining their pockets and those of their cronies, such as the oil companies. that&#8217;s what the war was about in the first place and the longer bush & co are allowed to get away with their blantant lies and illegal activities, the further they will undermine what they profess to love&#8211;democracy. #31: &#8220;Maybe people should be more concerned about Sandy Berger stealing and destroying classified docs that were supposed to go the 9/11 commission. AG&#8221; You are misinformed. He stole copies: But then you don&#8217;t care about facts. #48 Liz. No, it doesn&#8217;t mean a thing. Operatives in CIA don&#8217;t always have to be on duty. You are a Republican party apparatchik or so it sounds. Keep up the good work. It&#8217;s possible that you may yet ensure that the Republicans lose even more seats in the Senate, not just the Presidency. #57 Bill Redner. You are mistaken. The CIA asked for the investigation. I thought you conservatives believe in the rule of law? Or is it only sometimes? #64 pig: That&#8217;s a mischaraterization and you know it. traverse, by your logic, the NYT is certainly guilty of treason. Afterall, it exposed the entire CIA network used to fly terrorists to their new homes. Bottom line is that Wilson put his lies out there (as confirmed by the Senate) to make a bogus case. Plame drove herself to the office daily, traveled under her own name, hadn&#8217;t been living overseas in five years, got her husband an official assignment, whose results he not only lied about, but also leaked to major newspapers and then wrote his own lying editorial about it - and then she claimed she didn&#8217;t get him the job. Riiggghhhttt. Of course, she was so covert that she was listed in Who&#8217;s Who, but why let facts get in the way of the lefties personal truth&#8217;s? Sense I get so tired of listening to Bush haters spew ignorance about the infamous yellow cake. Niger was accused of agreeing to sell 500 tons of yellow cake to Iraq. Wilson claimed this wasn&#8217;t true bacause he flew down to Niger and asked the very people that stood to gain from the sale if they had done so. They said it wasn&#8217;t true. That is all he had in the way of evidence when he accused Bush of lying when he reported the sale base on British intel. What those that are quick to bash Bush obviously fail to remember, is the Yellow cake that was found at the nuclear research center of AlâTuwaitha in Iraq when American tanks rolled into Bagdhad during the first Gulf War. Care to guess how much was found? 500 tons!!! HMMM&#8230;where have we heard that figure before? Anyone want to guess where that 500 tons of yellow cake came from? Don&#8217;t ask Wilson as he obviously doesn&#8217;t have a clue!!!! You do know that in the OK, so I got it wrong vis-Ã -vis Clinton and the Constitution. Wasn&#8217;t the issue with him about lying under oath? Much the same as Libby, no? By the way, to all who corrected me, thank you. The vitriol wasn&#8217;t necessary. Or was it? di Grandpa The Wilson bashing would amaze me, if I wasn&#8217;t now used to seeing people who serve the USA get smeared by the right. Wilson spent over 10 years doing grunt work in africa and was #2 in our embassy iraq before GW1, where he became famous for facing down saddam and was called &#8216;a true american hero&#8217; by GHWB. It seems to me that if anyone said &#8216;get me an expert on both africa and iraq&#8217;, Wilson would be right at the top. However all we hear is &#8216;his wife sent him&#8217; and other smears. Wilson was perfectly qualified to find out about the yellowcake. AFAIK, all niger&#8217;s uranium was contracted to a french company, so it was not difficult to find if they had diverted 500 tons. The argument that Plame was not covert are ridiculous. I have no doubt of how the peoply saying that would react if a democrat had made a similar leak&#8230;.gitmo here we come. Now anyone who was associated with &#8216;brewster and jennings&#8217; is blown too, and people associated with them. keyes Plame was covert. What was done is treason. If a Democrat had done it, Republicans would be asking for the death penalty. There is no doubt. As reported regarding Valerie Plame&#8217;s covert employer: &#8220;Compounding the damage, the front company, Brewster-Jennings & Associates, the name of which has been reported previously, apparently also was used by other CIA officers whose work now could be at risk, according to Vince Cannistraro, former CIA chief of counterterrorism operations and analysis. Now, Plame&#8217;s career as a covert operations officer in the CIA&#8217;s Directorate of Operations is over. Those she dealt with &#8212; on business or not &#8212; may be in danger. The directorate is conducting an extensive damage assessment. And Plame&#8217;s exposure may make it harder for American spies to persuade foreigners to share important secrets with them, U.S. intelligence officials said.&#8221; Warren Strobel, &#8220;Leak of CIA Officers Leaves Trail of Damage&#8221;, Knight Ridder (Washington, D.C.), October 11, 2003, rpt. in Common Dreams NewsCenter, October 11, 2003. 71.

That certainly makes us more welcome and competitive in the world economy. I did travel to/did work in almost 50 countries, I know very well what is involved. I am also multilingual, operating in nearly 10 languages, so I usually get it from the original sources, withour the filter by Rovian Ministry of Truth you obviously rely on. You are one of the prime examples that anti-American parochial ignorance and arrogance of some least qualified Americans is well and alive. Common Sense - call yourself whatever self-congratulatory in the Week of Charity for Animals. You can confirm it&#8217;s allowed with Bill Falafel/Rush Limpdick, or the Faux news. If in doubt, mAnn Coulter or another reich-wingnut could help you to adjust. You can start baking cookies for Scooter&#8217;s prison packages - he&#8217;ll have lots of fun in prison w/ a name like that. Cookies can only add to his universal appeal, so get going. Should nothing else work, pull your head out, &#8220;common sense&#8221;, you are clearly suffering from oxygen starvation. This condition does not exempt you from service in Iraq, so get ready ! &#8220;Under the statutory definition, a &#8220;covert agent&#8221; under 50 U.S.C. 426(4)(A) includes someone: * Who is an employee of an intelligence agency, * Whose identity as an employee of the intelligence agency is classified, and * &#8220;Who is serving outside the United States or has with the last five years served outside the United States&#8221; An alternate definition of &#8220;covert agent&#8221; under 50 U.S.C. 426(4)(B) specifies someone who &#8220;resides and acts outside the United States.&#8221; You &#8220;reside&#8221; in the country where you have a permanent assignment, but you can &#8220;serve&#8221; the agency outside the United States in the manner described by Plame&#8217;s former C.I.A. colleague, Larry Johnson: &#8220;I can tell by virtue of how that [CIA from] company was set up. She was traveling overseas as a consultant in order to meet individuals who would have access, could be either agents of access, could be possible recruits to become spies for the United States in the area of about chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.&#8221; Testimony before the Senate Democratic Policy Committee on July 22, 2005 [PDF] In fact &#8220;serving outside the United States&#8221; can mean something very temporary. A grunt who spent two months in Tikrit &#8220;served&#8221; in Iraq. Condoleezza Rice travels to the Middle East in the service of the United States. If Plame traveled outside the U.S. for C.I.A business during the past five years, she was a &#8220;covert agent.&#8221; Case closed ! Keep in mind that many of the same people who refuse to believe that anyone in the Whitehouse would knowingly give up a CIA agent, also believe that the world was created in 6 days about 6000years ago. This in spite of overwhelming evidence that the earth is about a million times older than that. To many of these people logic and truth are just tools to be manipulated to suit an agenda. How they arive at their agenda I do not pretend to understand, but truth has nothing to do with it. I am not going to point fingers or call names. However, I deal in facts, not speculation or propaganda. I would like to see documents proving the following assertions (or at least news articles mentioning them, not blogs or opinion pieces): 1) Valerie Plame made three different assertions concerning who suggested her husband&#8217;s trip to Niger. I&#8217;ve been following this case from the beginning, and I&#8217;ve never heard that. 2) The 9/11 Commission Report cast significant doubts over all of Joe Wilson&#8217;s findings. Again, first time I&#8217;ve heard that. 3) 500 tons of yellow cake uranium were found in Iraq. I&#8217;m SURE I would have remembered that one if I had heard it before! To those who substitute vitriol for arguments, there is such a thing as &#8220;reasonable men may dif- fer,&#8221; so let us engage in and enjoy civil discourse Nick Hey Laura&#8230;try these facts #1 Valerie Plame testified at the Libby trial and again before congress that she had absolutely nothing to do with sending her husband to Niger. YETâ¦ According to page 39 of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on pre-war intelligence, July 2004, Wilson âwas selected for the 1999 trip after his wife mentioned to her supervisors that her husband was planning a business trip to Niger in the near future and might be willing to use his contacts in the region.â Or the declassified Carl Ford Jr. memo, (page 6) where it states&#8230;that Valerie actually convened the CIA meeting in which she discussed sending Joe to Niger. Both are a matter of record. Since you have followed this from the beginning I am not sure how you missed all this&#8230;maybe your source of news? Anyhow&#8230;there were multiple testimony by others during the Libby trial, including peers/coworkers that point to her testimony as being a lieâ¦and/or not the same as to what she had previously claimed or conflicted with what they personally knew as fact. #2 It wasnât the 9/11 report it was in the same intelligence report as above&#8230;page 73&#8230;it said for most analysts Wilsonâs trip to Niger âdidnât change any analystsâ assessments of the Iraq-Niger uranium dealâ and that his report âlent more credibility to the original CIA reports on the uranium dealâ. 3# I assume that was directed at my post.Google is a wonderful thing&#8230;try it &#8230;google &#8220;al Tuwaitha Iraq&#8221; under news&#8230;once again a matter of record. You donât remember Hans Blix ranting that looting of the facility presented a concern and that as occupiers we are responsible. I am surprised you were unaware of this as even the NYTâs carried the story, although their purpose in doing so was to try and minimize the repercussions of such a find&#8230;claiming it was of no real consequence. I just wish if you liberals are going to demand these senate investigations..the least you could do is read them. Hey Nick! Well said. Do I know you? Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that the left, liberal, Democrats, et. al. seem very angry and their comments often get ugly. Very counter-productive in my view. di Grandpa hey dan&#8230;try this fact. joe wilson was probably the best qualified person available to investigate a matter involving iraq and africa (and &#8216;a true american hero&#8217; according to GHWB) you look for dodgy motives to give someone a job when they&#8217;re not qualified, not when they&#8217;re the best&#8230;.unless the real aim is a smear. and, smearing is one thing the bush admin is competent at. case closed. keyes The (2 tons or so of) yellowcake (the rest of the 500 tons was natural Uranium) at Tuwaitha wasn&#8217;t in question here, we knew about that, which is why it was already under seal by the IAEA. The only scandal there is that the facility itself wasn&#8217;t secured, and *after* we went to war against Iraq, the seal was broken and it was looted by the native Iraqis. Now, almost all of the Uranium was found and recovered, although some of the Iraqis had dumped out the (useless, to them) Uranium and were using the barrels to store water (and subsequently got radiation sickness). But if you were worried about terrorists obtaining nuclear materials, then it seems you should have been more worried about us going to war in Iraq than about us not going to war in Iraq&#8211;at least before the war, the IAEA had a handle on things, but after the war, Iraq became one huge ammo dump free-for-all; good job there, buddy. With some four score entries on this blog regard- ing La Plame and her hubby, I suspect the truth lurks somewhere within. If only we could get some dispassionate mediator to plow through it all, ex- cise the name-calling and determine the facts! Of course, other factors are at play, like who will win the presidency and the congress in the next couple of years. Who will admit he was wrong? And so, Ol Al (would that be Del Nonno in Italian?) at least we can be said to try to keep the dis- course civil, regardless of the equities.

"Today Show" co-host Matt Lauer spoke with Romney. And, of course religion was the topic of conversation. Lauer: You started your morning and you were at an event and a guy you were walking up to shake his hand. Basically said and I am paraphrasing here 'I'm one of these people who is not going to vote for a Mormon for president.' Are you worried that it is still an issue in 2007? Romney: Not really. I really don't think it is. I know that there are always issues that some people will separate from me on. But I don't give it a lot of thought. I am focused on the vision I have for the future. And the majority of Americans couldn't care less about what kind of church I go to. They care about what kind of president I would be. Lauer: But a recent survey found that 38 percent of white evangelical Protestants say they would have serious doubts about voting for a Mormon. Are you going to have to defend this faith or should you just come out with a Kennedy moment and say look folks here is the deal. Here is my faith. Here is what it is about. Here is what I stand for. Romney: Well, there may be well opportunities to do that. But whether and where I do that is a different question than whether the American people think there should be a religious test applied to somebody who is running for office. Lauer: You don't think there will be? Romney: I don't think there will be. Utah Senator Bob Bennett agrees with Romney. He told the Deseret Morning News he doesn't think Romney's faith will interfere with the outcome of the race because many Republicans like Romney's "family values." Bennett said they also like Romney because Republicans want a candidate who can beat Hillary Clinton. Bennett believes Romney is that guy, but says if Fred Thompson joins the race all that could change. It looks like it might happen. Thompson says he will form an exploratory committee next week.

Giuliani, the Republican former New York City mayor, flew into California for a couple of fundraisers, but took time out to shake hands and promote his candidacy to diners in Burlingame's Broadway retail district. Edwards, the Democratic former North Carolina senator, spent his day farther south, talking to a Silicon Valley crowd of about 1,000 at Google's Mountain View headquarters. Edwards talked about high-tech issues and the war in Iraq, but Giuliani was on the attack, chastising Democratic candidates Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama as tax-raising liberals who would cripple the state's economy. Giuliani painted himself as the only Republican candidate who is moderate enough to win a state like California in November 2008. Giuliani's comments Wednesday outside Burlingame's Broadway Grill highlighted the political schizophrenia he faces, trying to appeal to the conservative Republicans needed to win the GOP nomination and the moderate independent, Democratic and GOP voters he must attract to have a chance at the presidency in the general election. Giuliani, who supports abortion rights and aggressively backed tougher firearm regulations in New York City, argued he is "the one Republican candidate who has a legitimate chance to win California'' -- a state dominated by Democrats. Giuliani said Republicans must be able to compete in other Democratic strongholds such as Connecticut, New York and Oregon if they intend to keep the White House in 2008. But the former mayor also gave the party's conservative wing a bow when he slammed Clinton, a New York senator, and Obama, a senator from Illinois, as free-spending backers of big government "who don't seem to really understand how the private economy works.'' Obama's call Tuesday for a national health care plan is expensive support for socialized medicine, Giuliani said, while Clinton's plan to eliminate President Bush's tax cuts for the richest Americans would result in huge tax increases that "would hurt our economy. It would hurt this area traumatically.'' "We are the party of lower taxes and less government,'' Giuliani said. "They are the party of higher taxes and more government.'' Edwards' visit to Google came as he seeks to distinguish his message in the Democratic contest largely dominated thus far by Clinton and Obama. He touched on his plans for providing more Internet access and other tech-friendly issues, but appeared more eager to cement his identity as the toughest anti-war candidate among the leading Democrats. "I voted for the war, and it was a huge mistake and it was wrong, and I have a responsibility for that ... I'll have to live with that,'' he said. "The way the war in Iraq has been conducted has been a catastrophe for America. ... "The Congress has the power to stop this war ... the question is, do they have the backbone to stop it,'' he said in a thinly veiled slap at Clinton, Obama and the other Democratic candidates now in Congress. Edwards argued that Democrats in the House and Senate should have continued to send Bush war spending legislation tied to troop withdrawals rather than giving in after the president's veto. "This is life and death -- literally. ... We have a moral responsibility to those men and women,'' he said. Edwards continued to apologize when he was asked why he ever voted to authorize the war in Iraq. "I made the decision ... I did think the evidence was overwhelming about weapons of mass destruction, and I decided to defer to the president of the United States ... (but) I shouldn't have done it.'' It wasn't all tough talk. Edwards laughed when one questioner, Tom Zhang, a Google technology recruiter, made a reference to recent headlines about the candidate's expensive haircuts, saying "I like your haircut.'' "I wondered if I could get through this without that,'' Edwards said wryly. E-mail the writers at This article appeared on page Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Champion Spellers Discuss Life After the Spelling Bee What are the chances that you'll win the Scripps National Spelling Bee and become an unemployed drug-addicted criminal? "From what we know," said Paige Kimble, the Bee's director and the 1981 champ, "not good." PHOTOS: Pained Faces, Braces at Bee In Shadow of Parents' Deportation, Boy Fails to Clear Bee Hurdle Spelling Reformers Picket Bee, Say 'Enuf is Enuf' National Spelling Bee Youngsters Advance Spellers Gear Up for National Spelling Bee 286 Contestants Start Spelling Bee Though Scripps, the media company that runs the Bee, does not track all its winners through life, "of those we know about, you'll see many are doctors, scientists, lawyers and writers," she said. "We have a sense and anecdotal evidence &#0133 [that] our winners generally become successful, though not necessarily famous." The winners on whom Scripps has kept tabs include a host of Ivy League graduates, physicians, business executives, a former NASA areospace engineer, a professor of pediatrics, and a 93-year-old electrical engineer who in 1925 took home his $500 prize in gold pieces. Several former champs have written books about spelling, comment for television about the Bee and work as Bee staffers. One young speller who has met with a certain modicum of fame is George Thampy. Now 19 and a soon-to-be sophomore at Harvard, Thampy was featured in "Spellbound," a documentary film that profiled eight competitors preparing and competing in the 1999 national Bee. "Spelling takes a lot of hard work," said Thampy, who plans to major in chemistry or English and has his eye on medical school. That hard work -- with its attendant lessons in persistence, discipline and dedication -- pays dividends later in life, he and other former spelling champs told ABC News in the lead up to the 80th Scripps National Spelling Bee finals to be aired on ABC tomorrow night. Though he came up short in 1999, during his second trip to the finals, he bested competitors from across the country and around the English-speaking world the following year. His winning word in 2000 was "demarche," which means a formal protest, usually issued by a diplomat. In "Spellbound," Thampy comes off as a precocious 11-year-old dedicated to his studies and devout in his religion. A first- generation American, and the son of Indian immigrants, Thampy said he lost three times at local competitions and twice at the nationals before winning in 2000. Thampy remains aspirational; he has set his eyes on new heights and turned a work ethic honed in the crucible of competitive spelling toward other pursuits. "I am constantly striving, never looking back and never looking down. There are always new mountains to climb. The ones you have scaled are dwarfed by the ones above you. I don't look back at the old mountain, but I realize I have the skills and tools to move forward," Thampy said from the sidelines of this year's Bee. How Do You Spell Success?

Lauer and Romney were seated in the moving SUV during the interview. After the piece aired this morning, Lauer told his audience that even though New Hampshire doesn't have a mandatory seat belt law, he set the wrong example by not wearing one. He noted a recent interview he conducted with New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, who was nearly killed in a car crash while not wearing a seat belt. The Romney campaign issued a statement with a similar apology, admitting that he sometimes forgets to wear a seat belt and needs to remind himself to always buckle up.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Correction to This Article An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated that I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby was convicted in February. He was convicted in March. Fitzgerald Again Points to Cheney Tuesday, May 29, 2007; 1:14 PM Special counsel Patrick J. Fitzgerald has made it clearer than ever that he was hot on the trail of a coordinated campaign to out CIA agent Valerie Plame until that line of investigation was cut off by the repeated lies from Vice President Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby. Libby was convicted in March of perjury and obstruction of justice. Fitzgerald filed a memo on Friday asking U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton, who will sentence Libby next week, to put him in prison for at least two and a half years.

More White House Links Yahoo News Full Coverage Latest Job Approval Polls White House Web Site White House Press Releases White House Press Briefings Live White House Video Feed Global Message of the Day Save & Share Article Despite all the public interest in the case, Fitzgerald has repeatedly asserted that grand-jury secrecy rules prohibit him from being more forthcoming about either the course of his investigation or any findings beyond those he disclosed to make the case against Libby. But when his motives have been attacked during court proceedings, Fitzgerald has occasionally shown flashes of anger -- and has hinted that he and his investigative team suspected more malfeasance at higher levels of government than they were able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. In Friday's eminently readable , Fitzgerald quotes the Libby defense calling his prosecution "unwarranted, unjust, and motivated by politics." In responding to that charge, the special counsel evidently felt obliged to put Libby's crime in context. And that context is Dick Cheney. Libby's lies, Fitzgerald wrote, "made impossible an accurate evaluation of the role that Mr. Libby and those with whom he worked played in the disclosure of information regarding Ms. Wilson's CIA employment and about the motivations for their actions." It was established at trial that it was Cheney himself who first told Libby about Plame's identity as a CIA agent, in the course of complaining about criticisms of the administration's run-up to war leveled by her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson. And, as Fitzgerald notes: "The evidence at trial further established that when the investigation began, Mr. Libby kept the Vice President apprised of his shifting accounts of how he claimed to have learned about Ms. Wilson's CIA employment." The investigation, Fitzgerald writes, "was necessary to determine whether there was concerted action by any combination of the officials known to have disclosed the information about Ms. Plame to the media as anonymous sources, and also whether any of those who were involved acted at the direction of others. This was particularly important in light of Mr. Libby's statement to the FBI that he may have discussed Ms. Wilson's employment with reporters at the specific direction of the Vice President Not clear on the concept yet? Fitzgerald adds: "To accept the argument that Mr. Libby's prosecution is the inappropriate product of an investigation that should have been closed at an early stage, one must accept the proposition that the investigation should have been closed after at least three high-ranking government officials were identified as having disclosed to reporters classified information about covert agent Valerie Wilson, where the account of one of them was directly contradicted by other witnesses, where there was reason to believe that some of the relevant activity may have been coordinated, and where there was an indication from Mr. Libby himself that his disclosures to the press may have been personally sanctioned by the Vice President Up until now, Fitzgerald's most singeing attack on Cheney came during closing arguments at the Libby trial in February. Libby's lawyers had complained that Fitzgerald was trying to put a "cloud" over Cheney without evidence to back it up -- and that set Fitzgerald off. As I wrote in my , the special counsel responded with fire: "There is a cloud over what the Vice President did that week. . . . He had those meetings. He sent Libby off to [meet then-New York Times reporter] Judith Miller at the St. Regis Hotel. At that meeting, the two-hour meeting, the defendant talked about the wife. We didn't put that cloud there. That cloud remains because the defendant has obstructed justice and lied about what happened. . . . "That's not something that we put there. That cloud is something that we just can't pretend isn't there." To those of us watching the investigation and trial unfold, Cheney's presence behind the scenes has emerged in glimpses and hints.

Earlier, CBS News reported National Weather Service forecasters believed that 3 to 5 of the storms will be Category 3 or higher. Gray, based at Colorado State University, described it as a very active season. He said there was a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall somewhere on the U.S. coast. There is a 50 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the East Coast, including the Florida Peninsula, according to the new forecast; the long-term average is 31 percent. The chance of a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast between the Florida Panhandle and Brownsville, Texas, is 49 percent; the long-term average is 30 percent. There is also an above-average chance of a major hurricane making landfall in the Caribbean, according to the forecast. Thursday's forecast was largely unchanged from Gray's last forecast, released in early April. "We expect an above-average hurricane season," said Phil Klotzbach, a member of Gray's team and lead author of the forecast. The hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, averages 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year. There were 10 named Atlantic storms last year and five hurricanes, two of them major. None of the hurricanes hit the U.S. Atlantic coast. The devastating 2005 season set a record with 28 named storms, 15 of them hurricanes. Four hurricanes hit the U.S. coast, the worst among them Katrina, which devastated parts of the Gulf Coast.

This Week in Weddings Wedding of the Week Planning Ideas & Advice Jury Selection Underway In Seale Trial Jury Selection Begins in Seale Trial Jury selection began Wednesday in the trial of reputed Klansman James Ford Seale. The 71 year old is accused of kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1964 murders of two black teenagers in Franklin County. Its been nearly half a century since 19 year olds Henry Dee and Charles Moore were abducted, beaten, and dumped in the Mississippi River. Several of their siblings traveled from across the country to see James Ford Seale tried in their murders. "It took a lot out of us already," said Henry Dee&#39;s older sister, Thelma Collins. "Sometimes you&#39;ll get to thinking about it and you&#39;ll shed tears every now and then." "This crime has caused me to have bad dreams, nightmares, lost my whole family," said Thomas Moore, Charles Moore&#39;s brother. Seale has been in jail since his arrest in January. Instead of an orange jumpsuit, he appeared in court Wednesday in khakis and a blue button down. Seeing him was painful for Dee&#39;s sisters. "It hurt," said Collins. "I&#39;m not going to say it didn&#39;t hurt." A group of 76 potential jurors was narrowed down to 55 Wednesday. That is out of a larger group of 300 who were summoned from 45 counties in the Southern portion of the state. Jurors&#39; names will be kept secret, because the case involves Klan activities. It could be a lengthy trial, but one that&#39;s worth the wait for the victims&#39; families. "This is what the whole system is about," said Moore. "Justice. It&#39;s about the right people and the right time doing the right thing." Jury selection continues at 9AM Thursday in Judge Henry Wingate&#39;s courtroom. The judge instructed the potential jurors not to read or watch any news. During questioning Wednesday, one potential juror mentioned Seale by name. So the group now knows that it&#39;s this high profile case they may be deciding. All content &copy; Copyright 2001 - 2007 WorldNow and WLBT, a All Rights Reserved.

The fees that immigrants pay to request "green cards" will nearly triple to $930. The cost of renewing working permits jumps 89 percent to $340. And applying for citizenship will cost $595, an increase of $265. Some children will pay less and immigrants who fall under the federal poverty line can apply for waivers, but most others will have to cough up more cash. Immigration officials, who have hired staff and reallocated resources during the past year to reduce a years-long backlog to about six months, say the increases are necessary because the agency is solely funded by user fees. The increases will raise more than $2 billion, according to immigration officials. But immigrants and their advocates complain that these costs are excessive for people who often are struggling to settle here while helping relatives in their homelands. Under Secretary Emilio Gonzalez, head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, unveiled the fee revisions in January, as the first major overhaul of immigration costs since 1998. The fees will become final after a public-comment period. Gonzalez said in a written statement that the new fees are "both fair to our customers and vital to our Nation as we continue to build a secure and efficient national immigration service." But some say the costs make citizenship less affordable. "This is ridiculous," said Gail Seeram, an Orlando immigration attorney who files applications for many West Indian clients in Central Florida. "These aren't filing fees. These are penalties. . . . If you examine any other government fee structure in the U.S., there is none with such unrealistic set of fees." Since higher fees were proposed earlier this year, many who qualified for citizenship but had not yet requested it rushed to submit their petitions. A recent Orlando Sentinel analysis of filings during the past few months showed that immigrants have filed citizenship applications in record numbers. At least 118,600 immigrants across the country requested citizenship in March, compared with about 74,200 in March 2006. In Florida, the number of citizenship applications was about 31,000 in the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 62 percent over the previous year. Applications for green cards, the documents that entitle immigrants to live and work here legally, also increased in Florida and the U.S. Miriam Vazquez, 37, a Dominican immigrant who works in a factory in east Orlando, was filling out her citizenship application Tuesday because she had heard buzz about the fee increase. Vazquez said that even at the current cost of about $400 for a citizenship application with fingerprinting and photos, she had to save for weeks to scrape the money together. "With the minimum wage we make in this state, it's too little money to pay for all that," Vazquez said. "I am trying to rush and do it now, because it's going to cost more." Richard Logue, who directs the Catholic Immigration and Refugee Services program of Catholic Charities in Orlando, said his office has seen more inquiries from immigrants. Especially burdened, he said, are those who need to file "adjustment of status" forms to request green cards. Those applications will go from $325 to $930, a 186 percent increase. Many who file that application also need to request a work permit, which will jump from $180 to $340 every year. Waivers of those fees, Logue said, are usually difficult to obtain for most immigrants. "Families had a difficult time coming up with the old fees in our experience," Logue said, "so some working-class families will perhaps have to forgo getting their papers and citizenship." Anne Yamasaki, 72, a German immigrant in Rockledge, is dependent on Social Security. She says she can't spare the extra $100 her green-card renewal will cost next year. She won't even think about applying for citizenship, even though she has lived in the U.S. for more than 40 years, because of the cost. But she also wants to see more-efficient service than she did during her last visit to the immigration office in south Orlando. "I live on a very limited income," Yamasaki said. "But it might be worth it, because last time I went to immigration I was standing in a little alleyway for hours." President Bush defends immigration reform.

USA TODAY On Politics Run also a race for campaign funds By Fredreka Schouten, USA TODAY WASHINGTON &#151; Fred Thompson's nascent presidential campaign already has the backing of Tennessee Republicans who have long track records collecting money for White House contenders. The former senator, however, will have to move quickly to expand his support to catch up to his leading GOP rivals, in a race where several candidates are expected to raise as much as $100 million before the 2008 primaries. On Tuesday, Thompson made an appeal to 100 supporters, asking them to each raise $46,000. "Fred Thompson is a seasoned politician with a strong network of friends and supporters," said Lewis Eisenberg, a former Republican National Committee finance chairman. Given the shortened primary season, however, "time is running out," he said. For his presidential race, Thompson can draw on his years as a lawyer and lobbyist. Lawyers and law firm employees were the biggest contributors to Thompson's two Senate campaigns and to his political action committee, giving more than $570,000 since 1993, according to campaign-finance data tallied by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics. Trial lawyers have proved a rich vein of political donations for Democratic contenders, but Thompson's past opposition to some federal efforts to limit lawsuits also makes him appealing to this group, said Linda Lipsen, senior vice president of public affairs at the American Association for Justice, which represents trial lawyers. In 2002, for instance, Thompson voted against limiting medical malpractice lawsuits. Thompson's acting roles &#8212; including as the fictional District Attorney Arthur Branch on NBC's &#8212; also give him access to another source of campaign money: Hollywood. People in the television, movie and music business have contributed more than $160,000 to Thompson, the center's data show. These donors include actor and writer Ben Stein, who gave $1,000 to Thompson in 1998. Stein did not return telephone messages. By waiting until now to voice his White House intentions, Thompson lost the support of one of the GOP's top fundraisers, Ted Welch. The Nashville-based investor is aiding Mitt Romney, who leads the Republican field in fundraising. Romney raised nearly $21 million in the first three months of this year, and has collected more from Tennesseans than anyother presidential contender in either party, according to his campaign-finance reports. "A lot of high-powered people have called me about supporting Fred," said Welch, who chose Romney after another former Tennessee senator, Bill Frist, opted not to run. Welch isn't budging. "If you commit to somebody, you're committed," he said. James Haslam II &#8212; who, like Welch, is a major fundraiser for President Bush and a Tennessean &#8212; predicted Thompson could sway uncommitted people. "I think there's still money there to be raised," he said. Thompson's plans for extensive Internet outreach give him the potential to move beyond the traditional GOP fundraising base, online experts say. "He has more of an Internet presence than any announced candidate," said David All, a GOP online strategist. "There's a heck of a lot more donors who can give $5 or $10 on the Internet than those who can give $2,300." Thompson supporters said they are confident about his ability to raise money. "Fred Thompson is running second and third place in polls, and he hasn't spent a nickel," spokesman Mark Corallo said. "There are a couple of campaigns that have raised an enormous amount of money and have spent an enormous amount of money, and it hasn't done anything for them."

Jon Corzine about the governor's near-fatal car crash while riding without wearing a safety belt. A few weeks after that chat, there was Lauer on "Today" on Wednesday, sitting in the back of a moving sport utility vehicle while interviewing Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney. Both men were unbuckled. A sheepish Lauer admitted his mistake after "Today" ran the interview, which was conducted Tuesday. "I should have set a better example," he said. Romney also said he needs to keep reminding himself to buckle up. Corzine was riding in a State Police-driven SUV that crashed going 91 mph on April 12 along the Garden State Parkway. Corzine, unbuckled in the front passenger seat, broke his leg, 11 ribs, collarbone and sternum. He voluntarily paid a $46 fine and apologized to the state. He also released a public service announcement urging people to wear seat belts. "Today" show producers noticed the oversight before the segment with Romney aired and decided to have Lauer address it, executive producer Jim Bell said. Viewers certainly noticed. "Today" got more than 100 e-mails about Lauer and Romney's oversights while the segment was being telecast, Bell said. "It was amazing," he said.

Guards at the U.S. Naval Base in southeast Cuba found the detainee in his cell unresponsive and not breathing Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a statement. "They tried to save his life but he was pronounced dead," said Mario Alvarez, a Miami-based spokesman for the command. It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. On June 10, 2006, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets. Details, including the prisoner's name and manner of death, were not released. A spokesman for detention operations, Navy Cmdr. Rick Haupt, declined to comment, referring questions to the Miami-based Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Caribbean and Latin America. The death came as the U.S. military prepared to try two detainees - Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni, and Omar Khadr, a Canadian who was 15 when he was captured in a firefight with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Their arraignment is scheduled to proceed on Monday at Guantanamo as planned, Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon, a Pentagon spokesman, said late Wednesday. Khadr on Wednesday fired his American attorneys, leaving him without defense counsel as his arraignment approaches, his former U.S. military attorney said. "He doesn't trust American lawyers, and I don't particularly blame him," said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who was taken off the case Wednesday. "The United States is responsible for his interrogation and his treatment under a process that is patently unfair." The military toughened security at the prison camp following the previous suicides and an uprising last spring, taking measures to remove access to light fixtures and other possible makeshift weapons. About 380 men are held at the isolated prison camp on suspicion of links to al-Qaida or the Taliban. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is conducting an ongoing investigation into the three previous suicides. A cultural adviser was helping the military handle the remains. "The remains of the deceased detainee are being treated with the utmost respect," the military said. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

Fred Thompson plans to begin formally "testing the waters" for a Republican presidential run receives heavy coverage, with all three networks covering it -- two in depth -- and most major national newspapers putting the story on the front page. Coverage is generally sympathetic toward the new candidate, noting his Hollywood fame and his appeal to conservatives in the unsettled GOP race. Many reports mention Thompson's desire to evoke thoughts of an earlier actor-politician, Ronald Reagan. However, some stories have an undercurrent of doubt about, in ABC's words, Thompson's "lack of legislative accomplishments" during his Senate tenure. reported, "Ten Republicans are already running. How about number 11?" Thompson "lawyer, actor, former senator -- will file papers Monday to begin raising money, the first step toward candidacy. Thompson is expected to announce as early as the Fourth of July." ABC, noting his Hollywood career, added, "But playing a president is a lot easier than being one." In a 2,000-word front-page story, says Thompson "has been coy with audiences as he flirts with a bid," but in an interview with the newspaper, he "makes it clear that he plans to run, he describes how he aims to do it. He's planning a campaign that will use blogs, video posts and other Internet innovations to reach voters repelled by politics-as-usual in both parties." In his column, Robert Novak says Thompson suggested at a Tuesday dinner with "20 fellow conservatives, mostly journalists," that "his candidacy will be different from other Republicans, in both substance and style." Thompson "envisions a 21st-century campaign, using the Internet more and spending less than his opponents." , also on its front page, says Thompson's backers "hope his name recognition as an actor and radio commentator, conservative stands on issues like immigration and government spending, and strength in the South will differentiate him from the current crop of candidates." Under the perhaps inevitable headline "Thompson Prepares For Biggest Role Yet," the also says that as a "plain-spoken southern Republican with a solidly conservative voting record," Thompson "would hope to become the consensus candidate the party is so far lacking." says Thompson will position himself "as a down-home antidote to Washington politics" and will run his "campaign out of Nashville while promising leadership on a conservative agenda that will appeal to his party's base." The Post says his entry will add "a fourth candidate to the field's top tier," since Giuliani, McCain, and Romney "have struggled to win the confidence of conservative Republicans." But GOP strategists "cautioned that Thompson will need a more refined message and an error-free start to live up to the publicity surrounding his all-but-certain candidacy." The New Hampshire Union Leader also says "polls indicate he would start in the first tier of candidates." says Thompson "has been keeping a high profile in conservative circles and preparing behind the scenes to start a campaign. He has gathered a cadre of senior advisors that includes" former RNC political director Ken Rietz and former Federal Election Commission chairman Michael Toner. says Thompson "will have to move quickly to expand his support to catch up to his leading GOP rivals, in a race where several candidates are expected to raise as much as $100 million before the 2008 primaries." Effect On GOP Top-Tier Candidates Remains Unclear focused on "how this affects the already crowded field." NBC (Russert): "The Fred Thompson campaign senses an unease among the top Republican contenders amongst the conservative base, and that Thompson will try to cast himself as a consistent conservative and try to fill that vacuum." Giuliani's campaign "expects their candidate will take a hit initially in the polls that some of their supporters who gravitated Giuliani will go to Thompson, feeling more comfortable with his conservative credentials, but it will also unsettle the race. If you talk to the Mitt Romney people, it says he'll hurt John McCain because he supported John McCain in 2000. And they have to raise money from similar places. McCain says, no that's not the case, he'll hurt Romney, because Romney had got some momentum, particularly in Iowa, and this now shakes up the race and makes Romney look less conservative than Fred Thompson." says Thompson "is likely to cut into support for a prominent real-life ex-prosecutor, Rudolph Giuliani." While some analysts said Romney "has the most to lose if Thompson can pick up the conservative voters Romney is banking on," Giuliani "would suffer too if conservatives rally to Thompson's side and see in him what they have seen in the ex-mayor -- an electable candidate with the aura of celebrity." However, Giuliani backer Rep. Peter King said he "believes voters will see the difference between real life and TV when they are looking for a strong leader." King said, "Rudy had 9/11, and Fred Thompson had 'Law & Order.'" Thompson Likely To Be On Ames Straw Poll Ballot reports Thompson will probably be on Iowa's August 11 Ames straw poll ballot "whether he wants to be or not." While "some Thompson advisers are urging him not to contest the straw poll," the event "is run by the Iowa Republican Party, and the party's members, not the candidates, decide which contenders are listed." Obama, Romney Focus On Foreign Policy reports Sen. Barack Obama and Mitt Romney "outline their respective foreign policy visions in lengthy articles in the next issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, offering sharp contrasts on issues including the war in Iraq and climate change." Obama "calls the Bush administration's Iraq policies 'tragically misguided' and advocates a phased withdrawal of U.S. combat forces, to be completed by next March," while Romney "notes that there is 'no guarantee' that the administration's current strategy will succeed but says that 'the stakes are too high and the potential fallout too great to deny our military leaders and troops on the ground the resources and the time needed to give it an opportunity.'"

Hillary Clinton responded to the lawsuit brought by shareholders of InfoUSA against chief executive Vinod Gupta for allowing Clinton to travel aboard company planes by saying "that she followed all Senate rules" and that her acceptance of this travel did not negate her criticisms of "corporate America's largesse and skyrocketing executive pay." Calling Gupta a "longtime benefactor," the AP notes that "Clinton's campaign has said she reimbursed Gupta at the cost of a first-class flight, typically a significant discount off the expense of a private jet." Brownback Expands On Evolution Views op-ed called "What I Think About Evolution," Sen. Sam Brownback writes, "I suppose I should not have been surprised earlier this month when, during the first Republican presidential debate, the candidates on stage were asked to raise their hands if they did not 'believe' in evolution. As one of those who raised his hand, I think it would be helpful to discuss the issue in a bit more detail and with the seriousness it demands. The premise behind the question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly assert belief in evolution, then one must necessarily believe that God created the world and everything in it in six 24-hour days. But limiting this question to a stark choice between evolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity of the interaction between science, faith and reason." Tancredo Has "Cult Following" profiles "Rep. Tom Tancredo: A Lightning Rod On Immigration." The Tribune says Tancredo's "crusade to have every illegal immigrant in the country deported and to make English the country's official language has inspired a cult following for this grandson of Italian immigrants, attracting white supremacists and PTA moms alike." While his presidential bid "is widely regarded as a long shot, the reaction he has received so far in Iowa shows his campaign can't be entirely dismissed, political analysts say." FEC: Kerry Violated Spending Limits reports a Federal Election Commission draft audit says Sen. John Kerry's publicly funded 2004 presidential campaign "broke spending limits by nearly $1.4 million during his 2004 presidential bid, including some funds spent on customizing his campaign jets." The FEC "could rule that Kerry's campaign must reimburse the government." says Kerry-Edwards lawyer Marc Elias "says the campaign stayed within the limits and accused the commission's auditors of taking 'an unsupportably aggressive view of the law.'" to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Bush Sees Korea When He Looks At Iraq The White House on Wednesday offered the US military mission in South Korea as a model for its role in Iraq. The suggestion drew skeptical treatment from the media, as well as renewed questions about the success of the Iraq troop "surge." The reports White House press secretary Tony Snow "told reporters that" President Bush "believes US forces eventually will end their combat role in Iraq but will continue to be needed in the country to deter threats and to help handle potential crises, as they have done in South Korea." The reports the comparison between Iraq and South Korea "was offered as the Pentagon announced the completion of the troop buildup ordered by Bush in January. The last of about 21,500 combat troops to arrive were an Army brigade in Baghdad and a Marine unit heading into the Anbar province in western Iraq." runs a brief report on Snow's comments under the headline "Bush Sees Troops In Iraq For 'Long Time,'" while the portrays the new "model" as a consequence of the possible failure of the current "surge." A "resurgence of sectarian violence and attacks on US troops, coupled with little to no progress on crucial Iraqi political goals, is already spurring discussion about whether the current strategy can succeed." David Broder, in a column titled "Endgame Ahead," writes in the that "the end is coming into view -- not soon enough to spare every precious life, but sooner than President Bush and Vice President Cheney may wish. The dynamic in Congress has been set in motion that will bring this war to an end -- or at least reduce the scale of American involvement and redefine the mission of U.S. troops." Petraeus: Iraqis Must Take Opportunity interviewed Gen, David Petraeus, who said, "Everyone is impatient, including the Iraqi leaders. And what we have to see, now, is, in fact, whether they can make the most of this opportunity that our soldiers and their soldiers are fighting and dying to give to them." Maliki Warns Of Iraqi Army Coup Schemes interviewed Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, who said, "I have to watch the army because those still loyal to the previous regime may start planning coups. Those people don't believe in democracy and for that reason we are monitoring the status of the army very carefully." Bush Team Considers New Media Outreach Current and former Bush administration communications officials tell the US News Political Bulletin that they now believe they relied too heavily on traditional media and the White House press corps to get out the President's message about the broader war on terrorism and the booming economy. "We didn't use the new tools of communication" like the Internet, blogs and mobile technology, said a former key official. As a result, added another official, the President's message was filtered through the mainstream press which eventually got bored with the story and stopped reporting the President's repetitive messages. "You've got to use the new tools. They can reach far more people than TV or the papers," said an administration official. "A video on the Internet or some blogging can reach millions and we should have played with that much more," said the official. White House insiders, however, dismissed the complaints, mostly from former communications officials, claiming that they have worked with bloggers and non-traditional media but that the tide has turned against them. The White House lessons are being played out on the 2008 presidential campaign where several former Bush aides are working for GOP candidates who are relying more on Internet and blog-based communications than the traditional TV ads and national press corps. "We've got to learn to communicate in a different way," said an advisor to likely GOP candidate Fred Thompson. DOJ Probe: The Plot Thickens After Monica Goodling, a former Justice Department aide, testified last week that she "crossed the line" by using political affiliation as a criteria for hiring decisions, the DOJ inspector general and other ethics officials have expanded their investigation. reports Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine and Counsel Marshall Jarrett of the Office of Professional Responsibility, "which investigates misconduct within the agency, sent a letter to Congress on Wednesday saying they are also looking into the program for hiring entry-level lawyers and summer interns." The says the "expanded investigation also appears to reflect concerns among a growing number of career employees at the Justice Department who have suggested that politics have compromised the hiring process at the department during the Bush administration." And the says the "widening inquiry is likely to pose an additional challenge for Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales." While the US attorney "dismissals have prompted wide political criticism, improper hiring practices could be deemed a violation of the law." reports it "couldn't be determined whether the Goodling inquiry will be expanded to include what direction she received from higher-ups within the department or the White House. The announcement Wednesday, however, indicated that the internal inquiry is looking more broadly at charges of politicization across the department." The runs a similar report. Pattern Seen In Minnesota Case reports that by the time Minnesota US Attorney Tom Heffelfinger "resigned last year, his office had collected a string of awards and commendations from the Justice Department. So it came as a surprise -- and something of a mystery -- when he turned up on a list of U.S. attorneys who had been targeted for firing." But "part of the reason, government documents and other evidence suggest, is that he tried to protect voting rights for Native Americans." to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Bush AIDS Proposal Widely Praised In what has become a rare occurrence, a proposal by President Bush yesterday is earning praise from almost all corners. reported Bush "says he wants to double America's commitment to fighting AIDS in Africa." Bush is asking Congress "to authorize an additional $30 billion for his AIDS program over a period of five years." called Bush's proposed funding increase "dramatic." Under the headline "Bush AIDS Plan Gets Bipartisan Praise," the says Bush's proposal "was met yesterday with broad support uncommon in Washington. International aid organizations, advocacy groups and members of Congress from both parties offered praise for the proposal -- even if some argued that the proposed increase is insufficient." The notes Bush also "announced that his wife, Laura, will visit four African countries -- Zambia, Mali, Mozambique and Senegal -- that have benefited from the U.S. program and report back to him on her findings. The trip will take place June 25-29." says Bush's proposal "comes a week before he and other leaders will discuss AIDS and Africa at the Group of Eight summit of leading industrialized nations." Among the few who criticized Bush plan, says the , was Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, who "said the government should also boost spending on malaria and tuberculosis, and on related efforts that are not part of the program but could bolster the fight against HIV/AIDS, including education, nutrition, water, food security and healthcare workers." Praising Bush's announcement, meanwhile, was Bono. reports "the Grammy-winning rock star sang Bush's praises Wednesday" in a phone interview from Morocco. reports White House counselor Dan Bartlett "said the president was convinced America's image in the world would improve because" of initiatives like this one. Jenna Bush's Book On AIDS-Stricken Girl reports in its "Reliable Source" column that Bush twin Jenna "completes her transformation from party girl to global activist this weekend when she starts the promotional rounds for her book, 'Ana's Story: A Journey of Hope.'" Bush, 25, will "appear Saturday at N.Y.C.'s BookExpo America, meeting with booksellers to spike sales and generate buzz." A "peek at the 296-page advance manuscript shows a strong narrative as Bush traces the life of a 17-year-old Panamanian girl living with HIV-AIDS." Pay Discrimination Ruling Under Fire In the wake of the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to limit employees' ability to sue for pay discrimination, the says congressional Democrats have pledged to reverse the outcome of the case through legislation. The decision is also generating significant media criticism, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's outspoken dissent drawing positive media coverage. The reports that both in "the abortion case the court decided last month and the discrimination ruling it issued on Tuesday," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg "read forceful dissents from the bench." Ginsburg "may have concluded that quiet collegiality has proved futile and that her new colleagues, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., are not open to persuasion on the issues that matter most to her." says in an editorial, "The Supreme Court struck a blow for discrimination this week by stripping a key civil rights law of much of its potency. ... Fortunately, Congress can amend the law to undo this damaging decision. It should do so without delay." The writes "Ginsburg is clearly right on the policy: It's impossible for every victim of pay discrimination to know and take action within 180 days. Congress should adjust the law accordingly." And the editorializes that Ginsburg "attempted to call the court's attention to those real-world facts." Congress is "left to act because the Supreme Court has read the law so rigidly that it has misread life." to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. The Latest From Late Night Comedians The late-night political shows were reruns last night. to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Copyright &copy; 2007 by the Bulletin News Network, Inc. 7915 Jones Branch, Suite 6200 &bull; McLean, VA 22102 every weekday at 8 a.m. BEST CAREERS 2007 &raquo; Here's where &#151; and where not &#151; to look if you're considering a fresh career start in 2007.

http://www.newszap.com/articles/2007/05/30/fl/lake_okeechobee/aok04.txt&cid Published: May 30, 2007 - 07:31:44 pm EDT Area is now under tighter water limits By Pete Gawda, Okeechobee News On Wednesday, May 30, Lake Okeechobee tied the record low of 8.97 feet. This low has exposed many areas of the lake bottom; allowing water mangers to scrape muck from the dry lake bottom and haul it off. Here the muck from around the pier at Jaycees Park is being scraped up and hauled off. It is being spreading on public and privately owned properties. The near-record low level of Lake Okeechobee has forced tighter water restrictions in the areas around the lake. History was made on Wednesday, May 30, when Lake Okeechobee matched its previous all time recorded low of 8.97 feet. That low prompted South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) to impose Phase III water restrictions for the area around Lake Okeechobee including the Okeechobee area. Mandatory Phase III water use restrictions are now in effect for parts of Hendry, Glades, Okeechobee, Lee, Martin, St. Lucie and Palm Beach counties - roughly the area encircling Lake Okeechobee and along the Caloosahatchee Rivers. This includes utility customers in South Bay, Belle Glade, Pahokee, Okeechobee and Clewiston. Agriculture users in this area are required to reduce water use by 45 percent. Residential users must restrict lawn watering, boat and car washing to one day per week. People with odd numbered addresses can water their lawns on Saturdays from 4 until 8 a.m. Those with even numbered addresses can water on Sundays between 4 and 8 a.m. These restrictions do not apply to people who use a well. Officials with SFWMD urge people to use every means possible to conserve water even as we enter what is traditionally the rainy season. "In response to the rapid drop in Lake Okeechobee's water level, we are continuing to make the necessary decisions to help stretch water supplies," said Carol Ann Wehle, SFWMD executive director. "Tighter restrictions on the use of lake-connected surface water is one way to help us better manage the regional system." On Wednesday, the lake level continued its fall of over a year as it dropped to 8.97 feet above sea level tying the record low reached May 24, 2001. That measurement was derived from the average of four gauges scattered around the lake. One of the gauges is located in the northern area of the lake near Okeechobee. One is located on the west side of the lake west of Fisheating Creek. A third gauge is in the center of the lake, while the fourth is at the southern end of the lake near Pahokee. John Hayford, executive director of Okeechobee Utility Authority (OUA), said the utility has not experienced any problem yet with their water intake. He was guessing that the intake would be good for at least another 12-inch drop in lake levels. However, he noted that was just a guess since they are operating under unfamiliar conditions. The utility has a backup plan if their lake intake becomes unusable. A temporary rented pump has been installed on the Rim Canal. In about two months it will be replaced by a permanent pump to provide emergency water supplies in time of drought or hurricanes. The lake level is 3 feet below average for this time of year. However, the plummeting lake levels have at least one positive quality. The drought has exposed large areas of lake bottom. This allows water managers to scrape up accumulated muck from the now dry lake bottom and haul it off. "While the record level of Lake Okeechobee means that drought conditions are continuing, seizing this opportunity to clean the bottom of the lake now will ensure a healthier lake when the rains return," said Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Michael W. Sole. Work is currently going on at South Bay, Fisheating Creek, Harney Pond, Horse Island, the northwest marsh near Buckhead Ridge and Eagle Bay. Muck removed from these areas is being hauled to inland sites. The work going on around the pier at Jaycees Park is part of the Eagle Bay project. That muck is being trucked to SFWMD-owned property on Limpkin Creek and to privately owned property. Ironically, rainfall levels recorded for the months of April and May at the Okeechobee County Airport have been higher than normal. As of midnight on May 29, 6.86 inches of rain fell at the airport during the month of May. The normal for the month is 3.93 inches. Vernon Gray, director of the airport, said that high total was due to thunderstorms on May 13, 14 and 18. Those three thunderstorms dropped an accumulation of 6.33 inches of rain on the airport. For a normal year, the rainfall accumulation by the end of May is 13.41 inches. As of midnight on May 29, 11.17 inches of rain had fallen for the year. For the past 17 months rainfall for Okeechobee is 5.64 inches below normal.

Jobs @ The Day Norwich Soldier&#39;s Death &#39;Great Loss&#39; For Family, Community Another young man from the region has died in Iraq. Once more our bell tolls. Again our hearts collectively ache for a promising young life ended far too soon. First Lt. Keith Heidtman of Norwich died when the Army helicopter he was co-piloting was shot down. He was 24. Lt. Heidtman was a graduate of Norwich Free Academy, where he was an honor student and athlete. He was also a 2005 graduate of the University of Connecticut, participating in the ROTC program. By all accounts, Lt. Heidtman&#39;s life held great promise. He was planning to head to law school after his military commitment ended. He was killed on Memorial Day. Those who gathered for ceremonies on village greens and lined up for local parades did not know then that one local young man had been added to the ranks of the honored dead they were remembering. Lt. Heidtman was one of 10 U.S. soldiers killed that day, all sacrificing their lives to try and bring order to a far-away country seemingly spinning out of control. On that same day two vehicle bombings in Baghdad killed 44 people, and the bodies of 32 men, shot and tortured, were discovered in two locations north and south of that anguished capital. While the parents of the newly dead were beginning a mourning process that will never fully end, Cindy Sheehan, the mother of another fallen soldier, Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, also 24 when killed, said she was withdrawing from her leadership role in the anti-war movement. Discouraged by the congressional vote to continue funding the war, Mrs. Sheehan said she was &#8220;going home for a while to try and be normal.&#8221; The harshest reality, wrote Mrs. Sheehan in an online diary, &#8220;was that Casey did, indeed, die for nothing.&#8221; She was wrong about that. The 3,467 military personnel so far killed during the Iraq conflict have died in service to their country, and that alone is a noble cause. And though many, including this newspaper, were critical of the decision to invade Iraq and have questioned the way it has been prosecuted, that does not make the service and sacrifice of our soldiers any less honorable. They were given the task of bringing down a dictator, and they did. They were then commissioned with providing security to a country divided by ancient religious and tribal animosities, so that democracy could take root. They have tried. Lt. Heidtman, we salute you.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Presidential Hopefuls Campaign in Calif. Thursday, May 31, 2007; 12:43 AM BURLINGAME, Calif. -- Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday declared that California's early primary has made the state more than a political ATM _ just as he accepted a check from a supporter and then headed to two fundraisers. California's Feb. 5 presidential primary seemed to be having a modest effect, with several major candidates blending their fundraising chores with campaign stops to greet potential voters. Mostly, however, the focus was on fundraising. Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani, center, shakes hands with supporter Mauro Bruschi, right, during a visit to Broadway Grill in Burlingame, Calif., Wednesday, May 30, 2007.(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Marcio Jose Sanchez - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article Democrats John Edwards and also trolled the nation's most delegate-rich state for cash and votes Wednesday. Between them, the three candidates held six California money events. Edwards, during an appearance between the four fundraisers he is holding over two days, decried the influence of money on politics and called for public financing of campaigns. "I'm not holier-than-thou about this. I've raised millions of dollars in 2004 and now to run for president," he added. "But that doesn't mean I think the system is good, because I don't." Giuliani stepped off a plane at San Francisco International Airport and promptly went to the Broadway Grill a few minutes away to chat with customers. His campaign ensured the lunchtime visit was stacked with supporters, sending out an e-mail Wednesday morning urging them to stop by the cafe en route to the fundraiser. Those crowded into the restaurant appeared to be a mix of regulars in T-shirts and committed supporters clad in suits and ties and bound for the fundraiser, which cost $250 and up. George Yerby handed the candidate a check for $200 on the spot. Giuliani hastily passed it to an aide. "He's going to be the next president," Yerby, 67, who lives in the wealthy Bay area enclave of Hillsborough, said afterward. "I hope." Giuliani closed his fundraisers here and in Beverly Hills to the public and news media. The restaurant stop, where he sipped orange juice and coffee, was open. He acknowledged to reporters outside the grill that raising money "has always been a big focus in California, like it was in New York."

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Berkeley mom Sheehan bows out as anti-Iraq war leader DEMOS DISAPPOINT GRIEVING PARENT By Angela K. Brown Article Launched: 05/30/2007 01:32:48 AM PDT FORT WORTH, Texas - Cindy Sheehan, the California soldier's mother who galvanized an anti-war movement with her monthlong protest outside President Bush's ranch, said Tuesday she's done being the public face of the movement. "I've been wondering why I'm killing myself and wondering why the Democrats caved in to George Bush," Sheehan told the Associated Press while driving from her property in Crawford to the airport, where she planned to return to California. "I'm going home for a while to try and be normal," she said. In what she described as a "resignation letter," Sheehan wrote in her online diary on the Daily Kos blog: "Good-bye America. ... You are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it. "It's up to you now." Sheehan began a grass-roots peace movement in August 2005 when she camped outside Bush's Crawford ranch for 26 days, demanding to talk with the president about her son's death. Army Spec. Casey Sheehan was 24 when he was killed in an ambush in Baghdad in 2004. Cindy Sheehan's protest started small but swelled to thousands and quickly drew national attention. Over the next two years, she drew huge crowds as she spoke at protest events. But she also drew criticism for some actions, such as meeting with Hugo Cha&#96;vez, Venezuela's leftist president. "I have endured a lot of smear and hatred since Casey was killed and especially since I became the so-called `face' of the American anti-war movement," Sheehan wrote in the diary. She had lived in Vacaville with her family, but when her marriage broke up in part because of her anti-war activism, she moved to Berkeley. Kristinn Taylor, spokesman for FreeRepublic.com, which has held pro-troop rallies and counterprotests of anti-war demonstrations, said dwindling crowds at Sheehan's Crawford protests since her initial vigil may have led to her decision. But he also said he hopes she will now be able to heal. "Her politics have hurt a lot of people, including the troops and their families. But most of us who support the war on terror understand she is hurt very deeply," Taylor said Tuesday. "Those she got involved with in the anti-war movement realize it was to their benefit to keep her in that stage of anger." When Sheehan first took on Bush, she was a darling of the liberal left. "However, when I started to hold the Democratic Party to the same standards that I held the Republican Party, support for my cause started to erode and the `left' started labeling me with the same slurs that the right used," she wrote in the diary. She said she sacrificed a 29-year marriage and endured threats to put all her energy into stopping the war. What she found, she wrote, was a movement "that often puts personal egos above peace and human life." She said the most devastating conclusion she had reached "was that Casey did indeed die for nothing ... killed by his own country which is beholden to and run by a war machine that even controls what we think." Sheehan told the AP that she had considered leaving the peace movement since last summer while recovering from surgery. She decided on Memorial Day to step down and spend more time with her three other children. She said she was returning to California on Tuesday because it was Casey's birthday. He would have been 28. "We've accomplished as much here as we're going to," Sheehan said, saying she was leaving to change course. "When we come back, it definitely won't be with the peace movement with marches, with rallies and with protests. It will be more humanitarian efforts." Last year, with &#36;52,500 in insurance money she received after her son's death, Sheehan bought five acres near downtown Crawford as a permanent site for protests. "It's for sale," she wrote in the diary. "Anyone want to buy five beautiful acres in Crawford, Texas&#63;" The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

"This is the first time we are accusing a blue-chip American company of profiting from torture," said ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner, who spoke about the case at a news conference in New York. Since at least 2001, , of San Jose, "has provided direct and substantial services to the United States for its so-called extraordinary rendition' program, enabling the clandestine and forcible transportation of suspects to secret overseas detention facilities where they are placed beyond the reach of the law and subjected to torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment," the suit alleges. A spokesman for Jeppesen said: "There isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for them." "Publicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standards," the suit states. Jeppesen provided flight and logistical support services to aircraft and crew used in the rendition program "to unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in , Egypt, and Afghanistan," adds the suit brought on behalf of three men. They are Binyam Mohammed, a British resident who was taken into custody in and is now being held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba; Abou Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and is currently being held in Morocco, and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian citizen, who while seeking asylum in was arrested by Swedish security police, handed over to CIA agents, shackled, drugged, and flown to Cairo from Stockholm, according to the suit. ACLU attorneys, including the organization's executive director, Anthony Romero, said they had obtained information about the rendition program from a variety of sources, including probes in Spain and Sweden and press reports, in particular an article by Jane Mayer in the New Yorker on October 30, portions of which were quoted in the lawsuit. Ms. Mayer wrote that a former Jeppesen employee told her that at a company board meeting a senior Jeppesen official stated: "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights  you know the torture flights. Let's face it, some of these flights end up that way." The case, filed under the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789, which enables foreigners to sue in U.S. courts for human-rights violations, is expected to be vigorously fought in court not only by Jeppesen but also by the CIA. The agency was not named as a defendant in the case, but it is possible that the agency will ask a federal judge for permission to intervene and seek to have the case dismissed under the "state-secrets" doctrine. Last March, a federal appeals court in Richmond, , dismissed a case filed by a German citizen who was subjected to extraordinary rendition. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the civil suit filed by Khaled El-Masri could not be reviewed in an American court because of the government's invocation of the "state-secrets" privilege.

The blue chip company has allegedly been involved with the Central Intelligence Agency with âthe forced disappearance, torture and inhumane treatmentâ of three men suspected of being terrorists. According to the suit, âPublicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standardsâ. The three men on behalf of whom the suit was brought includes Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian, who was allegedly mistreated in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and subjected to torture in May 2002 and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian who, while seeking asylum in Sweden was arrested by Swedish police and handed over to the CIA, underwent torture in December 2001. While Mohamed is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Britel is being held in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt. Mike pound, a spokesperson for Jeppesen has said, âThere isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for themâ. Boeingâs representative Timothy Neale has commented, âWe have not gotten the lawsuit yet, so we are not commenting on it. We are not confirming the reports that Jeppesen did work for the CIA. The services Jeppesen provides are provided on a confidential basis for all its customers.â The suit alleges that the detainees were taken to countries where they underwent inhumane, degrading treatment and torture since they were beyond the reach of the law. The suit also states that Jeppesen provided services to the flight and crew used in the rendition program âto unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistanâ. The suspects were apprehended under the U.S. government's âextraordinary rendition programâ. Extraordinary rendition is the clandestine capture and transfer of suspects to be detained and interrogated in countries where the protection of U.S. laws does not apply, said Ben Wizner, an ACLU attorney. He also said that âEither they knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program.â The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Save & Share Article A sheepish Lauer admitted his mistake after "Today" ran the interview, which was conducted Tuesday. "I should have set a better example," he said. Romney also said he needs to keep reminding himself to buckle up. Corzine was riding in a State Police-driven SUV that crashed going 91 mph on April 12 along the Garden State Parkway. Corzine, unbuckled in the front passenger seat, broke his leg, 11 ribs, collarbone and sternum. He voluntarily paid a $46 fine and apologized to the state. He also released a public service announcement urging people to wear seat belts. "Today" show producers noticed the oversight before the segment with Romney aired and decided to have Lauer address it, executive producer Jim Bell said. Viewers certainly noticed. "Today" got more than 100 e-mails about Lauer and Romney's oversights while the segment was being telecast, Bell said. "It was amazing," he said.

Fees to go up WASHINGTON | Beginning July 30, immigrants applying for citizenship or temporary work permits will pay almost twice as much as they do now under a plan unveiled Tuesday by the Bush administration. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services: &#8226;The application fee for citizenship would rise from $330 to $675. &#8226;The fee to apply for status as a legal permanent resident would increase from $325 to $1,010 for most applicants. Those age 79 and older or under age 14 would pay $930. &#8226;The cost of work permits would rise from $180 to $340. The agency will continue to waive the fees for military members applying for citizenship. GLYNCO, Ga. | Firing back at conservative critics, President Bush defended his plan to overhaul immigration laws Tuesday and accused its opponents of &#8220;trying to rile up people&#8217;s emotions&#8221; with misinformation. In an interview with McClatchy Newspapers and in a speech in Georgia, Bush expressed his determination to fight for changes that would let millions of illegal immigrants gain legal status. He cast the debate as a struggle over the country&#8217;s soul and its reputation as a welcoming nation. &#8220;I&#8217;m deeply concerned about America losing its soul,&#8221; the president said in the interview on Air Force One. &#8220;Immigration has been the lifeblood of a lot of our country&#8217;s history. I am worried that a backlash to newcomers would cause our country to lose its great capacity to assimilate newcomers.&#8221; Bush underscored his commitment to the proposed overhaul, despite harsh criticism from some conservatives. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard some of the talk out there about people defining the bill,&#8221; he told an audience at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco. &#8220;It&#8217;s clear they hadn&#8217;t read the bill. They&#8217;re speculating about what the bill says, and they&#8217;re trying to rile up people&#8217;s emotions. &#8220;If you want to kill the bill, if you don&#8217;t want to do what&#8217;s right for America, you can pick one little aspect out of it, you can use it to frighten people. Or you can show leadership and solve this problem once and for all.&#8221; Bush acknowledged that the proposed overhaul faces a difficult time in Congress, where it is under attack from both ends of the political spectrum. Conservative critics contend that it amounts to an amnesty program because illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay in the country after paying $1,000 fines. Some liberals complain that plans for a new temporary-worker program are overly restrictive and would create a permanent underclass of foreign workers. The bill seeks to strike a balance between tougher border enforcement and a more welcoming policy toward the estimated 12 million immigrants who are already in the country illegally. Bush hopes to push it through Congress with help from a bipartisan group of lawmakers that includes Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican. In the interview, Bush traced his commitment to immigration to his time in Texas. &#8220;When you grow up in Texas like I did, you recognize the decency and humanity of Hispanics,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the truth of the matter is: A lot of this immigration debate is driven as a result of Latinos being in our country. I have seen firsthand the beautiful stories of people being able to take advantage of opportunity and make solid contributions to our society.&#8221; He said that Americans had nothing to fear from large-scale immigration from Latin America. &#8220;There is an element of our society that is worried about two Americas,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our ability to welcome newcomers and the system&#8217;s capacity to assimilate them has been one of the great powerful traditions of America. It works, and it will work this time.&#8221; Fees to go up WASHINGTON | Beginning July 30, immigrants applying for citizenship or temporary work permits will pay almost twice as much as they do now under a plan unveiled Tuesday by the Bush administration.

Mississippi's rural roots and modern anxieties were on display as the judge and lawyers winnowed the pool to 55 people, from which lawyers hope to pick a dozen to decide whether James Ford Seale, now 71, took part in abducting and killing Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee. The two 19-year-olds were beaten and dumped, still alive, into the Mississippi River. Seale, who has denied membership in the Klan, faces up to life in prison if convicted of kidnapping and conspiracy in the latest of more than a dozen civil rights-era cases that have been prosecuted across the South since the early 1990s. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate is keeping jurors' names a secret at the request of prosecutors who said some might fear to serve in a case involving the Klan. One potential juror from rural southwest Mississippi said one of her cousins is married to one of Seale's cousins. "That makes me nervous, even though I don't know him personally," the woman said nodding toward Seale. Among the 20 other people dismissed from the initial group of 76 potential jurors were a one-armed chicken grower who said he needs to tend to his poultry to pay his bills, and a young woman in a Confederate battle flag T-shirt. Seale, having changed out of his orange jail jumpsuit into khaki pants and a light blue dress shirt, listened quietly in court through wishbone-shaped earphones to amplify the sound because of his hearing problems. When he left, his jail jumpsuit was topped by a bullet-resistant vest. He faces potentially damaging testimony from a man also charged back in 1964. Moore and Dee were hitchhiking May 2, 1964, when carloads of Klansmen were chasing rumors of a possible armed insurrection by black people in the area. The two were driven to the Homochitto National Forest and beaten, then stuffed into a trunk and driven more than 70 miles to the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, according to court records. They were weighted down with engine parts and dumped into the Mississippi, still breathing. Their bodies were found about two months later, when authorities were conducting an intenstive search for slain civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, who disappeared from central Mississippi's Neshoba County on June 21, 1964. Seale and reputed Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards were arrested in 1964 in the deaths of Dee and Moore. But the FBI was consumed by the "Mississippi Burning" investigation of the three civil rights workers, and the Dee-Moore case was turned over to local authorities, who threw out all charges against Seale and Edwards. The Justice Department reopened an investigation in 2000. The FBI closed the case again in 2003 only to reopen it in 2005. Edwards has been granted immunity and is expected to testify for the prosecution. Thomas Moore and two of Dee's sisters &mdash; Thelma Collins, 70, of Springfield, La.; and Mary Nell Byrd, 61, of Natchez, Miss. &mdash; sat near each other in the courtroom Wednesday. The three spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday in Jackson during an interview arranged by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. documentary maker David Ridgen. Since 2005, Ridgen and Thomas Moore have pushed federal officials to reopen the case. Ridgen's film, "Mississippi Cold Case," is to air June 9 on MSNBC. Collins and Moore said they're prepared for any verdict from the jurors. "I just have it in my heart that they're going to do the right thing," Collins said. Moore has already planned what he'll do after the trial, regardless of the outcome.

Justice Dept. probes its hirings Investigating for bias toward conservatives By Charlie Savage, Globe Staff | WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has launched an internal investigation into whether Bush administration officials violated civil service rules by favoring conservative Republicans when hiring lawyers in the Civil Rights Division, the department disclosed yesterday in a letter to Congress. The probe will also examine whether the administration illegally used a political litmus test when vetting candidates for non-partisan positions elsewhere in the Justice Department, according to the heads of the department's offices of inspector general and professional responsibility. The disclosure that the two watchdogs are focusing on the Civil Rights Division marks an expansion to a new arena of the Justice Department of an ongoing investigation into whether politics played a role in the firing of nine US attorneys in 2006. The probe has widened to encompass allegations that the administration has used its control of the Justice Department to gain a partisan edge. "This is to notify you that we have expanded the scope of our investigation to include allegations regarding improper political and other considerations in hiring decisions within the Department of Justice," wrote Inspector General Glenn Fine and Office of Professional Responsibility chief Marshall Jarrett , who are conducting a joint inquiry. Under federal law, officials may not take political affiliation into account when hiring career professionals, permanent, non-partisan employees who stay on when an administration changes. But last week, a former aide to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , Monica Goodling , told Congress that she had "crossed the line" by attempting to block liberal applicants from being hired as career assistant prosecutors and immigration judges. Goodling, a key figure in the US attorney firings who resigned in April, was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony. While it was known that Goodling's hiring practices were under investigation, the letter made clear for the first time that the internal probe has now been extended to hiring by other administration appointees as well. "Among the issues that we intend to investigate are allegations regarding Monica Goodling's and others' actions in DOJ hiring and personnel decisions; allegations concerning hiring for the DOJ Honors Program and Summer Law Intern Program; and allegations concerning hiring practices in the DOJ Civil Rights Division," they wrote. The offices did not disclose whom else they are investigating. Dean Boyd , a Justice spokesman, declined to comment on the probe's expansion. The Honors Program is the main way the department hires professionals who have recently graduated from law school or completed judicial clerkships. For decades, hiring decisions were made by veteran career officials. But in the fall of 2002, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft changed the rules to give political appointees greater control over career hiring. The result was a change in the profile of newly hired professionals, career Justice attorneys say, as non partisan positions were effectively turned into political appointments. In April, a group of Justice officials sent an anonymous letter to Congress alleging that political appointees were systematically screening out applicants who had worked for liberal groups or Democrats, thereby "politicizing the non-political ranks of Justice Department employees, offices which are consistently and methodically being eroded by partisan politics." Current and former career attorneys say that the changes had a particularly dramatic impact on the Civil Rights Division, which is charged with enforcing voting-rights and anti discrimination laws on behalf of minorities. Critics alleged that the administration was seeking to blunt the division's aggressiveness by hiring conservative activists to decide how and when to enforce the laws. Such allegations dovetailed with the resumes of successful applicants to several sections of the Civil Rights Division from 2001 to 2006. The Globe obtained the resumes last year using the Freedom of Information Act. Starting in 2003, after political appointees took greater control of the process, the number of new hires with prior experience in traditional civil rights enforcement plunged. Meanwhile, new hires with strong conservative credentials -- such as membership in the Federalist Society or the Republican National Lawyers Association -- rose significantly, the resumes showed. The political reshaping of the division may have been greater than the resumes show. According to McClatchy Newspapers, Bradley Schlozman , a politically appointed supervisor in the Civil Rights Division from 2003 to 2006, told two applicants in 2005 to delete reference to membership in conservative groups from their resumes and resubmit them. Both were then hired. Schlozman also later became the first replacement US attorney after the firings began in 2006. He served a year without Senate confirmation as the top prosecutor in western Missouri. Schlozman is set to testify before Congress next month. In late April, the Justice Department went back to a system in which career officials will handle most of the hiring for vacancies in the professional ranks and selecting interns, both at the Civil Rights Division and throughout the department. Boyd said the changes were made "to avoid even the perception of any political influence in the process." But former Civil Rights Division lawyers have voiced skepticism about whether the change will make much difference, since many of the career officials who will be making hiring decisions are the same conservative-leaning attorneys who were hired in recent years. Justice officials said that the recent change to hiring rules was prompted by Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty following a December 2006 meeting during which career professionals clashed with McNulty's chief of staff, Michael Elston , over the removal of the names of Democratic-linked candidates from a list of potential interviewees. McNulty announced his resignation earlier this month. The chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, said yesterday that news of the expanded internal probe reinforced their determination to push forward with their own investigation of the Justice Department. "I look forward to the results of the inspector general's investigation," Leahy said. "As Congress continues its oversight into the politicization of the Justice Department, it is abundantly clear that we must do all we can to get to the truth behind this matter and the role the White House played in it." &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

The latest addition to the list is Sylvester Turner, D-Houston -- a well-known figure at the capitol and, at least until Wednesday's filing, an ally of Speaker Tom Craddick, R-Midland. Besides Craddick and Turner, three candidates also ran for speaker at the opening of the 80th Regular Session: Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, Rep. Brian McCall, R-Plano, and Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie. Thompson withdrew her name and endorsed McCall in January -- and then McCall withdrew and endorsed Pitts -- only to see Pitts withdraw his name after a test vote suggested Craddick had the votes to hold onto the chair. Three other Republicans threw their hats in the ring during the end-of-session wrangling over ousting Craddick, including Delwin Jones, R-Lubbock, Fred Hill, R-Dallas, and Jim Keffer, R-Eastland. In total, there are eight candidates for speaker -- an unprecedented number of candidates. Traditionally, candidates for speaker start rounding up 'pledges' from members of the House immediately after the end of the session -- there are 150 representatives -- and many will face bitter primary battles. All must win re-election from their districts. With Turner's entry into the race, the only recognizable truth about the race is that Craddick's support is far from solid, and you can bet that things will change. The next possible speaker's election will occur at the beginning of the next regular or special session. A special session could be called at any time, and the next regular session will begin in January 2009. As a staff member in Rep. Keffer's office said, "It's going to be an interesting 18 or 19 months." (&copy; MMVII, CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.)

http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_6016444&cid El Paso Times - Immigration services fees rise July 30, so file now Immigration services fees rise July 30, so file now By Louie Gilot / El Paso Times Article Launched: 05/30/2007 12:00:00 AM MDT Immigrants have two more months to file for a variety of services, including naturalization, before paying hundreds of dollars in higher processing fees, Citizenship and Immigration Services officials said Tuesday. The agency on Tuesday announced its new fee schedule and the July 30 deadline. Some of the fees will more than double after the deadline. For instance, filing for permanent residency, or a "green card," will cost $1,010, including biometric fees -- the fees for fingerprinting, photographing and capturing the signatures of applicants -- up from $395. Filing for citizenship will cost $675, up from $400. A complete fee list is available at www.uscis.gov. Immigrant advocates expected a rush of immigrant filing petitions in the next two months to avoid the higher fees. Clara Lugo, a permanent resident and a scheduler for a doctor's office in El Paso, said the new fee structure motivated her to file for naturalization after 25 years in the United States. "I've been procrastinating. My family is always telling me so. Even my dad became a citizen already. I've never felt the urge. But this is it. This is my deadline," she said. Overall, the fee increases are not as high as had been proposed earlier, partly because of a review of more than 3,900 public comments, many of which were critical, agency officials said. "We proposed our new fee structure with the expectation of ongoing discussions with the public on this important issue," said CIS Director Emilio Gonzalez in a written statement. "The volume and value of the comments we received has provided an opportunity to fine-tune our final fee structure that we believe is both fair to our customers and vital to our nation as we continue to build a secure and efficient national immigration service." For instance, filing for permanent residency for a child under 14 filing with his family will cost $360 less than proposed. But it will still be $600 per child, in addition to the $1,010 per parent. "I still worry that a lot of people are not going to be able to afford these fees. A lot of people who are eligible for benefits are simply not going to apply. Right now the number one reason for not applying for benefits is the fees," said Iliana Holguin, executive director of the Diocesan Migrant and Refugee Services of El Paso. CIS officials said the fees are needed to improve service at the agency. Officials said that the new revenue would lead to a 20 percent reduction in average application processing times by the end of fiscal year 2009. Forms are now processed by a paper-based system. Part of the additional revenue from higher fees will be used to process applications electronically. Some will continue to be exempt from paying fees: victims of human trafficking, victims of violence against women, refugees, U.S. citizens filing for their immigrant spouses and members of the U.S. military. The biometric fees rise from $70 to $80, as proposed. Louie Gilot may be reached at lgilot@elpasotimes.com, 546-6131.

Seale is charged with kidnapping and conspiracy charges connected to the 1964 slayings of the black teenagers in southwest Mississippi. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) JACKSON, Miss. - The cold case trial got under way Wednesday in the deaths of two black teenagers who were beaten and dumped still alive into the Mississippi River during the state's dark days of racial brutality. Ku Klux Klansman James Ford Seale faces federal kidnapping and conspiracy charges , along with potentially damaging testimony from a man also charged back in 1964. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate began questioning prospective jurors Wednesday. "We're at the doorstep of justice," said Thomas Moore, the brother of one of the victims, Charles Eddie Moore. For decades, books and news accounts treated the killings of Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee as footnotes in Mississippi's troubled history. They were 19-year-old friends who were hitchhiking on May 2, 1964, near Meadville when carloads of Ku Klux Klansmen were chasing rumors of a possible armed insurrection by black people in the area. Recent court records said the two were driven to the Homochitto National Forest and beaten, then stuffed into a trunk and driven more than 70 miles to the Mississippi River near Vicksburg. They were weighted down with engine parts and dumped, still breathing, into the Mississippi. Their bodies were found about two months later, when authorities were conducting a massive search for slain civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, who disappeared from central Mississippi's Neshoba County on June 21, 1964. Seale and reputed Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards were arrested in 1964 in the deaths of Dee and Moore. But the FBI was consumed by the "Mississippi Burning" investigation of the three civil rights workers and the Dee-Moore case was turned over to local authorities, who threw out all charges against Seale and Edwards. The Justice Department in 2000 reopened an investigation. Edwards has been granted immunity and is expected to testify for the prosecution. Thomas Moore and two of Dee's sisters , Thelma Collins, 70, of Springfield, La.; and Mary Nell Byrd, 61, of Natchez, Miss. , spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday in Jackson during an interview arranged by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. documentary maker David Ridgen. Since 2005, Ridgen and Thomas Moore have pushed federal officials to reopen the case. Ridgen's film, "Mississippi Cold Case," is set to air Saturday night on MSNBC. "I try not to think about it so much because, you know, it's done now," Collins said of her brother's death. "But every time I think about it, I shed a tear." Dee and Charles Moore were not troublemakers, their families say. "My thing is, Charles Moore and Henry Dee wasn't bothering anybody," Thomas Moore said Tuesday. "And for them to be butchered, tormented, hassled and drowned in the river , it was pretty bad." Collins and Moore said they're prepared for any outcome in the Seale trial. "I just have it in my heart that they're going to do the right thing," Collins said. Moore has already planned what he'll do after the trial, regardless of the outcome. "The last thing that I'm going to do when I leave Mississippi, I'm going to go to that cemetery, that Mount Olive Cemetery. I'm going to tell Charles Moore, 'I told you that I (would) see it to the end.'"

An icon to the anti-war left, a lightning rod to many on the conservative right, as well as family members of U.S. troops, Cindy Sheehan has announced her "retirement" from the movement she gave such a public face to. This brings her full circle, back to where this compelling saga first began: Cindy Sheehan, grieving mother. We think that might be just the voice Casey Sheehan's mother is looking for. If that sounds condescending or patronizing to Sheehan, it's not meant to. Any suggestions that the mother of Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, who was 24 when he was killed in an ambush in Baghdad in 2004, should simply have kept her concerns and protests quiet are not only misguided, but, well, un-American. No, Sheehan, formerly of Vacaville, was well within her rights to protest what she saw as the United States making a serious mistake in invading Iraq. And she no doubt takes at least some small comfort from national polls showing most Americans agreeing with the core message of the grass-roots peace movement she helped jump-start. Its infancy came at that makeshift campsite outside President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, where she parked herself for 26 days, demanding the opportunity to discuss her son's death with the president. What she said was her lone, simple question - "Why" - over her son's death ignited a national movement that swelled to thousands of participants. Were it to be kept that simple. Sheehan went from merely being a symbol of the anti-war movement to being its full-time celebrity spokesperson. It was a bumpy road from media darling to activist to shooting duck for pro-military target practice sessions. Was Sheehan smeared, misquoted and unfairly targeted by the right, a victim of what she says were slurs that eventually came from those on the left, as well? Or, with her ill-advised appearances with Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's leftist president, and her reckless rhetoric, filled with increasingly bitter name-calling and careless use of the word "terrorist," did she merely bring it all on herself? The answer likely lies somewhere in the middle. It seemed only fitting that the same traits that marked Sheehan's public persona - sadness and bitterness - were at the heart of her "resignation letter" from the anti-war protest movement, posted in her online diary on the Daily Kos blog. Her frustration at the Democrats' failure - or unwillingness - to get out of Iraq is shared by millions of Americans, but her last posting was all her. "Good-bye America," wrote Sheehan. "You are not the country that I loved ... I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it." With that, the property that Sheehan bought in Crawford for her and fellow protesters - "Camp Casey," she called it - was put up for sale. She's back home in California, where she said she plans to spend more time with her children. The Times-Herald editorial board consists of Publisher Ron Rhea, Editor Ted Vollmer, Managing Editor Jack F.K. Bungart and City Editor Mary Leahy Enbom. She'll do so without her 29-year marriage, which she says she sacrificed to put more energy into stopping the war. And, of course, she'll do so without Casey. Hopefully she'll do it with some peace in her heart. Love her actions or loathe her politics, she's earned that much. Use the comment link provided below to share your thoughts on this story.

Lewis to consolidate soldier memorials | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | News Ft. Lewis to consolidate soldier memorials May 30, 2007 at 8:40 AM PDT May 30, 2007 at 7:39 PM PDT KOMO Staff & News Services FORT LEWIS, Wash. - So many Fort Lewis soldiers are being killed in Iraq the Army base will no longer hold individual memorial services. Starting next month Fort Lewis says it will hold one memorial a month for all the dead soldiers. Nineteen Fort Lewis soldiers have been killed this month -- the most of the war, so far. Fort Lewis acting commander Brigadier General William Troy told staff last week that the number of soldiers in harm's way will preclude individual services. About 10,000 Fort Lewis troops, including two Stryker brigades, are now in Iraq, the most since the 2003 invasion. Some other Army posts have already consolidated services. A memorial service planned for Thursday for one soldier will go on as scheduled at Fort Lewis, and the first consolidated service for four soldiers will be held on June 5. 3 More Fort Lewis Soldiers Killed Meanwhile, the Department of Defense announced Wednesday that three more Fort Lewis soldiers were killed in Iraq in two separate attacks in the past week. Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif., and Cpl. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami, died Monday when an explosive detonated nearby during a dismounted patrol in Baghdad. Both were assigned to 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, one of two Fort Lewis Stryker brigades serving in Iraq. On Saturday, Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho, died in Baghdad when his vehicle was hit by a homemade bomb. Hester was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment with the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, Fort Lewis' other Stryker Brigade Combat Team that has been in Iraq since June. Hester had been in the Army three years, joining in May 2004. He arrived at Fort Lewis in September 2004, where he was assigned to the 3rd Brigade. McFall joined the Army in October 1994 and served a year in Korea beginning February 1997. He then reported to Fort Lewis to serve with the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment. In April 2001, McFall was stationed at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and deployed to Afghanistan with the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment from April 2004 through March 2005. He returned to Fort Lewis that September and had served since January with the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment. Sanchez joined the Army in November 2005 and reported to Fort Lewis last June for assignment to the 4th Brigade's 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry. The unit left for Iraq last month. He was posthumously promoted from the rank of private first class. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free! The latest news video from KOMO.

The money is the next test,&#34; said Tom Ingram in a telephone interview yesterday. Mr. Thompson, who won election twice as a Republican senator from Tennessee and appeared in films including The Hunt for Red October , was not immediately available for comment. Mr. Ingram now serves as chief of staff to Senator Lamar Alexander, also a Tennessee Republican. If he decides to seek the U.S. presidency, Mr. Thompson would join a crowded Republican field with no dominant choice. President George W. Bush, prohibited from running for a third term in November 2008, is set to leave office in January 2009. When Mr. Thompson's name is included in public opinion polls with candidates such as former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, he ranks among the top candidates along with them. Mr. Thompson, who plays district attorney Arthur Branch in the television show , would not be the first Hollywood actor to gain national prominence in politics if he decides to seek the White House. In 1980, California governor and former B-movie star Ronald Reagan was elected president. More recently, in 2003, Austrian-born bodybuilder and star Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor of California. Ten men are already running for the Republican nomination and former House speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia also is weighing a campaign. Mr. Thompson was first elected to the Senate in 1994 to fill Democrat Al Gore's seat when he became vice-president. Phil G ... LOL!! I hope he runs his presidency in his character from... Reagan was an actor before he was President. It's not... What's next, a President from As the World Turns?

That's right - the grieving mother who morphed into an anti-war icon is exiting the stage. "I have spent every available cent I got from the money a 'grateful' country gave me when they killed my son and every penny that I have received in speaking or book fees since then," Sheehan writes. "I have sacrificed a 29 year marriage and have traveled for extended periods of time away from Casey's brother and sisters and my health has suffered and my hospital bills from last summer (when I almost died) are in collection because I have used all my energy trying to stop this country from slaughtering innocent human beings." She also writes, "The most devastating conclusion that I reached &#91;on Memorial Day morning&#93;, however, was that Casey did indeed die for nothing. His precious lifeblood drained out in a country far away from his family who loves him, killed by his own country which is beholden to and run by a war machine that even controls what we think. I have tried every since he died to make his sacrifice meaningful. Casey died for a country which &#91;sic&#93; cares more about who will be the next American Idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while Democrats and Republicans play politics with human lives. It is so painful to me to know that I bought into this system for so many years and Casey paid the price for that allegiance. I failed my boy and that hurts the most." In general, any parent who has lost a child in Iraq or Afghanistan deserves the nation's respect and sympathy. The scars from that sort of loss to a family are deep and permanent, to put it simply. But, unfortunately for Cindy Sheehan, being a Gold Star mom doesn't grant her immunity from criticism when she comes off as a self-aggrandizing opportunist or dishonors her son's service. Full disclosure here: Sheehan's efforts have served me personally. She made me realize - for all my frustration and displeasure over the activities of the Bush administration and for all the cutting edge music I've downloaded in recent years - I'm still no liberal. You see, to truly be a liberal in America today you have to cast yourself as an all-caring, all-feeling being while at the same time demonstrating utter disdain for those who dare to hold strong convictions that differ from yours. And that's why she's leaving the arena: For all of her stunts, for all of her happenings, for all of her soundbites, the majority of this nation doesn't agree with her - on anything she says. So she's doing what every good and modern liberal does when things get tough: She's taking her floppy sun hat and going home . . . wherever that is. You see, she lost her husband and her money and nearly her remaining kids . . . but you know that because she told you. And she told you because this joke of a movement she concocted a few years ago is all about her. As her name recognition and star power increased in anti-war circles, she grew into the typical American celebrity: cocky, pompous and self-absorbed. She was the show - a big draw, a headliner. What she said mattered because she said it. Just ask her; she'd tell you. But as with most who attempt to trade on public sentiments, the arc of fame is swift and impartial. Cindy quickly went the way of Andrew Dice Clay. The crowds stopped showing up. The planners stopped asking her to be a headliner. (And she can't appear if she's not the headliner, can she?) She became a parody of herself faster than she could cheer, "What do we want? Peace! When do we want it? Now!" It wasn't her fault. It couldn't have been. After all, she was Cindy Sheehan, rally headliner. Well, read on, Daily Kos readers. It was those damn conservatives and their hate squads and those weak Democrats who were supposed to pull the plug on the war. (Yes, as Sheehan swings at the pinata that is her exit from the public eye, she actually takes aim at the party that made her.) Then in a (hopefully) final act of perceived defiance, she goes from embarrasing to inexcusable. She stains her son's honor once and for all by claiming he died for nothing - a shameless and desperate attempt to one-up her critics. She would sell her son out in death to try and win an argument and in so doing she fades into the sunset as nothing more than a pathetic joke - a wholly unsympathetic character. But there's more. At the end of the requiem of sorts she takes another three pedantic steps back and chucks a Hail Mary of a liberal cliché, writing, "You are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it. It's up to you now." Thanks, Cindy; we've got it. If you would have taken the time to stop listening to yourself and push away from the podium at some point in the last three years you would have realized we had it all along. You see, we who differ from your point of view didn't come into our beliefs arbitrarily. We earned them - a concept foreign to most liberals who have more ego than life experiences. And while we're at it, we'll go ahead and preserve Casey's honor in spite of you, honor that is timeless and exists outside of the political spectacle you've attempted to make it. Regardless of how callous you demonstrate yourself to be, those who understand the notion of service over self will never accept the idea that he died for nothing. Sound Off...What do you think?

The loudest jeers were reserved for Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, the amendment&#8217;s most prominent opponent, and seven black or Hispanic council members who abstained from voting. But while the outcome was widely expected, the high-decibel meeting, preceded by a rally on the steps of City Hall, was a stark contrast to the normally subdued process the Council goes through once or twice a year in choosing people to honor with street names. It was also one the most divisive issues to confront Ms. Quinn, the council&#8217;s first openly gay speaker and an ardent supporter of civil rights causes, in her year and half as speaker. At one point, Councilman Charles Barron, a Brooklyn Democrat and a former Black Panther, refused to stop talking after his two-minute comment period. Wagging a finger in Ms. Quinn&#8217;s direction, Mr. Barron said, &#8220;You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever did.&#8221; For her part, Ms. Quinn said of Mr. Carson, &#8220;He was not an individual who sought to bring our city together.&#8221; Mr. Carson, who died in 2002, was an ex-convict who became a community advocate and antidrug crusader. Some saw him as a community leader, but others saw him as a thug and a bigot. Once asked about charges of being anti-Semitic, he said: &#8220;That&#8217;s absolutely absurd, &#8216;anti-Semitic.&#8217; And so you don&#8217;t ask the question, I&#8217;m antiwhite. Don&#8217;t limit my antis to just one group of people.&#8221; He was convicted in 1974 of kidnapping in a case prosecutors described as a vigilante-style attack that left one person dead and another near death. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. He re-emerged in the 1980s to crusade against drugs and police brutality. &#8220;Sonny Carson got more crack houses closed than the entire Police Department,&#8221; Mr. Barron said during the premeeting rally. In 1990, Mr. Carson led a boycott of Korean-owned delis in black neighborhoods, carrying picket signs that said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shop with people who don&#8217;t look like us.&#8221; Michael C. Nelson, chairman of the Council&#8217;s Jewish Caucus, recalled the time when Mr. Carson first received national attention as a militant protester during the struggle for community control of public schools. &#8220;Thirty-seven years ago, Sonny Carson walked into my wife&#8217;s classroom and said he didn&#8217;t want any white Jews teaching his children, and he also said he would carve his initials on her chest if she didn&#8217;t leave,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am voting no.&#8221; has said of Mr. Carson that there is probably no one who less deserves a street named after him. Councilman Albert Vann, a Brooklyn Democrat who introduced the amendment, said that whether you agreed or disagreed with Mr. Carson&#8217;s tactics, the community should have the right to decide whom to name streets after. Community Board 3 of Brooklyn had voted in favor of renaming four blocks of Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant to Sonny Abubadika Carson Avenue. Community Board support is required to rename a street, for which Council approval is usually little more than a formality. There were 51 names on the Council&#8217;s list this year, including the actor Jerry Orbach and the modern dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.

Professor William Grays team also kept with the prediction of a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the United States coastline. Hurricane season starts Friday and runs through Nov. 30. Grays team says cooler Pacific Ocean waters near the equator should result in fewer trade winds this year to suppress hurricanes. Its the opposite cycle to the El Nino last year that warmed the Pacific and drove more trade winds to shear apart storms in their early stages. El Nino conditions during the summer and fall, similar to those that developed in 2006, tend to decrease Atlantic hurricane activity by increasing vertical wind shear across the area where Atlantic tropical cyclones develop, Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State team said in a prepared statement. Only 10 named storms -- five hurricanes and two major hurricanes -- developed last year. The long-term averages over the past 55 years is 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year. Earlier this month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it expects 13 to 17 named storms this year, including seven to 10 hurricanes  three to five with winds greater than 110 mph. NOAA anticipates a 75 percent chance of above normal season, a 20 percent chance near normal, and a 5 percent chance below normal season. NOAA officials said most tropical storms and hurricanes should form August through October over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, as is typical for above-normal seasons. Historically, above-normal seasons average two-to-four hurricane landfalls in the continental United States. Also this month, a University of Central Florida statistics professor and his Georgia colleague estimated Brevard County has a 19.4 percent chance of at least 74 mph winds this season, compared with the long-term average of 8.6 percent chance of winds that strong.

The fee increases will take effect July 30. Citizenship fees will rise from $330 to $595, plus $80 for required electronic fingerprints, an increase of $10. For legal permanent residency and fingerprints the cost will be $1,010 for those over 14. The cost now is $325. Officials with Citizenship and Immigration Services, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, said the increases are needed to improve service, hire 1,500 workers, improve offices, equipment and systems to process applications. "This agency is fee based, 99 percent of our budget comes from user fees. We need to be the agency people expect us to be. We need to undertake reforms .... The only way to get from there to here is to have the financial resources to do that," CIS Director Emilio Gonzalez said Tuesday. Many immigration groups and some Democratic members of Congress have protested the fee increases, saying they will put citizenship and legal immigration out of reach of many immigrants. They also question whether better service will follow. The new fees were to be published this week in the Federal Register and also were posted on the CIS Web site.

In his ruling, Judge Maurice J. Gallipoli rejected the argument of attorney Daniel Horgan, representing West New York, that parade organizers were running what amounted to "a charitable fraud" that claimed to use the parade to raise money for scholarships and other charities but actually were running a for-profit enterprise. Parade organizers and others had claimed the permit was denied for political reasons, and implied that Vega took the action to avoid having to walk alongside Union City Mayor Brian Stack in the parade. Vega and Stack are opposing one another for a state Senate seat in next Tuesday's primary. "It's been a tremendous ordeal through a mayor who was a little messed up in the head," Emilio Del Valle, the parade's founder, said after the ruling. Vega did not immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment Wednesday. Attorney Elise DiNardo, representing Del Valle, contended that the denial of the permit amounted to a curtailment of First Amendment rights because it didn't reflect "any governmental purpose or concern" such as crowd control or safety. The parade has passed through West New York since its inception in 2000 and annually draws about 350,000 people. The controversy began two weeks ago when Vega announced he would deny the permit and said he would lie down in front of the marchers to keep them out. The towns of North Bergen and Guttenberg, which the parade also has traditionally passed through, subsequently did not issue permits as they waited for the dispute to be resolved. Attorneys for West New York claimed in court that the Latin American Kiwanis Club, which hosts the parade, was "misusing the Kiwanis name to operate a for-profit, sponsorship operation." The argument didn't sway Gallipoli. "There's a balance to be struck," the judge said. "Let the parade go on and report these people to the appropriate authorities and let them investigate it." Del Valle conceded that the Latin American Kiwanis Club had its charter revoked and would need to pay back dues to have it restored. "They were just doing this now because they have no leg to stand on after what their mayor said," Del Valle said, referring to the charges by Horgan.

Judge Maurice J. Gallipoli ruled yesterday that West New York Mayor Salvatore "Sal" Vega did not have a valid reason to deny the parade committee's application to march through West New York. "The parade and the parade committee got more justice in one day than the people in Cuba have gotten in 48 years," said Vega. "That's the difference between the government of our great nation and the government that people struggle with every day in Cuba." In defending his decision to deny the parade access to West New York, Vega had claimed it was wrong to celebrate while Cubans remain oppressed under Fidel Castro. Town attorney Daniel E. Horgan said he does not know if West New York will appeal the judge's decision. The parade in the past had run from Bergenline Avenue in North Bergen, through West New York and ended in Union City. After Vega initially denied the application, organizers had planned for the parade to run from Bergenline at 22nd Street to 48th Street. Now the organizer - Emilio Del Valle and the Latin American Kiwanis Club/Cuban Parade of New Jersey - will have to scramble and get approvals from North Bergen, Guttenberg and West New York. Guttenberg and North Bergen attorneys, who attended yesterday's hearing, said they were waiting for West New York's final decision before issuing permits. Lawyers for West New York claimed in court yesterday the permit was denied because the parade group falsely bills itself as a nonprofit company and called the parade a charitable fraud. Gallipoli said those claims must be brought to the proper agencies for review. "I respect the order of the judge," said Vega. "I will pursue what I consider to be the fraudulent nature of the parade committee through the proper authority as said by the judge, including the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office." Parade co-founder Emilio Del Valle said he will go to work on a new parade route, but it will still begin at 22nd Street in Union City. "(This has been) a tremendous ordeal from a mayor with something wrong in the head," said Del Valle. 32nd District Assembly candidates' profiles 2 teens attacked in Hoboken Announce arrests of 19 Latin Kings &copy; 2007 The Jersey Journal.

The American Civil Liberties Union claims Jeppesen, a 73-year-old company that offers a host of flight-planning and navigation services, provided support to at least 15 aircraft that made 70 flights to clandestine locations since December 2001. During those flights, suspects allegedly were stripped, blindfolded, chained down - one even made to wear a diaper. The ACLU says the suspects were tortured and subjected to other forms "of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment" at overseas locations under the CIA's so-called extraordinary rendition program. Officials at Jeppesen, a subsidiary of Boeing Co., had no immediate comment. The company, though, stressed that it doesn't provide flights and knows little about its clients' intentions. "We have thousands of customers who do tens of thousands of flights a day that we'll support with information in some fashion," said company spokesman Mike Pound. "There are some things we have to know, such as what route the airplane is going to take. But it isn't necessary to know why somebody is making a trip, and it is not our practice to ask." The Jeppesen name is familiar to many locals: Denver International Airport's main terminal is named after Elrey Jeppesen, who founded the company and was inducted into the Colorado Business Hall of Fame. The company provides everything from flight charts and weather data to training and software. It employs 1,400 in Colorado and has offices worldwide. Jeppesen has been linked to the covert CIA flights before. In 2006, an article in claimed Jeppesen regularly arranges CIA "spook" flights to overseas locations. The magazine quoted a former worker who said a top-level executive admitted that the company participates in the flights. Since then, peace activists and others have protested outside the company's offices in San Jose, Calif., home of Jeppesen's International Trip and Flight Planning Office, which is said to have organized the flights. ACLU attorney Ben Wizner said Jeppesen could not have been ignorant of the purpose of CIA flights. "Either they knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program," he said. Companies "are not allowed to have their head in the sand and take money from the CIA to fly people, hooded and shackled, to foreign countries to be tortured." The lawsuit says Jeppesen participated in everything from providing aircraft crew with weather, route information and hotel accommodations to facilitating customs clearance and securing landing permits from foreign governments. Jeppesen's parent, Chicago-based Boeing, is not named in the lawsuit. Boeing spokesman Tim Neale said company officials typically don't comment on lawsuits and had not seen this one, nor would they confirm the allegations that Jeppesen provided services to the CIA. "Jeppesen has a confidentiality clause with all its customers," he said. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District, does not name the CIA as a defendant. The Bush administration has insisted it receives guarantees of no torture from countries receiving terror suspects. Ralph Latimer persuaded the Denver City Council to name Denver International Airport's terminal after aviation legend Elrey Borge Jeppesen, who moved to the city in 1941 and was here until his death in 1996. Capt. Jeppesen was the first person to exit the first plane to land at DIA on the airport's opening day- Feb. 28, 1995. or 303-954-2744. Rocky wire services contributed to this report.

Most recent post in SLY N' CHIC PREMIER ISSUE &hellip; reader to stay up to date with the latest news and posts from Gothamist. Sonny Carson Battle in City Council Things got heated in the City Council yesterday as former Black Panther and Council Member Charles Barron against Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who had removed the name of Sonny Carson from a list of people to be honored with having streets named after them. Sonny Carson was an activist who railed against Korean grocers and, not wanting to limit himself to an accusation of anti-Semitism, said he was anti-white in general. Quinn feels that Carson was a divisive figure in New York's history and Barron thinks he was an important individual who united his community. Earlier this week Barron and a state Asemmblyman from Brooklyn Linden Park in Brooklyn "Sonny Abubadika Carson Park" despite the Parks Department's insistence that no such name change was going to be recognized. Barron said "This is official, because I am an official" and Mayor Bloomberg was quoted saying naming anything after Sonny Carson was one of the worst ideas in recent history. The Parks Department said that it would remove the signs that Barron had affixed around Linden Park and the Council Member promised to just keep putting more up. The bizarre park incident was the precursor to yesterday's Council event, which included a vote to amend the bill by re-adding Carson's name to the list of proposed street names. The event was not amicable, as the amendment failed 25-15 in the 51 member body. Barron's aide Viola Plummer heckled Quinn during the meeting and later vowed to end the career of Leroy Comrie, a black council member who abstained from voting on the amendment, using the term "assassinate him". No black council members voted against the amendment. It sounds like a racially acrimonious meeting and NY1 thinks that it could eventually injure Quinn's aspirations for higher office. (Photo of Charles Barron by Bebeto Matthews/AP) Advertisement: Gothamist Continues Below! Absolutely ridiculous. Let's honor racism by giving it a street name... Good for Quinn and the rest of the Council Members who have brains. Posted by: mcscatterbomb | AM Democracy may be the best form of government, but occasionally it fails - for example, when a moron like Barron is able to win an election. Posted by: Peter | AM Never Again, Now you will see. God bless you Charles Barron. This is only the beginning. Never again always forever. Posted by: never again always forever | AM "but occasionally it fails - for example, when a moron like Barron is able to win an election." I don't think it failed. The people have elected him. That's democracy. The fact that his constituents are racists is a different matter. Posted by: Stan LS | AM "never again always forever", could you please explain that? "Never Again" is most often associated with the Holocaust and seeing how Sonny Carson was "Anti White", I'm not making the connection... AM S.D. - Don't forget that he was Anti-Jewish and Anti-Korean too! Posted by: Jon | AM While Carson put his stance in ethnically-charged and prejudicial terms, the basic idea was "buy black," which is and always has been a legitimate form of economic activism for the black community. Before desegregation, we blacks largely patronized businesses owned and operated by other blacks because we had to; once we stopped having to, many of those businesses died, along with a sizable portion of our middle class. Black people are dying and dying out in this country -- economically, who's to blame for that? And don't start with that "well if you didn't buy sneakers instead of putting in the bank" bullshit. Posted by: matukonyc | AM Without disputing your facts about post-desegregation businesses, are you contending that segregation was actually good for blacks? I don't know who is to blame for why blacks are not doing as well economically but I have a hard time believing that it is due to desegregation. Posted by: tim | AM "who's to blame for that?" Blame the culture. Teenage pregnancies, children out of wedlock, lack of discipline, etc. I went to a public high school in brooklyn and the difference between american born blacks and that of recent carribean immigrants is pretty noticable. They acdtually respected the teachers, cared about their grades, etc. Posted by: Stan LS | AM It's Our Time now, Never Again Always Forever, look it up. Posted by: nevr again our time | AM Does the City Council have any kind of impeachment option? Posted by: Brightliner | AM let the people who use the park name it after whoever they want. Are Quin, Bloomberg or anyone who doesnt live in the immediate area actually going to visit it. No. Barron, like any other race baiter, wins the more the establishment complains about this non issue. Posted by: jb | AM Let's rename Atlantic Ave "Tookie Williams Boulevard." Posted by: DarnellRobinson | AM If you think teen pregnancy, lack of discipline, unwed mothers etc is only exclusive to one group, I have a bridge to sell you. Visit a WalMart below the mason dixon/washington beltway or west of Trenton and you'll see. You don't even have to go that far, there's these people everywhere, from Seldon LI to areas of trash in Rhode Island and Boston. Posted by: breakfast clubber | AM "If you think...", nice strawman, there. To me, people who live in projects are the same type of people who live in mobile homes. Posted by: Stan LS | AM one salient point to make about out of wedlock births is that the percentages for black and white women are not only radically difference, but the result is disproportionately heavy on black children (48% in poverty versus 11% for whites). this story touches on this: wanted to inject a factoid or two; enjoy the trolling! Never Again Always Forever sounds like a mountain dew slogan gone bad. Posted by: dhex | AM It's sad what the "civil rights" movement has devolved into. Sadder still that people like Barron make people like Sharpton seem almost professional by comparison. Posted by: Frog | AM breakfast clubber, I hate to actually bring, well, facts, into this debate, but the teen pregnancy rate among African Americans in New York State is more than 3x that of whites. Check out teenpregnancy dot org. Posted by: JustAGuy | AM If you say so. that's not what you wrote. your kids are healthy, right? Good. You love and teach them well. Posted by: skarekrow | AM Also, 2/3 of births to african-american women in NY in 2004 were out of wedlock, while only 20% of births to white women were. per cdc dot gov. Posted by: JustAGuy | AM I don't think it failed. The people have elected him. That's democracy. The fact that his constituents are racists is a different matter. You are quite correct. Democracy did not fail - it produced a bad result, but that is not the same thing as failure. Posted by: Peter | AM frog, you may be missing the point of barron and sharpton, etc. they serve a niche that exists because of the accidents and incidents of history, just like any other politico. their rhetoric just happens to be sharper. they're also drawing on a historical current that goes back, at least in new york, to the days of marcus garvey before the great splintering. that's a hell of a long time. one of those splinters, btw, became the various "lost tribes" groups, one variation you can still see in times square. i recommend listening for a while because it is a fascinating peek into a culture which has retained physiological presumptions about race that date back to the end of the high water mark for eugenics in the united states. Posted by: dhex | AM a poster mentioned the unwed births by race, that's the entire country. show me where is it that black teens are having more births out of wedlock for the entire U.S.? ever been to West Virginia? take a drive through there on your way to chicago. Or, maybe it's just the white girls who just throw their just born baby in the dumpster before going to the prom, look that up. Posted by: nyc the capital of the world | PM Barron is ridiculous.

The anger over Republican House Speaker Tom Craddicks treatment of House rules has been brewing for some time. Early Monday morning, nearly 60 lawmakers walked out of the chamber after Craddick refused to allow a vote on whether he should remain the speaker. The walkout broke a quorum and forced the House to adjourn. This man is sitting here violating every rule of the House, every rule of parliamentary procedure to keep himself in office, and its wrong, said Rep. Pat Haggerty, R-El Paso. House Democratic leader Jim Dunnam of Waco said, Weve had enough. This was not the first objection to Craddicks leadership. In January, he won a challenge by fellow Republican Jim Pitts of Waxahachie. Alexis DeLee, a spokeswoman for Mr. Craddick, released a written statement criticizing the walkout as politics. Once again, some members chose to divert the House away from important matters and instead tried to drag the members into a speakers race while we are in session. The 140-day legislative session is scheduled through the end of the day on Monday. It appeared the Speaker had held onto his position as members returned to the chamber, after an appeal by Governor Perry to rise above their differences and finish the work of the people of Texas. Craddicks two-year term does not expire until the next legislative session convenes, in January 2009. Already, five Republicans have said they will be running against him. Whomever the next speaker turns out to be, they will most likely find that the House rules have been rewritten. Burt Solomons, the Chairman of the Financial Institution, and the person who carried House rules through its ratification in January, said it was never the intent of the rules to give the speaker absolute authority. He promised that the rules would be revised so that the next speaker would not be able to claim the amount of power Craddick has. Information from the Associated Press, Reuters, and the Dallas Morning News was used in this report. on May 28 2007 18:15:21 on May 28 2007 21:09:45 I am amused by this story, since the Republicans want to remove their own Speaker. I wonder, if it is not one man&#39;s failure to lead or indicative of other problems. Please Login to Post a Comment. Rating is available to Members only. Please login or register to vote.

View 7 days > Thursday, past must be faced - and recognized for how recent it is Twenty-five years ago, someone near and dear to me disappeared. Was he a victim of foul play? Did he bump his head and lose all memory? Or did he just decide to pursue new beginnings somewhere else, unburdened by a wife and a family? After a quarter of a century, I'm beginning to accept that I will never know what happened. Still, the last thing I want is for someone to say, "Forget about it. Move on!" I've moved on. But forget? Never. Most people, when someone close disappears or dies mysteriously, never get over it. Thomas Moore never got over his brother's murder in Mississippi in 1964, and he never stopped hoping that justice would rain down on those responsible. Earlier this year, James Ford Seale, 71, a Klansman, was indicted on federal kidnapping and conspiracy charges in connection with the murders of Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee. According to the FBI, the two 19-year-olds were hitchhiking in Mississippi when Klansmen picked them up and took them to the Homochitto National Forest. They were severely beaten, dumped into the trunk of a car and driven to Louisiana, where they were weighted down, thrown into the Mississippi River and left to drown. Seale was first arrested in November 1964, but the charges were eventually dropped, and the two young men's deaths were all but forgotten. "We didn't have money to solicit help from attorneys, so the old saying is, we just had to eat it up," Thomas Moore said in Kathy Lohr's "Morning Edition" report on National Public Radio this week. But while the taste of what Moore's family had to "eat" is bitter, he has gotten relief that others similarly positioned never have. He's lived to see this week the selection of jurors who may finally bring a scoundrel to justice. This case is one of many investigations reopened in the so-called Civil Rights Era Cold Case Initiative in which the U.S. Justice Department, modern Southern prosecutors and civil rights organizations are working together. The Southern Poverty Law Center, in fact, has compiled a list of more than 70 men and women who died between 1952 and 1968 "under circumstances suggesting they were the victims of racially motivated violence." The victims were tortured and killed in a variety of ways; they were shot, burned alive, hanged, beaten, strangled, castrated, mutilated, drowned or denied needed medical treatment. A civil rights activist recently remarked that with white supremacy being "the " in Mississippi, "to some people it was just sport to go out and harass and kill black people." Timothy B. Tyson, a white Southerner, would agree. Blood Done Sign My Name , the winner of this year's University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion wrote, "I don't know when I first became infected with white supremacy. But when I was no more than 6 years old, I discovered within myself both that monstrous lie and the moral cowardice necessary to its preservation." Ancient history? Hardly. Tyson was born in 1959. His book was inspired by the 1970 murder of Henry Marrow, a 23-year-old black veteran who was "killed in public as he lay on his back, helpless, begging for his life." And what burned Marrow's murder into Tyson's consciousness was a childhood friend saying to him, "Daddy and Roger and 'em shot 'em a nigger." "Many individuals have quite literally gotten away with murder," FBI Director Robert Mueller III has said. He warned those still alive, however, "We're still on your trail." This is a badly needed response to the people who live in what I call the honky-dory nation -- that place where everything is cool, where talk about unpleasant things simply is not allowed and where people say that no good comes from opening old wounds. All that comes from sweeping unpleasant incidents under the rug is a lumpy rug. Facing up to the past, including the bad, is the only way individuals and nations can heal. Betty Winston Bayé's columns appear Thursdays. Her e-mail address is I wasn't even born in 1960. What I see today FOR THE MOST PART is black and white people coexisting fairly and FOR THE MOST PART treating each other with respect. The last business dealing I had was with a mixed couple. That doesn't make for exciting journalism, though, does it? You can keep dwelling and bemoaning the items of injustice (for which this writer or your readers are not responsible) or you can realize it was a different time in this nation and be happy how far we have come in 45 years. How much more progress will come in the future? Do you want to be a part of that? Or, do you want to provide a reason for otherwise harmonious casual and personal relationships to feel strain because of something long ago we can't do anything about and had nothing to do with? Your paycheck must be more important than progress. Posted: Thu am Subscribe to the newspaper Copyright 2005 The Courier-Journal.

See a photo you want? Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, on Thu, May. 31, 2007 Justice is widening its probe to other hirings WASHINGTON - An internal Justice Department investigation into the firing of eight federal prosecutors has broadened to examine whether the department used political considerations in hiring career employees for its Civil Rights Division. Glenn Fine, the department&#0039;s inspector general, and H. Marshall Jarrett, head of the Office of Professional Responsibility, told the House and Senate Judiciary Committees in a letter yesterday that the review also would focus on hiring for the department&#0039;s honors program for entry-level attorneys and on summer internships. The expansion followed the May 23 acknowledgment by the department&#0039;s former White House liaison, Monica Goodling, that she had "crossed the line" by inquiring into the party affiliations of people applying for nonpolitical jobs. Fine and Jarrett said they were looking at "allegations regarding Goodling&#0039;s and others&#0039; actions" in hiring and personnel decisions. The Justice Department began investigating in March to assess whether the U.S. attorneys had been fired for improper reasons, such as a way to meddle in cases, and whether department officials had misled Congress when testifying. Both Judiciary Committees are also probing the firings and the White House&#0039;s role in them. On May 2, the Justice Department disclosed that investigators also would probe whether Goodling had relied on improper political considerations in reviewing the applications of people seeking to become assistant U.S. attorneys. Last year&#0039;s firings touched off a political furor over Attorney General Alberto Gonzales&#0039; management of the department and his close ties to President Bush. Many Democrats and several Republicans have called for Gonzales&#0039; ouster, although Bush has repeatedly expressed support for him. Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D., Vt.) said in a statement that he welcomed the expanded review. Goodling, who quit in April, told the House Judiciary Committee under a grant of limited immunity that she sometimes considered lawyers&#0039; political views when reviewing them for positions as immigration judges or assistant U.S. attorneys. Both jobs are covered by civil-service laws barring such assessments.

Lindsay Caruso was shopping at a health food store on Broadway when she saw a commotion in front of Broadway Grill and walked over to check it out. At 11 a.m., both women were stationed in front of the restaurant, along with their babies, waiting to get a glimpse of former New York mayor and Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, who was scheduled to show up at any minute. By that time, owner Nick Bovis had been at the restaurant for about an hour. He stopped by the table of "New York" Nick Fleres, a general contractor who eats at the grill four or five times a week, and told him to leave the seat next to him open, because Giuliani might be taking it. Bovis had first heard from Giuliani's campaign late last week. A campaign manager called and told him that Giuliani was "looking for a place he could come and meet regular people" before heading to a fundraiser at the Burlingame Hyatt, Bovis said. Campaign operatives in the Bay Area recommended the grill, which opened in December, in part because of its New York-centered theme and decor, said Giuliani spokesman Jarrod Agen. As 11 o'clock neared, Bovis positioned himself near the front door. By his feet was a framed, autographed photo of famed New York Yankee slugger Joe DiMaggio that he planned to present to Giuliani, a devoted Yankees fan. Bovis, who also owns Lefty O'Doul's in San Francisco,laughed and said he doesn't know much about politics, but Giuliani struck him as a "common-sense, middle-of-the-road" candidate. "If he can clean up New York, he can clean up the United States," he added. Giuliani stepped out of his car shortly after 11 a.m. and onto the Broadway sidewalk, where he was accosted by a scrum of reporters and cameramen. He assured them he'd speak to them after the event and made his way to the door, where Bovis greeted him. Bovis showed him the photo of DiMaggio once they were inside. "Oh, look at that!" Giuliani said, smiling and clapping his hands together. "It's beautiful. Thank you." Giuliani then made his way around the restaurant, shaking hands and signing autographs. Eventually, the candidate took a seat next to Fleres and several other customers at a table in the middle of the room, toasting them with a glass of orange juice. They talked about baseball, taxes, health care and children, Flores recalled afterward. "I think he's genuine," said Fleres, who grew up in New York City's Greenwich Village neighborhood. "He looks at you when he speaks (and he's) very bright and very poised." Giuliani supporters at the Grill said the mayor made a strong and favorable impression on them in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. "There's a safety about him," said Ana Cisneros, one of the managers of the restaurant, who was working as a United Airlines flight attendant on 9/11. "Something about him is just warm and genuine." Carlos Alferez, a pastor from San Jose who drove up for breakfast at Bovis' invitation, said he was eager to learn more about the candidate. "The most that I know about him is after the 9/11 (attacks) he really held the city together," said Alferez, seated across from his wife, Maxine. "And the people there really respected him." As Giuliani walked out of the grill, Borrolaza and Caruso positioned themselves along the sidewalk, hoping for an introduction. But the candidate was distracted by a well-wisher to his right and went by without seeing them. Giuliani took questions from reporters on the corner of Broadway and Capuchino Avenue, then turned around to find his car. This time the two mothers got his attention. He shook Borrolaza's hand, though he didn't notice 11-month-old Kasen, and moved on to Caruso, who held her 3-month-old son, Daniel, out for him to greet. "Of course I'll say hi to your kid," said Giuliani, bending down to give the child a kiss on the forehead. "Well, at least I got to shake his hand," said Borroloza after the Republican front-runner had gotten into his car. "Baby didn't get kissed, but he won't remember." "Danny, Danny!" Caruso explained to her son. "You got kissed by Mayor Giuliani!" Staff writer Aaron Kinney can be reached at (650) 348-4302 or Comment on this article by clicking on the link below.

"I think the way a Republican should run is toward the future," the former New York City mayor told reporters at the Broadway Grill, where he signed autographs and chatted it up with customers. He criticized Clinton's proposal - which she pitched Tuesday in New Hampshire - to let President Bush's tax cuts for top earners expire. He supports eliminating the estate tax and reducing the capital gains tax. Playing to his audience, Giuliani said higher taxes would mean less venture capital for the high-technology industries that keep the Bay Area's economy afloat. There's "a dramatic difference ... between a philosophy of more government" espoused by Clinton and Democrat Barack Obama and his own support for "lower taxes, less government Giuliani then headed to a birthday-celebration fundraiser, heavy with Silicon Valley venture capitalists and corporate executives, at the Burlingame Hyatt. Tickets cost up to &#36;2,300, with the top price bringing a VIP reception and photo op with the candidate. From there, he was heading to a similar event in Beverly Hills. Nick Bovis, the owner of the downtown Burlingame eatery, presented Giuliani with an autographed photo of New York Yankee legend Joe DiMaggio. "We want you to redecorate the White House," Bovis told him. He signed a copy of the U.S. Constitution for local campaign coordinator Vic Marani, 47, of Santa Cruz, and accepted a &#36;200 campaign contribution check from George Yerby, 67, of Hillsborough; Giuliani quipped it might have been "the first time I think one's been given directly to me." Yerby, who said he's semi-retired from real estate, said Giuliani's policies are "perfect for this area. ... He's going to be the next president." After a slow circuit of the restaurant, Giuliani, with a cup of coffee in hand, took a seat between regulars Mike DeMaria and Nicholas Fleres, both of whom described themselves as "New York Italians." The conversation ranged from the Yankees to California's early primary to immigration policy. On the latter, Giuliani said he doesn't support the plan drawn up by the Senate and Bush, in part because it doesn't include issuing tamper-proof ID cards or require a database of all foreigners entering and leaving the country. Bob Mayer, 56, a self-employed wholesaler from Millbrae, said he supports Giuliani for precisely this reason. "It's not a time to quibble over abortion or to quibble about gay marriage," Mayer said. Immigration, border security and homeland security are paramount, he said. "Everything else is just window-dressing." On the way to his waiting car, Giuliani kissed the forehead of 11-month-old Daniel Caruso of Burlingame, whose mother, Lindsay Caruso, 30, said they had been out for a walk and stopped to see what all the hubbub was about. "I don't know a ton about him at this point," she said of Giuliani. "But I'm interested, definitely, and learning more." Contact Josh Richman at jrichman@angnewspapers.com or (510) 208-6428.

Thursday, &mdash; The Justice Department said Wednesday that it has expanded its internal inquiry on the firing of U.S. attorneys into whether politics played a part in hiring career prosecutors. In a rare note updating lawmakers on its investigation, the department said it also was looking into hiring practices within its civil rights division. Lawmakers have questioned whether the division has hired prosecutors with strong political r&eacute;sum&eacute;s but little civil rights experience.

Doing so is illegal. The short letter, signed by Justice Inspector General Glenn Fine and Office of Professional Responsibility counsel H. Marshall Jarrett, widens the inquiry into hiring practices in at least three areas, including: &#8226;Those by Goodling and other Justice officials. &#8226;The Civil Rights division. &#8226;The department's honors programs and summer law intern positions. Critics say the honors program, which has long been filled with graduates of prestigious law schools, has been opened to applicants with mostly political credentials. Justice officials say the applicants are all reviewed by an outside committee before they are hired by the deputy attorney general's office. Democrats Patrick Leahy of Vermont and John Conyers of Michigan, chairmen of the Senate and House panels, respectively, said the allegations show the need for greater oversight at the Justice Department. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called anew for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign.

He described his proposal, which has been accepted by a bipartisan group of senators, as one that makes it more likely we can enforce our border and at the same time uphold the great immigrant tradition of the United States of America. Bush spoke at the nations largest training centre for law enforcement. He chose the get-tough setting as a counter to conservative critics ferocious denunciation of a Senate proposal as being soft on people who break the law. Hoping to blunt that message, Bush emphasised that any new options for immigrants and foreign workers would not start until tougher security is in place. The presidential stop came during a congressional recess, with senators back home and facing pressure from both left and right on the immigration plan. © Thomas Crosbie Media 2007.

Bush takes aim at GOP critics of immigration deal Says conservatives use scare tactics, 'haven't read bill' President Bush's trip to Georgia opened a campaign intended to undercut the criticism that has consumed conservative talk shows and Internet sites, and educate the public. (Oscar Sosa/Bloomberg News) By Peter Baker, Washington Post | GLYNCO, Ga. -- President Bush lashed out at critics within his own party yesterday, accusing Republican opponents of distorting the immigration deal he negotiated with leading congressional Democrats and playing on the politics of fear to undermine public support. In harsh tones normally reserved for the liberal opposition, Bush said conservatives fighting the immigration proposal "haven't read the bill" and oppose it in some cases because "it might make somebody else look good." Their "empty political rhetoric," he said, threatens to thwart what he called the last, best chance to fix an immigration system that all sides agree is broken. "If you want to kill the bill, if you don't want to do what's right for America, you can pick out one little aspect out of it," he told thousands of trainees at a federal center here that prepares Border Patrol officers. "You can use it to frighten people. Or you can show leadership and solve this problem once and for all, so the people who wear the uniform in this crowd can do the job we expect them to do." The president's rhetoric underscored the bitter crossfire among Republicans over immigration and the enormous challenge Bush faces in trying to rally his party behind what may be the most significant domestic initiative left in his presidency. The White House has been pressing conservatives to fall in line, sending emissaries to meet with lawmakers and activists, but many on Capitol Hill and on the presidential campaign trail have ignored the administration's pleadings and rushed to denounce the deal. Although the proposal has the support of key Democrats, most notably Senator Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, the White House recognizes that its chances of pushing it through depend on winning enough Republican support. Bush's trip to Georgia opened a campaign intended to undercut the criticism that has consumed conservative talk shows and Internet sites, and educate the public about a complicated bill. But conservatives bristled at his remarks. "I don't think name-calling does any good at this point," said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. "What they've done from the very beginning is say, `This is the way we want it done and anyone who disagrees with us is outside the mainstream.' . . . It's been badly handled. They'll be lucky, given the attitudes in the country, to come up with anything." Brian Darling, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said he and his colleagues not only have read the bill but posted it on the think tank's website . "Most conservatives have very strong feelings that this bill contains amnesty . . . and no yelling and screaming by the administration is going to change our minds," he said. As for the charge of scare tactics, Darling said: "Honestly, I really think people should be frightened. This bill would be the most dramatic change to immigration law in 40 years and no one seems to understand what's in the bill. . . . The American people should be frightened by the closed-door process that was used and by the ramifications." The proposal would beef up enforcement with thousands more Border Patrol agents and hundreds of miles of more fencing along the line with Mexico. After that has been accomplished, in an estimated 18 months, the legislation would introduce a guest-worker program, allowing some immigrants into the country temporarily, and create a process providing many of the 12 million illegal immigrants already here a chance to earn legal residency if they pay back taxes and penalties, pass criminal background checks, and return first to their country of origin. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Pu, an eighth-grader from Auburn, was No. 277 of 286 spellers in this year's bee, which forced him to wait on stage for 45 minutes during Round 2 and nearly two hours for round three while others faced the ultimate challenge in spelling. Pu made it to the third round Wednesday but tripped on the word "rambla," which means dry ravine. Pu, who admitted he wasn't familiar with the word, spelled it "rombla." The disappointing end was in direct contrast to his strong and confident performance earlier in the day. Despite waiting for nearly 100 spellers to finish in round two, Pu didn't waste any time when his name was called. He stepped to the microphone. He heard the word, asked for a definition then barely hesitated before correctly spelling "shindig." The success pushed him through to the third round of the nation's premier -- and most difficult -- spelling competition and a step closer to a grand prize of $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. He was in the third round with 106 other spellers, along with much tougher words and immense pressure. All 107 qualified by scoring high enough on a 25-word written test and spelling a word to a large audience. Pu admitted the wait was tough. "It's true. Because you're waiting for your turn and you don't really pay much attention to the other people, and then when it's your turn, you get really nervous," said Pu, who attends Federal Way Public Academy. He was sponsored by the Seattle P-I. In past years, spellers from Washington state have grown apprehensive as they watch competitors spell easy words. The fear, they have said, is that the quota of manageable words will end, leaving them with brutally difficult words. Pu had no such thoughts: "I like to think optimistically." Pu wasn't the only one who breezed through the early rounds only to fall in round three. The round eliminated 13 of the 107 who began. With more free time than expected, Pu said he will watch the bee, go sightseeing in Washington, D.C., and concentrate on one other goal. "I want to convince my sister to start spelling," he said. The oral round was hardly taxing for the top spellers. Tia Thomas, 12, of Coarsegold, Calif., back for her fourth national bee, correctly spelled "flagrant." The audience laughed when pronouncer Jacques Bailly defined "ninety" as "being one more than 89" for 13-year-old Mary Harrington of Vineyard Haven, Mass. Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kan., made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever when correctly spelling "enumerated." Kate Weir, 13, of Christchurch, New Zealand, traveled far to participate, and she must have thought the wait was even longer when she was kept at the microphone while the judges conferred over her Kiwi-accented spelling of "eeriness." Her spelling was eventually declared correct. The bee concludes Thursday night with the champion being crowned during a prime-time broadcast.

He was assigned to the 2-6 Calvary Squadron at Schofield Barracks. AP Photo/The Norwich Bulletin Chief Warrant Officer Theodore U. Church, 32, of Ohio, was also killed in Monday's crash in Iraq. He was also based at Schofield. Two soldiers who were assigned to the 2-6 Calvary Squadron at Schofield Barracks were among the 10 soldiers killed in Iraq on Memorial Day, the Department of Defense announced today. 1st Lt. Keith N. Heidtman, 24, of Norwich, Conn., and Chief Warrant Officer Theodore U. Church, 32, of Ohio, died Monday in Muqdadiyah, Iraq, when their OH-58D Kiowa helicopter crashed after receiving heavy enemy fire during combat operations, the DOD said. They were assigned to the 2nd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, 25th Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division. Heidtman was the 37th military member with Connecticut ties to die since the war began in 2002. Two Connecticut civilians have also been killed. "It's all a shock to us," said Chris Heidtman, the soldier's uncle. His parents were notified Tuesday morning. He was the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux. His stepfather is Art Robidoux. A Norwich Bulletin article quoted Heidtman's stepfather on the loss of their son: "The family, while devastated by the loss, is proud of his service to the country. His perspective on life was pretty good. He had focus. He had drive. He did what he thought he could do best. He died for it." MAY IS THIRD-DEADLIEST MONTH OF WAR FOR U.S TROOPS As of late Tuesday, there were 113 U.S. deaths in Iraq so far in May &#151; trailing only the 137 in November 2004 and the 135 in April 2004. Eight of the soldiers were from Task Force Lightning &#151; six killed when explosions hit near their vehicles and two in a helicopter crash. Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believes the aircraft was brought down by small arms fire, and that the roadside bomb that killed a response team headed to the crash site was not the newer, armor piercing explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs, that have killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers. Speaking to Pentagon reporters, Wiggins called the assault a "complex attack." But he also said the military continues to "adjust our flight maneuvering and our routes in order to not become predictable and in order to make it more difficult" for the enemy. 'THIS IS WHO YOU WOULD PICK' FOR YOUR SON Heidtman was a 2001 graduate of Norwich Free Academy and a graduate of the University of Connecticut. "If you had to pick your son, this is who you would pick. He was handsome, he was bright," Chris Heidtman said. Heidtman arrived in Iraq in December and was scheduled to come home for leave in July. "We're sending our finest, and we're losing them," Chris Heidtman said. Connecticut Gov. M. Jodi Rell ordered all state and U.S. flags lowered to half-staff in Heidtman's honor. "Lt. Heidtman made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, and he did so to protect the freedom that we so often take for granted," Rell said in a statement. "To have given his life on Memorial Day is especially poignant." Funeral arrangements have not been announced. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Get a look behind the scenes at New York politics and statewide campaigns here. New York Stays Blue But Reds Like Rudy 10:46 am by Rick Karlin New York remains overwhelmingly Democratic in the latest Siena Research Institute poll , with Dems getting at least 50 percent of the vote in any presidential matchups.For example, New Yorkers prefer Hillary Clinton over Rudy Giuliani by a 52-39 percent margin and Hillary trumps McCain 54 to 36.Barack Obama beats Giuliani 50 to 40 and McCain by a 50 to 33 percent margin. Al Gore would whip Fred Thompson 56 to 28 with Hillary beating him 57 to 29. New York has been a blue state since 1988 and poll spokesman Steve Greenberg says there&#8217;s no reason to think that will change. Among Republicans, though, Giuliani is way ahead in New York crushing McCain, his closest contender 52-14. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if Rudy faces 10 opponents or just four. Either way he wins big,'&#8217; said Greenberg. &#8220;New York has been a blue state since 1988&#8243; Are we better off now than we were in 1988? Comment by Ed Rooney &#8212; Comment by Andrew C.

The blue chip company has allegedly been involved with the Central Intelligence Agency with âthe forced disappearance, torture and inhumane treatmentâ of three men suspected of being terrorists. According to the suit, âPublicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standardsâ. The three men on behalf of whom the suit was brought includes Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian, who was allegedly mistreated in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and subjected to torture in May 2002 and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian who, while seeking asylum in Sweden was arrested by Swedish police and handed over to the CIA, underwent torture in December 2001. While Mohamed is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Britel is being held in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt. Mike pound, a spokesperson for Jeppesen has said, âThere isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for themâ. Boeingâs representative Timothy Neale has commented, âWe have not gotten the lawsuit yet, so we are not commenting on it. We are not confirming the reports that Jeppesen did work for the CIA. The services Jeppesen provides are provided on a confidential basis for all its customers.â The suit alleges that the detainees were taken to countries where they underwent inhumane, degrading treatment and torture since they were beyond the reach of the law. The suit also states that Jeppesen provided services to the flight and crew used in the rendition program âto unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistanâ. The suspects were apprehended under the U.S. government's âextraordinary rendition programâ. Extraordinary rendition is the clandestine capture and transfer of suspects to be detained and interrogated in countries where the protection of U.S. laws does not apply, said Ben Wizner, an ACLU attorney. He also said that âEither they knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program.â The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

The South Florida Water Management District reported today a record low of just under nine feet, surpassing the mark set during a 2001 drought. The region's drought is leading water managers to assess how to best protect drinking water supplies, meet needs of the important agriculture industry and protect natural resources. The average water level should be around 13 feet this time of year in the second-largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. The record low is the result of months of lower-than-normal rainfall levels that have afflicted the main backup water supply for 5 million South Florida residents. Lake Okeechobee is also the liquid heart of the Everglades. . The Associated Press contributed to this report. All rights reserved.

Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, died Monday when an improvised explosive device detonated near his position during a "dismounted patrol" in Baghdad, according to a statement issued by officials at Fort Lewis, Wash., where McFall was based. Also killed in the blast was 20-year-old Cpl. Junior Cedeno Sanchez of Miami. The two soldiers were assigned to the Stryker Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. Records indicate that McFall's family lived on the 1300 block of Westridge Avenue in Glendora in the early 1990s. But McFall's wife, Emily McFall, said he always considered Riverside home. "He joined the service quite awhile ago, in 1994; he never mentioned Glendora," said Emily McFall. Emily McFall said her husband leaves behind a son and two daughters. "Somehow, he always took over the barbecue, even if it was someone else's house," read the statement.

In a court filing today, Patrick Fitzgerald provides a summary of Valerie Plame Wilson's status with the CIA's Counterproliferation Division at the time she was outed to the press by members of the Bush administration. Guess what? While assigned to CPD, Ms. Wilson engaged in temporary duty (TDY) travel overseas on official business. She traveled at least seven times to more than ten countries. When traveling overseas, Ms. Wilson always traveled under a cover identity &#151 sometimes in true name and sometimes in alias &#151 but always using cover &#151 whether official or non-official cover (NOC) &#151 with no ostensible relationship to the CIA. At the time of the initial unauthorized disclosure in the media of Ms. Wilson's employment relationship with the CIA on 14 July 2003, Ms. Wilson was a covert employee for whom the CIA was taking affirmative measures to conceal her intelligence relationship to the United States. So that settles that. I hope the wingosphere can finally stop bleating about how she wasn't "really" covert and there was no harm in what Libby et. al. did. On another note, this probably means I was wrong about the reason Fitzgerald didn't try to prosecute anyone for leaking Plame's name. (Libby was tried only for perjury, not for outing a covert agent.) I figured it was because Plame had been working inside the U.S. for six years at the time of the leak, and one of the technical elements of "covert" under the IIPA Act is that the agent has "within the last five years served outside the United States." been working under cover outside the U.S. quite extensively during the previous five years, which means that Plame almost certainly qualified as "covert" under the specific definitions outlined in IIPA. Nonetheless, for some reason Fitzgerald decided not to bring outing charges against anyone. This suggests that Mark Kleiman has been right all along: Fitzgerald's decision had nothing to do with technical aspects of IIPA, but rather with its requirements. That is, the leakers had to that leaking Plame's name could be damaging, and Fitzgerald didn't think he had the evidence to make that case. That might have been especially true since the leaks seem to have been authorized at very high levels, something the leakers could have used in their defense at trial. Anyway, it's still a bit of a mystery. But we're a tiny step closer to understanding it.

In her open resignation letter on the Daily Kos, she says, "Good-bye America ...you are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it." Her "Goodbye America" is a switch from what she said less than a year ago. She previously said, "I could leave if I wanted to and, in fact, have received many offers to be an ex-patriot in many friendly countries. However, I want to stay and fight for my country." Sheehan says the Peace Movement is bad, the political parties are bad, and everyone who spoke against her are "narrow-minded." Well, Seems the one thing all of them have in common now is that they don't want Sheehan around. So, she did get rivals to agree. The problem with Sheehan is that her cause got distorted. She made it a show by aligning herself with some of the worst people she could find. How President Hugo Chavez got involved in her cause leaves one to wonder. He makes leftist Americans seem tame. He is the protégé of Fidel Castro, and she thought it was ok to have a meeting with him; a meeting that could be considered almost treasonous. Her resignation letter blames everybody for her decision to leave the limelight, but the reality is people were no longer supporting her. The Anti-war cause has supporters, but her as the spokesperson was becoming a liability. She said, "I renounced any tie I have remaining with the Democratic Party, I have been further trashed on such "liberal blogs" as the Democratic Underground. Being called an "attention whore" and being told "good riddance" are some of the more milder rebukes." The Democratic Underground has made an official letter calling for her to stay, and saying that she should be able to take some criticism as a public figure. Apparently not, since she was doing this all for her son. It is like the get out of jail free card. She claims that America killed her son, but what did she do to his legacy? Instead of letting him be the hero, she made him into a cause and then quit. Whether she really really leaves or not is immaterial, because to the hundreds of parents out there who lost children in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, she gave the ultimate insult. She said it was for "nothing" which is a lie straight from the pit of hell. I like being eclectic. I can enjoy many of the greats most people my age never heard of or stopped listening to like Elie Wiesel or Dr. Maya Angelou. They were the ones who taught me that even in the midst of discrimination, loss, or whatever life throws at you , that I could rise above it. Delores has earned a B.S. degree from Lee University and a Diploma of Practical Theology from Christ for the Nations Institute.

The vote, along racial lines, was 15 in favor and 25 against, with seven abstentions. Al Vann, the amendment&#39;s sponsor, made a 23-minute appeal to his colleagues that touched on the nation&#39;s legacy of slavery and racial injustice. Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn) clashed with Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum when he exceeded his allotted two minutes of floor time. Refusing to stop speaking, Barron pointed at Council Speaker Christine Quinn and blasted her as a hypocrite. "You brought us to a place of divide that this City Council has never experienced. You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever divided any people," he charged, pointing his finger at her. Quinn&#39;s staff was so miffed, her aides went over and turned off the microphones. "We&#39;re not voting on the civil- rights movement . . . we&#39;re voting on a person . . . who has been a representative of black separatism," said Oliver Koppell (D-Bronx). Carson, who died at age 66 in 2002, infamously led a boycott of Korean delis in Brooklyn in 1990.

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was the first to touch down. Attending a hotel fundraiser and mingling at a Bur- lingame diner Wednesday, he declared himself "the one Republican candidate with a legitimate chance to win California," and assailed the tax policies of Democratic contender Hillary Rodham Clinton as a threat to the high-tech economy. Hours later Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards turned up at Google for a town hall meeting. "America is increasingly divided by income and wealth," Edwards told employees at the company's Mountain View offices. "And that gap is not good. It's not healthy for this country." He pledged to increase average Americans' access to the Internet by expanding cost-effective broadband technology to "create as much openness and democracy as we can" online. Sen. Clinton, D-N.Y., who Wednesday picked up the endorsement of Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, will travel to Santa Clara today to address computer industry executives at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. Later, Clinton will head to Sacramento for a private fundraiser at the Rancho Cordova home of real estate developer Eleni Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis. The trio of scheduled appearances in Silicon Valley in less than 24 hours underscored candidates' competition for the hearts -- and dollars -- of California's venture capitalists, Internet entrepreneurs and technology innovators. With Silicon Valley decidedly in play, presidential contenders of both major political parties are lining up contributors and endorsements and chasing high-tech support. Giuliani met with voters at the art deco Broadway Grill in Burlingame before being feted by 200 donors at a nearby Hyatt Hotel fundraiser led by prominent Saratoga venture capitalist Floyd Kwamme. Giuliani declared himself a rare Republican who can win in blue state California. "I'm here as a candidate because I can help make California competitive in the general election," he said. Meeting later with reporters, Giuliani lit into Clinton for proposing increases in capital gains taxes and a rollback of President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy. He charged that her plan would harm business growth in Silicon Valley. "It would hurt our economy. It would hurt this area traumatically," Giuliani said. "That kind of tax increase would see a decline in your venture capital. It would see a decline in your ability to focus on new technologies and new development. These are massive tax increases that Mrs. Clinton is proposing." Clinton, campaigning Tuesday in New Hampshire, charged that Bush's tax cuts have primarily benefited the richest Americans while doing little to help middle-class families. She vowed to eliminate tax breaks that reward companies for moving jobs overseas, to cut back on subsidies for oil companies and to expand the earned-income tax credit to reduce poverty. As Giuliani was criticizing Clinton in Burlingame, she was in Los Angeles locking up one of California's most sought-after Democratic endorsements. Villaraigosa, the popular mayor and a leading Latino political figure, announced his endorsement after Clinton toured UCLA's Krieger Center preschool to tout her plan to make preschool available for all children in America. "Her depth and breadth of experience is unmatched, and I'm confident she will be the kind of partner our cities and towns need from the federal government," Villaraigosa said in his endorsement. The New York senator is to appear today at a Silicon Valley "Business Climate Summit" hosted by chief executives including Bruce Chizen of Adobe, Bill Watkins of Seagate Technologies and Mike Splinter of Applied Materials. Before the Google audience, Edwards declared that eliminating poverty "is going to require all of us to take responsibility for a huge moral issue in this country." He also encouraged the high-tech work force to make commitments to resolve "a crisis in climate change" by changing driving and consumption habits. Meanwhile, Edwards, who has made several fundraising trips to Silicon Valley, has picked up the backing of venture capitalists including Andrew Rappaport and former Google engineer David desJardins. Edwards told the crowd he would like to take the influence of money out of politics and advocated public financing of elections. "I'm not holier than thou on this," Edwards said. "But that doesn't mean I believe the system is good," he added later. "I think we need a president who says he is committed to the way we raise political contributions in this country."

When he is sentenced this coming Tuesday, Scooter Libby may be sent directly to jail. If so, this would be grossly unfair sinceÂ he stands an excellent chance of being acquitted on appeal.Â But it would also be the moment for President Bush to pardon him immediately. Back in March, when he was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice by a jury in federal court in Washington D.C., I why I thought the case ârepresents a terrible injustice.â The federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, had insisted to both the public andÂ the jury that the disclosure of the identity of the CIA operative Valerie Plameâwhich was the underlying actionÂ heÂ had beenÂ appointed to investigateâwas in fact a crime. But this was a point that had never been established or even formally alleged.Â Fitzgeraldâs overreaching onÂ this colored the juryâs thinking about the gravity of the issues at stake, suggested a motive for Libby to lie that did not reside in proved facts, and conflicted with the judgeâs ruling that the case would hinge on Plameâs status. Now Fitzgerald has been back in court, that when Libby is sentenced on Tuesday, the judge should throw the book at him precisely on the grounds that he committed the underlying crime-that-was-not-a-crime. Fitzgerald approvingly cites Judge David S. Tatelâs ruling in the Judith Miller case that âbecause the charges contemplated hereÂ relate to false denials of responsibility for Plameâs exposure, prosecuting perjury or false statements would be tantamount to punishing the leak.â But this a vicious circle. Convicted on the basis of something that was never proved or even formally alleged, is Libby now to be punished on the same basis? With Fitzgerald continuing to overreach, the case for a presidential pardon is growing stronger by the day. If Libby is imprisoned, will Bush do the right thing? Meanwhile, in closely related news, Senator Kit Bond of Missouri, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence, wants the committee to re-interview Valerie Plame. Back in March, inÂ a dispatch entitled Lying Liars and Their Lies , I asked whether Plame was under oath when she testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and declared that she played no role in sending her husband, Ambassador Joseph Wilson, on a fact-finding trip to Niger. âI did not recommend him. I did not suggest him. There was no nepotism involved. I did not have the authority,â she said. under oath, and Senator Bond has pointed out that she has put out three separate versions of the circumstances under which her husband was sent to Niger. According to *She told the CIA&#8217;s inspector general in 2003 or 2004 that she had suggested Wilson. *Plame told Senate Intelligence Committee staffers in 2004 that she couldn&#8217;t remember whether she had suggested Wilson. *She told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in March that an unidentified person in Vice President Cheney&#8217;s office asked a CIA colleague about the African uranium report in February 2002. A third officer, overhearing Plame and the colleague discussing this, suggested, &#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t we send Joe?&#8221; Plame told the committee. Which of these is the real story? Is Plame telling three versions of the truth, or is she a lying liar, orÂ even worse, a perjuring perjurer? Bond would like to find out. But the Intelligence Committee is now under the control of the Democrats who have no interest in calling attention to the antics of the Plame-Wilson provocateurs. Stay tuned, in other words, for the cover-up of the cover-up.Â Â  &laquo; back to contentions Email (required, but will not be published) You can use these tags: Dictatorships &#38; Double Standards Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream Why the New Right Lost The War Against World War IV How to Win World War IV Dictatorships and Double Standards My Negro ProblemâAnd Ours Goodbye, Columbus, by Philip Roth reviewed by Saul Bellow The Imagination of Disaster Getting Serious About Iran: A Military Option How Divided Are We?

Mr. Bush says a primary goal is to bring millions of illegal aliens "out of the shadows" and provide a path to legal residency and eventual U.S. citizenship. But while the president champions such reform, the United States is set to implement the largest-ever boost in fees charged to those applying for residency and citizenship. VOA's Michael Bowman reports from Washington that advocates for immigrant say the administration is sending mixed messages to an often fearful and vulnerable community. For newcomers, both legal and undocumented, the cost of pursuing the American dream is about to go up. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service is doubling, and in some cases tripling, its fees. Beginning July 30, the charge for adults seeking residency will exceed $1,000; the fee for citizenship will be nearly $600. Some say the higher fees undermine President Bush's stated goals on immigration. Crystal Williams is a deputy director at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. She says, "To come up with a thousand dollars per family member to obtain permanent residence -- it is going to keep a lot of people in the shadows for a very long time." Williams says the new fees constitute an enormous financial hurdle that will force countless poorer immigrants to delay applications -- and may lead some to give up entirely. But officials at the Citizenship and Immigration Service point out that their agency receives no federal funds to process applications. Costs are covered entirely by fees charged. They say, unless those fees reflect actual costs, services would have to be cut back and waiting times for applicants would increase. USCIS spokesman Chris Bentley explained. "We realize that anytime we increase the fees that there is a burden there. There is pain that is caused along the way. However, to be able to remain a world class service provider, to be able to get the services and benefits in a timely manner to the people who deserve them, we simply need the resources to be able to make that happen." Bentley adds that refugees and asylum-seekers will remain exempt from charge, and some fees can be reduced for residency and citizenship applicants facing dire economic hardship. But if USCIS is constrained by being entirely dependent on fees for operating costs, then it is time to change the system, according to Donald Kerwin of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network. "Citizenship is a national good. It is important for our country,â says Kerwin. âAnd so we think that to fix the system, to reduce backlogs and improve technology, there needs to be appropriated monies for this. It needs to go beyond the fee-based system." Some in Congress counter that it would be wrong to shift the financial burden to U.S. taxpayers. Republican Congressman Steve King of Iowa says the new fees are still far lower than what illegal immigrants typically pay smugglers to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. "We are seeing coyote [smuggler] fees go up to $1500 to $2500 per person,â said Mr. King. âI do not see any fees levied by USCIS that were that high. So if it is cheaper to have access to becoming a citizen than it is to be transported [illegally] to the United States, then, no, I do not think those fees are too high by comparison." Immigration officials also defend the fee system, saying it provides spending flexibility, since revenues go up in proportion to any rise in applications. They say that previous fee hikes have not resulted in drastic reductions in applications for residency or citizenship. Immigrant advocates counter that the current fee hike is far greater than any previous increases. They also note studies showing the percentage of eligible immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship dropping in recent decades. Opinions vary as to the cause, but immigrant advocates say making it more expensive for immigrants to pursue legal status or citizenship can only serve as a further deterrent.

George Bush's new selection to head the World Bank, Robert Zoellick has that over his predecessor, Paul Wolfowitz. But can't the world demand a slightly higher standard? The selection process for chief of the World Bank, which claims to be the world's preeminent anti-poverty institution, is preposterous. By tradition, the post goes to a U.S. citizen, to be selected by the U.S. President. There is no pretense of democracy at this international institution. Nor is there any pretense of demanding relevant development experience. None of the past presidents of the Bank, including Wolfowitz and Zoellick, has had any meaningful experience in development policy. There have been longstanding calls by people who actually care about development, and do have relevant expertise, to reform the Bank's archaic government structure. But more important than the Bank's governing process are its policies. The World Bank's great failings over the last decades are rooted in its commitment to the market fundamentalism known as "the Washington consensus." This is a set of maniacal market-oriented policies including: deregulation of the economy, opening countries up to capital inflows and outflows, removing all trade barriers and orienting economies to support exports, massive privatization (including even of such traditional government functions as customs collection), eliminating subsidies for basic necessities, rolling back legally guaranteed labor rights, cutting back on government services and restricting government spending. The Bank has also maintained a penchant for environmentally and socially destructive mega-development projects: big dams, oil and gas projects, road-building. The result has been a literal human disaster: the developing countries that have most closely hued to policies imposed by the World Bank (and its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund) have found themselves much poorer, less healthy and less educated than countries that have resisted Bank recommendations. In one notable example, the Bank's historic support for user fees for education and healthcare has denied millions of children the right to schooling, and deprived millions of people access to healthcare. The Wolfowitz controversy obscured the bigger issues at the Bank, and the questions now facing Zoellick: Will Zoellick oppose user fees for healthcare Will he support robust public health systems that rely on public providers -- not wishful thinking about HMO-style schemes delivering health care in developing countries? Will he abandon support for water privatization, which delivers profits to multinationals but raises costs to consumers and decreases quality of service? Will he end the Bank's heinous opposition to labor rights in its influential Doing Business report? Will he insist that countries be able to expand healthcare and education budgets, despite pressure from the International Monetary Fund? Will he support the recommendations of Bank-supported expert investigations, and end support for mega-development projects? As the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick pushed market extremist policies akin to those of the Bank, in World Trade Organization negotiations, and especially in bilateral and regional trade agreement negotiations. His very aggressive agenda as USTR increased monopoly rights for drug companies eliminating precautionary health measures removing protections for small farmers eliminating protective industrial tariffs in developing countries (a key element of the misnamed "Doha Development Round" of World Trade Organization talks that Zoellick helped kick off). To be fair to Zoellick, every recent person in his post, Republican or Democrat, has pushed the same Big Business agenda that he did. And on pharmaceutical and patent issues -- some of the key considerations at USTR -- he did not do everything Big Pharma wanted, and sometimes really pushed against the industry's interests (until overridden by the White House.) On the other hand, the fact that other former U.S. Trade Representatives pushed a broad Big Business agenda is hardly an argument for why Zoellick should be rewarded with the World Bank post. It is a better argument for why no former USTRs should be given the job. And even though Zoellick had major conflicts with Big Pharma, he did at the end of the day deliver on almost everything the companies wanted. As my colleague Asia Russell of the AIDS activist organization Health GAP says, "It's very difficult to imagine the same Bob Zoellick who carried water for Big Pharma being the kind of advocate ministers of health need in order to expand their investments in salaries for doctors and nurses to address 6,000 preventable AIDS deaths each day in Africa alone." The same point could be echoed about the rest of Zoellick's performance as USTR. Unless Zoellick makes a break from market fundamentalism, expect the World Bank to continue to generate rather than reduce poverty. And yes, the world should demand better. For the immediate term, Zoellick should be pressed to make specific commitments to abandon key components of the Bank's failed preferred policy set. The longer term agenda must involve achieving not just better governance at the Bank, but a completely refashioned orientation. * Zoellick does not seem to have been an active part of the Cheney-Rumsfeld cabal that concocted the case for the Iraq war and then carried it out, but he was (along with Paul Wolfowitz and others) a signer of the 1998 letter from the Project for a New American Century to Bill Clinton , urging Clinton "to turn your Administration's attention to implementing a strategy for removing Saddam's regime from power. This will require a full complement of diplomatic, political and military efforts."

The Senate adjourned in the early evening, and the House went until the midnight deadline with a last-ditch round of tense debate over water, border security and electric deregulation. The embattled Craddick finished the 140-day session as the man in charge of the House. He cocked his head back and laughed as he chatted with some Republican supporters in the House chamber toward the end of the day. Democrats and Republicans alike complain that Craddick has ruled with an iron fist. They say his win-at-all-cost style often forces them to vote against the interests of their own districts. Opponents tried all weekend to oust him from power, with no success. Craddick refused to allow the opposition bring up a motion for a vote to ``vacate the chair.'' Craddick is currently the longest-serving House member and the first Republican speaker since Reconstruction, having taken over in 2003 after the GOP won a majority of House seats. Frustrated by their failed attempts to overthrow Craddick, dozens of angry House members stormed out of the chamber in protest in the early morning hours Monday. ``This man is sitting here violating every rule of the House, every rule of parliamentary procedure to keep himself in office, and it's wrong,'' said Rep. Pat Haggerty, a Republican. A prepared statement from Craddick's office chided those it said were trying to divert the House from important matters and trying to drag lawmakers into a speaker's race. Despite some 11th-hour fights and threats in the Senate to filibuster the budget bill, the House and Senate signed off late Sunday night and early Monday on a compromise $153 billion two-year spending plan, the state's largest ever.

Murder Cold Case Under Way Wednesday May 30, 2007 5:31 PM AP Photo JX105, JX102 By EMILY WAGSTER PETTUS JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - The cold case trial got under way Wednesday in the deaths of two black teenagers who were beaten and dumped still alive into the Mississippi River during the state's dark days of racial brutality. Ku Klux Klansman James Ford Seale faces federal kidnapping and conspiracy charges - along with potentially damaging testimony from a man also charged back in 1964. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate began questioning prospective jurors Wednesday. ``We're at the doorstep of justice,'' said Thomas Moore, the brother of one of the victims, Charles Eddie Moore. For decades, books and news accounts treated the killings of Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee as footnotes in Mississippi's troubled history. They were 19-year-old friends who were hitchhiking on May 2, 1964, near Meadville when carloads of Ku Klux Klansmen were chasing rumors of a possible armed insurrection by black people in the area. Recent court records said the two were driven to the Homochitto National Forest and beaten, then stuffed into a trunk and driven more than 70 miles to the Mississippi River near Vicksburg. They were weighted down with engine parts and dumped, still breathing, into the Mississippi. Their bodies were found about two months later, when authorities were conducting a massive search for slain civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, who disappeared from central Mississippi's Neshoba County on June 21, 1964. Seale and reputed Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards were arrested in 1964 in the deaths of Dee and Moore. But the FBI was consumed by the ``Mississippi Burning'' investigation of the three civil rights workers and the Dee-Moore case was turned over to local authorities, who threw out all charges against Seale and Edwards. The Justice Department in 2000 reopened an investigation. Edwards has been granted immunity and is expected to testify for the prosecution. Thomas Moore and two of Dee's sisters - Thelma Collins, 70, of Springfield, La.; and Mary Nell Byrd, 61, of Natchez, Miss. - spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday in Jackson during an interview arranged by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. documentary maker David Ridgen. Since 2005, Ridgen and Thomas Moore have pushed federal officials to reopen the case. Ridgen's film, ``Mississippi Cold Case,'' is set to air Saturday night on MSNBC. ``I try not to think about it so much because, you know, it's done now,'' Collins said of her brother's death. ``But every time I think about it, I shed a tear.'' Dee and Charles Moore were not troublemakers, their families say. ``My thing is, Charles Moore and Henry Dee wasn't bothering anybody,'' Thomas Moore said Tuesday. ``And for them to be butchered, tormented, hassled and drowned in the river - it was pretty bad.'' Collins and Moore said they're prepared for any outcome in the Seale trial. ``I just have it in my heart that they're going to do the right thing,'' Collins said. Moore has already planned what he'll do after the trial, regardless of the outcome. ``The last thing that I'm going to do when I leave Mississippi, I'm going to go to that cemetery, that Mount Olive Cemetery. I'm going to tell Charles Moore, 'I told you that I (would) see it to the end.''' Join our dating site today Guardian Unlimited &copy; Guardian News and Media Limited 2007

But pundits on the right continue to defend Novak and I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, who was convicted of perjury in the leak investigation, dismissing Plame's covert status and rehashing allegations that she improperly suggested husband Ambassador Joe Wilson's trip to Niger that undercut the Bush administration's pre-war assertions about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. "Like the shape-shifting T-1000 cyborg in Terminator 2, Patrick Fitzgerald's claim that Valerie Plame was a covert agent, and that therefore Scooter Libby deserves a harsh sentence for supposedly outing her, not only won't die a proper death due to lack of proof, it keeps mutating into new forms," Al Johnson on conservative blog the American Thinker. Salon blogger Glen Greenwald more than a dozen instances of Republican pundits insisting prior to Friday's court filing that Plame was not a covert agent. Even White House spokesman Tony Snow told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly in February, "She wasn't a covert agent." Meanwhile, a Republican senator inserted into a last week on pre-war intelligence allegations that Plame lied in her testimony before congressional committees regarding Wilson's trip to Niger. According to Fitzgerald's filing, Plame traveled "sometimes in true name and sometimes in alias -- but always using cover -- whether official or non-official (NOC) -- with no ostensible relationship to the CIA." Blog headingright.com responded to the revelation that Plame traveled overseas "always using cover" in the years prior to her outing with a, la-la-la-I-can't-hear-you. "What you see her (sic) is a complete broadside fabrication from the rogues and nothing more," a poster The main point of contention seems to be that Plame sometimes traveled using her own name and identified herself as a government official if not a CIA agent, although conservative pundits seem to ignore that she also used "non-official cover" during some of her travels, during which she would be seen to have no ostensible relationship with the CIA. "Either way you look at it she was not a covert agent covered by the Intelligence identities Protection Act of 1982," read a post on conservative blog Flopping Aces . "This is why ole Fitz' never brought any charges against the leaker of her name." Plame's name was revealed in a July 14, 2003 column by Novak, which occurred after her husband published an op-ed in the New York Times that called President Bush's assertion in his State of the Union address that year that Saddam Hussein was seeking uranium from Africa untrue. on his blog Captain's Quarters, used the new revelation to criticize George Tenet's tenure at the CIA. "So now we have confirmation that Plame did get her cover blown. I suppose the only reason that Fitzgerald didn't bother to indict Richard Armitage for the crime was that it would have meant explaining how the CIA tried to hide its NOC asset in plain sight," Morrissey wrote, referring to the former deputy Secretrary of State who was eventually revealed to be Novak's original source. Conservatives have tried to undercut that assertion by insisting that Plame simply sent her husband on a "junket" to Africa, despite the contacts he built as an ambassador on the continent. Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., attached to a Senate intelligence report released last week a memo he said proved Plame recommended her husband for the trip, undercutting her assertion she had nothing to do with arranging the trip. the memo "doesn't square" with her testimony that an unnamed CIA colleague raised her husband's name. The memo from Plame reads, in part, "As you may recall [redacted] of CP/[office2] recently [2001] approached my husband to possibly use his contacts in Niger to investigate [a separate Niger matter] ... My husband is willing to help if it makes sense, but no problem if not, end of story." Plame's attorney told USA Today that Plame was not responsible for Wilson's trip. Bond's report, the attorney said, is an attempt to draw attention from the "real wrong here -- a White House that outed a covert operative and undermined national security."

That's the assessment of state Rep. Chuck Hopson (DJacksonville), who said the Legislature took a $15 billion surplus at the start of the session and "gave a little money to a lot of programs." In the final hours of the session, the Legislature provided a funding package of approximately $12 million to transfer the Texas State Railroad from the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department and privatize the excursion train with a private operator. "I have unbelievable, mixed emotions on the train," said Rep. Hopson. "I'm unhappy that it is not in the parks department. However, I feel real good that we're going to keep it rolling." Austin political watchers feared that funding for the rail authority was going to become mired in politics last week because of an attempted coup in the House of Representatives to unseat Speaker Tom Craddick. State Rep. Byron Cook, who authored the House bill to privatize the train, made a personal privilege speech on the floor and called for Mr. Craddick to step aside as speaker. Supporters of the move to privatize the train feared that Speaker Craddick might retaliate against Rep. Cook and de-rail efforts to fund the privatization. The omnibus appropriations bill, which is the funding mechanism for all state agencies, hung in the balance as Republican factions dueled on the House floor and maneuvered around rules and points of order to attempt to unseat Speaker Craddick throughout the weekend. On Saturday, members of the Legislature faced a possibility of not passing an appropriations bill and having to return during the summer for a special session to pass a budget bill. Tempers subsided briefly with the passage of HB 1. Shortly after the House signed off on the bill Saturday night, state Rep. Pat Haggerty (R-El Paso) tried one last time to unseat the speaker by taking a roll call vote. When that effort failed, he called on members to stage a walk-out at 1:30 a.m. Approximately 56 state representatives, both Democrat and Republican, walked off the floor in protest of Speaker Craddick's interpretations of house rules. "I stayed on the House floor and did not participate in the walk-out," said Rep. Hopson. "I thought we still had business to conduct." More than 30 bills required House action, including the controversial water bill, which designates 19 unique reservoir sites, and a funding bill for the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department. The House adjourned after the walk-out early Monday morning, but resumed session at 2 p.m. The proposed Lake Fastrill, located on the Neches River between Rusk and Palestine, had been removed from the House version of the bill. However, the Senate succeeded in getting Lake Fastrill added to the water bill. New language in the bill requires a commitment of funding by 2015 in order to retain the "unique reservoir" designation at each of the proposed, 19 locations. Stand-out legislation that Rep. Hopson said he is happy to see passed includes: + The Castle doctrine, which provides for a homeowner's right to defend his property against an intruder + Jessica's Law (HB 8), which provides tougher penalties against sex offenders, including capital punishment for some offenses + a law which prohibits law enforcement officers from confiscating firearms during a disaster such as a hurricane + expansion of the CHIPs program. "We added a whole bunch of kids to CHIPs and that's good for East Texas," said Rep. Hopson. "There are a lot of employers who provide insurance for mom and dad, but not for kids." Rep. Hopson said he is also pleased with reforms outlined for the Texas Youth Commission, and he said he is optimistic that the new executive commissioner will bring stability to the troubled agency. He said he hoped to see enough money funneled into the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department to allow state parks to be brought up to standards. "A lot of good things happened this time," said Rep. Hopson, citing property tax cuts which will be phased in. Even though the 180-day session adjourned at midnight Monday, Legislators are already looking ahead to the 81st session which will meet in January 2009. At least five Republicans have announced their intentions to run for House Speaker. System and Method for Display Ads have a Patent Pending. Click Here for More Information

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Bush Delivers Remarks on Immigration Reform Tuesday, May 29, 2007; 2:29 PM PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Thank you all very much. Please be seated, unless, of course, you don't have a chair. Bush Promotes New Immigration Plan GLYNCO, Ga., May 29 -- President Bush took to the road today to promote a bipartisan plan to overhaul immigration laws, assailing conservative critics he said were trying to scare the American public and accusing them of not reading the bill. Save & Share Article Thanks for having me. I'm honored to be here at the headquarters of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. I don't know whether you realize this or not, but the government originally planned to open this center inside the Capital Beltway. No one looks very sad that we didn't open it in front of the Capital Beltway. It's a spectacular place to have this center. It is a glorious place to live. I'm honored to be in your presence. Thanks for letting me come by and share some thoughts with you. I want to thank Director Patrick for her strong leadership and her kind introduction. I appreciate very much the tour I have just taken. A lot of our fellow citizens probably don't know what goes on here, but this is a center full of smart, capable instructors who are helping to train men and women who've volunteered to serve our country on the front lines of protecting the homeland. I am grateful to be in your midsts. I thank those of you who work here. I thank those of you who are being trained here. And I thank your families as well. We have a mission, a vital mission. And that's to protect our country. And you all are on the front lines of that protection. And it gives me great confidence when I meet you to tell the American people there's a lot of decent souls doing everything they can to provide security for the American people. So thanks. I appreciate the folks at FLETC that I met that are working the border and helping train people to secure this border of ours. And I've come today not only to thank you, but to talk about immigration. BUSH: Immigration is a vital issue facing this country. And the fundamental question is, will elected officials have the courage necessary to put a comprehensive immigration plan in place that makes it more likely we can enforce our border and at the same times uphold the great traditions -- immigrant traditions of the United States of America. That's what I want to discuss with you. Before I do that, I do want to introduce some people. I want to introduce Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez. I appreciate you coming, Mr. Secretary. Carlos wasn't born here. He was born in another country, Cuba. And now he sits in the Cabinet of the president of the United States. There's something great about a country that welcomes people, people who uphold our laws and realize the great blessings of America. With us as well is Senator Mel Martinez. He wasn't born in America. He's a senator from Florida. He was born in Cuba. I don't know if you know his story, but his mother and father put him on an airplane to come to the United States of America to be raised by total strangers because they didn't want their son to grow up under a tyrant named Fidel Castro. He used to sit in the Cabinet of the president of the United States. Now he sits in the United States Senate. What a wonderful country it is, where people can come to live in a country based upon liberty and realize the great blessings of our country. And I want to mention those two men because to me they represent what the immigration debate is all about: Will we be a welcoming place, a place of law that renews our spirit by giving people a chance to succeed? So, Senator, thank you for coming as well. I saved the other two traveling with me because they were born here. Starting with the United States senator from Georgia, a South Georgian named Saxby Chambliss; one of the finest senators in the United States Senate. BUSH: Finally, I asked Secretary Mike Chertoff to leave the bench to become the director of the Department of Homeland Security. It's a big job. It's a job that requires organizing various agencies under one task, and that's to provide protection to the American people. And Secretary Chertoff's doing a fine job. I'm glad he's joined us today. Thanks for coming, Mr. Secretary. I thank all the state and local officials who are here who have joined us. Appreciate you taking the time to come over and say hello. I thank the citizens from this part of the world who have joined us as well. Thanks for supporting this good institution. I know you know this, but FLETC provides an important role for this country of ours. And I thank you for supporting it. Before I talk about immigration, I do want to offer condolences for Agent Robert Smith. He died last week from injuries in a helicopter crash. He was a Customs and Border Protection agent. He reminds us on a regular basis that those who are on the front line of protecting the country take danger as a part of their job. And therefore we offer our deepest condolences for Robert Smith, his family and his friends, and we ask for God's blessings on them. Our nation depends on our federal agents to enforce our immigration laws at the border and across the country. You got a big job to do. We're counting on you to enforce those laws. And when you graduate from FLETC you're going to be an important part of that role. That's why you're here: It's to upgrade your skills so you have the capacity to do the job the country expects you to do. You're going to safeguard our ports of entry, you'll investigate workplace immigration violations, and you'll arrest those breaking the law. We're a nation of laws, and we expect people to keep the laws. And if they break the laws, there will be a consequence. This administration of mine is committed to ensuring that our federal agents have the resources you need to carry out your responsibilities. BUSH: And for some of the older hands here -- and I'm not going to pick you out of the crowd... ... I'm sure you will tell some of the younger folks that things have changed significantly over the past years. One way to measure how things have changed is look at the budget. We've doubled the funding for border security since I took office. We now spend $10 billion a year to protect this border. One commitment to the American people that we're serious about helping you do your job is to spend more money on the job. It's a way to measure whether or not we're meeting our words with commitment. And we are. We've used additional money -- people say, what are you spending it on? -- well, we're expanding the number of Border Patrol agents from about 9,000 to 13,000. And by the end of -- we have expanded it -- and by the end of 2008, we're going to have 18,000 agents. We will have more than doubled the Border Patrol in a relatively quick period of time. We believe the more manpower is on the border, the more likely it is we will be able to enforce the border, like the American people expect us to do. We're investing in new technology. We're strengthening infrastructure. In other words, we've taken our duty seriously, to protect the border of the United States of America. As a matter of fact, we take it so seriously that I asked the governors to -- you know, to put some National Guard troops down there until our Border Patrol agents got trained. And we're beginning to see some results. You know, in this immigration debate, oftentimes, people say, "Well, they're not doing anything to protect the border." Well, those folks just simply don't know what's going on. You do. The men and women who wear the uniform understand what's going on. There's a focused, concerted effort to enforce our border. As a matter of fact, you can tell when the border's better defended because the number of arrests go down. In other words, when people know there's a consequence to trying to sneak across, there's less likely to be people sneaking across. Arrests have gone down by 27 percent over the past year on the southern border. BUSH: That's a sign of progress. It should say to the American people that we're doing what the people expect us to do. The new infrastructure's making a difference. The Predators make a difference. The number of Border Patrol agents make a difference. I don't know if any of you spent time out in Artesia, New Mexico, if you're working for the Border Patrol. But I was impressed with boot camp. And they're training these Border Patrol agents to do the hard work that the American people expect them to do. You know, one of the problems we had prior to the administration addressing the problem was we had what was called -- what then was called catch-and-release. (inaudible) Border Patrol agent working hard, finding somebody trying to sneak into our country illegally. They'd catch them. And then they'd say, "Well, look, you need to come back for your hearing. We're going to let you out, but come back for your hearing." Well, the problem was that people didn't want to come back for their hearing. They generally wanted to go work. And so they would just disappear. And it discouraged our Border Patrol agents. I talked to too many agents and heard too many stories about people saying, "Wait a minute, I'm tired of doing my job on the front line of protecting the border only to have the people that I have stopped coming in meld into our society." And so we work with Congress and we've got a lot of detention facilities now along the border. See, we didn't have space before. Now we do have space. And as a result, catch-and-release has virtually been eliminated. It sends a strong -- getting rid of the catch-and-release program sends a strong signal to people: "If you come to the country, we will find you and we're going to send you home. So don't try to come in the first place." In other words, we're working hard to enforce the border. And we're stepping up enforcement inside the country. I see a lot of ICE hats. These are the folks that are charged with making sure that people who knowingly hire somebody who's here illegally pay a price. In other words, part of making sure our country has the rule of law, we've got to have people enforce the law. It's against the law to hire somebody who's here illegally. That's the law. And we're training people here to make sure that they know how to enforce that law. And the message to employers: "If you're hiring somebody here that you know is illegal, we're going to -- there's a consequence to be paid." That's what a nation that bases its system on rule of law does. That's what we'll continue to do. BUSH: And ICE is active. Your folks are working hard. ICE investigations have led to more than 3,000 arrests for immigration violations since the beginning of this fiscal year, nearly 600 arrests for criminal violations, including fraud and identity theft, and nearly $30 million in penalties against businesses that have violated the law. We're working hard to enforce the border. In the immigration debate you hear people say, "Well, they're not doing anything to enforce the border." They're wrong, and you know they're wrong. And I'm here to thank you for doing -- for working as hard as you can. And now we got to build on the progress. It's important for American citizens to understand that the immigration system is in desperate need for comprehensive reform. And Congress has a historic window to act. The system isn't working. Think about a system that encourages smugglers to stuff people in 18-wheelers, people that want to work, people want to provide for their families. Think about a system in which there's tremendous document forgery. You know, you got a person out here in South Georgia needs somebody to help them on their farm. Person shows up with documents. They don't know whether they're real or not. There's a lot of forgery going on. We got people -- in my judgment, this isn't what America should be about. And yet the system is broken to the point where people are being used as human cargo, being exploited, simply because most want to come and provide for their families. Most are willing to do jobs Americans aren't doing. The system needs to be fixed. I appreciate the Republicans and Democrats in the United States Senate, starting with Saxby Chambliss and Mel Martinez, who put politics aside and put courage first to work on a comprehensive bill. It takes a lot of courage in the face of some of the criticism in the political world to do what's right, not what's comfortable. BUSH: And what's right is to fix this system now before it's too late. And I thank you two for your courage. And Carlos and Mike Chertoff spent a lot of time sitting with the senators from both political parties. I don't know if you're tired of it, but a lot of Americans are simply tired of this endless political bickering, that we can't work together because it might make somebody else look good. I tried to change the system. It's not working. So I sat the two secretaries in there with the senators from both parties and said, "OK, why don't we sit down and see if we can't figure something -- something what's good for the country? Each side's going to have to give a little bit. Not everybody's going to get everything they want. But what matters more is fixing the problem now." And we're making some progress. Most Americans -- or many Americans say their primary concern is border security, and ensuring that those who violate our laws face consequences. That's what you're hearing out there when you're listening to the debate. Others say their chief concern is keeping this economy strong. There's -- a lot of employers need a legal way to fill jobs that Americans simply aren't doing. There's a lot of jobs here in Georgia that require people from -- that are willing to do the work that Americans aren't doing. It's just the way it is. You talk to your farmer friends or your nursery friends -- I remember the peach grower, Saxby, that you sent over to the White House. He's there saying to me, "You've got to understand something, Mr. President: My business won't go forward unless I have some of these good people that are willing to work long hours in my peach orchard helping me harvest the crop." So a lot of people in this debate are concerned about getting a bill in place that'll help keep the economy growing. Others say their main concern is to bring hard-working, decent people out of the shadows of our society. BUSH: All these concerns are part of the same issue. And it's important for American citizens to understand that the legislation now before Congress addresses them all as one. Our view is is that you can't solve the problem unless you address all aspects of the problem. We've tried to address immigration reform in the past by talking about only one aspect of immigration reform. To make it work, to address the concerns of the American people, there must be a comprehensive approach. A lot of Americans are skeptical about immigration reform, primarily because they don't think the government can fix the problems. And my answer to the skeptics is, give us a chance to fix the problems in a comprehensive way that enforces our border and treats people with decency and respect. Give us a chance to fix this problem. Don't try to kill this bill before it gets moving. Give us a chance to make it easier for the folks who wear the uniform along our borders to do our job. I believe the bill before Congress learns from the mistakes of the past. It is the best hope for lasting reform. If people are interested in fixing a system that's broken, this bill is the best hope to do so. It answers the longstanding concerns of the American people. It deserves widespread support. And I strongly back it. If you're serious about securing our borders, it makes sense to support legislation that makes enforcement our highest priority. And that's what this bill does. For decades, we have not been in complete control of the borders and many people have lost faith in our capacity to get control of the borders. I asked them to look at what's taken place over the past years -- recent years. I wish they could talk to some of your Border Patrol friends and talk about the advances that have been made and the good work they're doing down there. The first step to comprehensive reform must be to enforce immigration laws at the borders and at worksites across America. And this is what this bill does. But the skeptics who say that we're not concerned about border security or workplace enforcement, they need to read the bill. The bill prioritizes enforcing our laws at the border and saying to employers, "We'll hold you to account for employing somebody who's here illegally -- knowingly employing somebody who's here illegally." BUSH: This bill sets enforcement benchmarks that have got to be met before the other aspects of the comprehensive bill are triggered. In other words, there has to be certain accomplishments in place before other aspects of the bill come into being. And here are some of those markers: increasing the number of Border Patrol agents. In other words, we said we're going to double them. They've got to get doubled until other aspects of the bill come into being. We're going to build miles of state-of-the-art fencing. We're going to improve surveillance with advanced technologies. We will do a better job of holding employers accountable for the workers they hire. Most employers want to comply with the law. The peach grower wanted to comply with the law. Believe me, he's a law- abiding, decent man. His attitude is, "Why don't you help me verify the legal status of a potential employee, as opposed to holding me to account" -- which we will do, of course, if he knowingly hires somebody -- "give me a hand with a verification system." And that's why we're going to promote tamper-resistant identification cards. In other words if you're here working, you'll have a card that you can't tamper with, that some document-forger can't foist off as a document for somebody to come and pick peaches here in Georgia. In other words, we've got a serious attempt in this bill -- and a real attempt -- to do what a lot of Americans want us to do, and that's enforce the border. If you're serious about keeping our economy strong, it makes sense to support legislation that gives foreign workers a legal path to jobs in America. There are people doing jobs here Americans aren't doing. The peach man said to me, he said, "I can't find somebody from my hometown who wants to pick peaches. But I can find somebody who wants to put food on their table for a family from, you know, Mexico, for example." It seems to me it makes sense to give those people a chance to come and work here on a temporary basis. This bill says temporary means temporary. "You'll be here for a number of years, and you'll go back home." That's what a temporary- worker plan does. In the meantime, it helps meet the needs of our economy. This bill is going to -- this aspect of the bill will allow federal agents to focus on apprehending violent criminals and terrorists who are a threat to our country rather than people who want to work here. In other words, if you can come to our country on a temporary basis legally, you're not going to sneak across the border. Who wants to pay a coyote hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars when you can walk across and say, "I'm going to have a temporary-work job here in this country. And here's my tamper -- you know, my tamper- resistant card." If you're interested in securing the border, wouldn't you rather have Border Patrol agents chasing down terrorists and gun runners and dope runners as opposed to people who are coming to do jobs Americans aren't doing? A temporary-worker plan that is truly temporary is going to make it easier for us to enforce the border. Border enforcement and having a rational worker plan go hand in hand. And that's what the American people have got to understand. A temporary-worker program will not begin until our border security measures are in place, and until we have a reliable system for verifying employment eligibility. That's the way the bill works. I'm sure you've heard some of the talk out there about people defining the bill. It's clear they haven't read the bill. BUSH: They're speculating about what the bill says and they're trying to rile up people's emotions. This is a good piece of legislation. It addresses the border security needs and it addresses the employment needs of our country. If you're serious about bringing hardworking illegal immigrants out of the shadows of our society, it makes sense to support legislation that will resolve their status without animosity and without amnesty. Oh, there's -- I don't -- they estimate 11 million to 12 million people have been here -- some quite a while -- who are in an underground in America. It's not right, far as I'm concerned. That's not what this country stands for. I know there are some people out there hollering and saying, "Kick 'em out." That is simply unrealistic. It won't work. There are some people saying, "Giving them automatic citizenship." I oppose that. It won't work. I don't think it -- I don't think it makes any sense to do that. Amnesty is forgiveness for being here without any penalties. That's what amnesty is. I oppose it. The authors -- many of the authors of this bill oppose it. This bill is not an amnesty bill. If you want to scare the American people, what you say is, "The bill's an amnesty bill." It's not an amnesty bill. That's empty political rhetoric trying to frighten our fellow citizens. People in Congress need the courage to go back to their districts and explain exactly what this bill is all about in order to put comprehensive immigration reform in place. Let me explain how it works. Under the bill, those who want to stay in our country who have been here can apply for a Z visa. At some point in time, those who are coming to work will get temporary work visas. Those who have been here already can apply for a Z visa. To receive the visa, illegal workers must admit they violated the law and pay a meaningful penalty, pass a strict background check, hold a job, maintain a clean record, and eventually earn English -- learn English. BUSH: That's how it works. It says, "If you want to be here, here's what you have to do." There is a consequence for having broken the law. As a result of a recent Senate amendment, they have to pay back taxes if they hadn't paid taxes, too. You're working hard. You pay taxes. People who have been here in this country ought to pay taxes, that's what it says. The hurdles to citizenship are going to be even higher. In other words, if somebody says, "Fine, I'll take my Z visa, I'm out of the shadows now, I've got an opportunity to, you know, not hide in America, I'm going to continue doing the work I'm doing, I'm going to keep my record clean, I'll pay the penalties necessary so I can stay here." That's what it says. But if you want to be a citizen, there's more hurdles. It says the Z visa worker would first have to pay an additional fine. In other words, "You have broken the law and there's a consequence for breaking the law"; that's what the bill says. Secondly, you've got to return home to file an application for your green card. If you want to be a citizen, you pay a fine, you touch base home to apply for a green card, and then you take your place behind those who've played by the rules and have been waiting in line patiently to become a citizen. It's a good bill. It recognizes that we've got to treat people with respect, and it also recognizes we're a nation of laws. And as we go forward, the legislation creates a new system for admitting new immigrants to our country, people who want to come here legally. The system's going to reward applicants based upon skills and education, in addition to family ties, so we can ensure America continues to have the world's most talented workforce. This legislation is also going to help newcomers assimilate into our society. One of the great aspects of American society is people have been able to assimilate. You know, I was at the Coast Guard Academy the other day, and giving a speech there, and the president of the class, a Latino, talked with great pride in his voice about the fact that his grandfather was a migrant to the United States of America, and here he is addressing the Coast Guard Academy. BUSH: I think it speaks volumes about the great promise of America. One of the reasons why is because his family assimilated into our society and into our culture. They key to unlocking the full promise of America is the ability to speak English. That's the language of our country. If you can speak English in this country and work hard and have dreams, you can make it. That's the great story of America. I believe it's true today like it was true yesterday as well. We expect opportunities to help -- we will expand opportunities to help new immigrants learn the language, learn about the ideals that make us a wonderful country. If you're serious about reform, it makes sense to support comprehensive legislation that addresses all aspects of the problem. You cannot solve the problem unless we address all aspects of the problem at the same time. This reform's complex. There's a lot of emotions around this issue. Convictions run deep. Those determined to find fault with this bill will always be able to look at a narrow slice of it and find something they don't like. If you want to kill the bill, if you don't want to do what's right for America, you can pick one little aspect out of it. You can use it to frighten people. Or you can show leadership and solve this problem once and for all so the people who wear the uniform in this crowd can do the job we expect them to do. Now's the time for comprehensive immigration reform. Now's the time for members of both political parties to stand up and show courage and take a leadership role and do what's right for America. Thanks for letting me come by. And God bless.

The soldiers were killed in two separate attacks in the past week, the Department of Defense said in news releases Wednesday. Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif., and Cpl. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami, died Monday when an explosive detonated nearby during a dismounted patrol in Baghdad. Both were assigned to 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, one of two Fort Lewis Stryker brigades serving in Iraq. On Saturday, Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho, died in Baghdad when his vehicle was hit by a homemade bomb. Hester was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment with the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, Fort Lewis' other Stryker Brigade Combat Team that has been in Iraq since June. Hester had been in the Army three years, joining in May 2004. He arrived at Fort Lewis in September 2004, where he was assigned to the 3rd Brigade. McFall joined the Army in October 1994 and served a year in Korea beginning February 1997. He then reported to Fort Lewis to serve with the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment. In April 2001, McFall was stationed at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and deployed to Afghanistan with the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment from April 2004 through March 2005. He returned to Fort Lewis that September and had served since January with the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment. Sanchez joined the Army in November 2005 and reported to Fort Lewis last June for assignment to the 4th Brigade's 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry. The unit left for Iraq last month. He was posthumously promoted from the rank of private first class. The deaths came as Fort Lewis leaders said they would no longer be holding individual memorial services for soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, a move other military posts have already taken. "As much as we would like to think otherwise, I am afraid that with the number of soldiers we now have in harm's way, our losses will preclude us from continuing to do individual memorial ceremonies," Brig. Gen. William Troy, acting commanding general at Fort Lewis, wrote in a May 22 memo to commanders and staff. A copy of the memo was obtained by United for Peace Pierce County and posted on the group's Web site. Troy asked the post's senior chaplain, Col. Jack Van Dyken, to work out the details of the new policy set to begin next month. There are about 8,000 Fort Lewis-based soldiers in Iraq. "This is not an intent to streamline the process or in any way detract from honoring the soldiers," Van Dyken told The News Tribune on Tuesday. "It's just being cognizant of the fact that when you have this many, the time involved in doing each one individually is just prohibitive." "I see this as a way of sharing the heavy burdens our spouses and rear detachments bear, while giving our fallen warriors the respect they deserve," Troy wrote in his memo. "It will also give the families of the fallen the opportunity to bond with one another, as they see others who share their grief." A total of 127 Fort Lewis soldiers have died in all overseas deployments since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. This month alone, the post has held five memorials for troops killed in Iraq, including one for six soldiers killed in a single attack May 6 in Baqubah. The 4th Brigade is planning a June 5 memorial for four soldiers killed in its first month in Iraq: Staff Sgts. David Kuehl and Kristopher Higdon, Pfc. Robert Worthington and Spc. Mathew LaForest. Other Army posts already consolidating soldier memorials include Fort Carson, Colo., and Fort Hood in Texas.

An amendment to add Carson's name to an omnibus street-naming bill was defeated by a vote of 25 to 15, with seven abstentions and four members absent. As votes go in the usually lockstep Council, it was one of the narrowest in many years. And despite the Council's racial diversity, onlyone white Council member - Tony Avella (D-Queens) - voted with the losing pro-Carson side. Similarly, only one nonwhite Council member, Sara Gonzales (D-Brooklyn), sided with thewinning anti-Carson side, led bySpeaker Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan). The seven who abstained all belonged to the Council's 25-member Black, Latino and Asian Caucus. By abstaining, they strengthened Quinn's hand in the showdown vote. Quinn said she would fire any aide who pressured any member on their vote, and she made a no-retaliation vow against members who voted against her position. She argued that honorary street namings are a collective Council decision and should be reserved for individuals who brought the city together. She said Carson had "a record that is without apology a divisive record." She drew an unusual personal attack from Councilman Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn), the most vociferous supporter for naming a section of Gates Ave. in Bedford-Stuyvesant after Carson. Gesturing with his right index finger at Quinn, Barron said, "You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever divided any people anywhere."

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Texas House Speaker Beats Back Rebellion Tuesday, May 29, 2007; 2:57 AM AUSTIN, Texas -- After last-minute budget squabbles and an attempted rebellion against House Speaker Tom Craddick, the Legislature stumbled to the finish line early Tuesday without a change at the top. The Senate adjourned in the early evening, and the House went until the midnight deadline with a last-ditch round of tense debate over water, border security and electric deregulation. Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, R-Midland, sits near a portrait of Sam Houston and listens as speakers call for him to resign during the evening session in the Texas House of Representatives early Monday, May 28, 2007, in Austin, Texas. Opposition to House Speaker Tom Craddick exploded early Monday as dozens of Democrats and Republicans who want him to leave office walked out of the chamber in protest. (AP Photo/Harry Cabluck) (Harry Cabluck - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article The embattled Craddick finished the 140-day session as the man in charge of the House. He cocked his head back and laughed as he chatted with some Republican supporters in the House chamber toward the end of the day. Democrats and Republicans alike complain that Craddick has ruled with an iron fist. They say his win-at-all-cost style often forces them to vote against the interests of their own districts. Opponents tried all weekend to oust him from power, with no success. Craddick refused to allow the opposition bring up a motion for a vote to "vacate the chair." Craddick is currently the longest-serving House member and the first Republican speaker since Reconstruction, having taken over in 2003 after the GOP won a majority of House seats. Frustrated by their failed attempts to overthrow Craddick, dozens of angry House members stormed out of the chamber in protest in the early morning hours Monday. "This man is sitting here violating every rule of the House, every rule of parliamentary procedure to keep himself in office, and it's wrong," said Rep. Pat Haggerty, a Republican. A prepared statement from Craddick's office chided those it said were trying to divert the House from important matters and trying to drag lawmakers into a speaker's race. Despite some 11th-hour fights and threats in the Senate to filibuster the budget bill, the House and Senate signed off late Sunday night and early Monday on a compromise $153 billion two-year spending plan, the state's largest ever.

In a release updating lawmakers on its investigation, the department said it also was looking into hiring practices within its Civil Rights division. Lawmakers have questioned whether the division has hired prosecutors with strong political resumes but little civil rights experience. The Boston Globe, citing a letter the department's internal watchdogs sent yesterday to Congress, says the probes mark an expansion of the ongoing investigation into the removal of eight U.S. attorneys in December. "Among the issues that we intend to investigate are allegations regarding Monica Goodling's and others' actions in DOJ hiring and personnel decisions; allegations concerning hiring for the DOJ Honors Program and Summer Law Intern Program; and allegations concerning hiring practices in the DOJ Civil Rights Division," the letter says, according to the paper.

Antiwar icon pulls out of movement Sheehan voices frustration on new Congress Peace activist Cindy Sheehan, whose son, Casey, was killed in Iraq, led a group of protesters toward President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, on April 6. They were prevented by police from meeting with Bush to ask him to end the war. (Jason Reed/Reuters/file) By Susan Milligan, Globe Staff | WASHINGTON -- Cindy Sheehan, who became an icon of the antiwar movement after she set up a protest camp near President Bush's Texas home, said yesterday that she would resign as the "face" of the movement out of frustration with a Democratic-led Congress unable -- or unwilling -- to get the United States out of Iraq. In an online diary entry laden with sadness and bitterness, Sheehan said she could no longer sustain the full-time antiwar effort she mounted after her son, Casey, was killed in Iraq in 2004. "Casey died for a country which cares more about who will be the next American Idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while Democrats and Republicans play politics with human lives," Sheehan wrote on the Daily Kos, a liberal blog. "It is so painful to me to know that I bought into this system for so many years and Casey paid the price for that allegiance. I failed my boy and that hurts the most." Sheehan's decision reflects a growing frustration among antiwar activists, who hoped that the new, Democratic-run Congress would force the United States out of the war. But after a failed effort to impose a schedule for troop withdrawals, Congress voted last week to approve about $100 billion for the war effort. "There's anger out there," said Representative James McGovern , Democrat of Worcester and author of a measure to withdraw US troops within six months. "I think maybe there was an expectation that was not totally unreasonable, that somehow the Democrats would be able to end this [war] quickly once they won" control of Congress, he said. "I wish that was the case." Many Democrats -- including the entire Massachusetts congressional delegation and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Democrat of California -- opposed the war-funding measure, saying they could not vote to fund a war that they are determined to end. Democrats did not have enough votes to force Bush to accept a measure imposing a phased withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, a measure Bush vetoed May 1 and vowed to veto again and again if Congress kept sending it to his desk. But antiwar forces said they were disappointed with Democrats for not standing up to the president -- a complaint Sheehan expressed in her parting diary entry. "Blind party loyalty is dangerous whatever side it occurs on," Sheehan said, noting that she endured "slurs" from the left when she criticized Democrats as well as Republicans on the war. "If someone looks, dresses, acts, talks and votes like a Republican, then why do they deserve support just because he/she calls him/herself a Democrat?" Sheehan said. Antiwar activists initially focused their criticism on Bush and GOP backers of the war. But in the past months they have targeted Democrats as well, accusing them of lacking the political will to simply refuse to approve any money to pay for the war. "They're basically funding George Bush's work," said Tina Richards of Salem, Mo., who successfully fought to prevent her war-wounded son from being sent to Iraq a third time. Richards herself was in a verbal scuffle in March with Representative David Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, when she approached the lawmaker about cutting off funds for the war in Iraq. Representative Michael Capuano , Democrat of Somerville and a longtime foe of the war, said antiwar forces need to keep the pressure on GOP lawmakers to force a change in Iraq policy. "In some ways, she's an American hero," Capuano said of Sheehan. "I hope the message she is sending now is not, 'If I don't get my way in the time frame I want, I'll pick up my marbles and go home.' If that's going to be the case for the antiwar movement, we'll be in Iraq for generations," Capuano said. Sheehan camped out near Bush's Crawford, Texas, home for 26 days during the president's August 2005 vacation, demanding to talk to Bush about the death of her son in Iraq. Subsequently, Sheehan became a globe-trotting opponent of the war, drawing plaudits from antiwar activists and derision from critics who called her a pawn of the left and criticized her for meeting with leftist Venezuelan president Hugo Ch&#xE1;vez , a Bush nemesis. "In some ways, she's served her purpose. But because of the radical politics she adopted, she's marginalized herself with her former allies in the Democratic party," said Kristinn Taylor, a spokesman for , a conservative blog that has featured critical comments about Sheehan over the years. "The biggest concern a lot of us had -- outside her radical politics -- was that they were keeping her in a perpetual cycle of anger. They weren't letting her heal," Taylor said. Sheehan's compatriots wished her well and said they would continue the fight to stop the war. "The [congressional] leaders don't get it. They think they're going to be tarred with the 'weak on defense brush' " or be accused of not supporting the troops if they refuse to pay for the war, said Ellen Barfield , an Army veteran active in Veterans for Peace. "We just have to keep pushing them," she said. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company. All Globe stories since 2003 are now FREE E-mail to a friend The New York Times Company

East Bay Daily News Redwood City Daily News San Mateo Daily News Victor Maccharoli / Daily News file Burlingame residents crowded around the Broadway Grill on Wednesday afternoon to shake hands and talk to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Downtown campaign stop thrills supporters, detractors alike By Will Oremus / Daily News Staff Writer Dan and Laura Escobar and their 6-year-old daughter Ella got to the Broadway Grill in Burlingame at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday to get a good seat for a rare Peninsula public appearance by Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani. It was well after 11 a.m., the grill was teeming with media types and the Escobars were nursing their last sips of coffee when the popular New Yorker at last swept in with his entourage. With cameras whirring, the candidate briefly sat down with the Escobars, smiled and said he was glad to meet them -- and then he was off to the next table. He was gone too fast for Laura Escobar to snap a picture of the former mayor with Ella, but Escobar said the encounter was still a thrill. "We're definitely fans." Giuliani, who is polling as the leading Republican in the newly important California primary, talked to locals about border security and taxes in his whirlwind visit to Burlingame. But mostly the event was about face time with voters and the local press. Sitting down at a table next to Mike DeMaria and Nicholas Fleres, athletic coaches at Burlingame High School, Giuliani fielded an unscripted question about Barry Bonds' pursuit of Hank Aaron's baseball home run record. The candidate, a famous New York Yankees fan, declined to bash the slugger for his rumored steroid use, saying diplomatically, "Records are meant to be broken." Burlingame residents generally gave Giuliani a warm welcome, cheering his entrance and congregating outside the restaurant's windows and on the Broadway sidewalks to see him. Several identified themselves as die-hard supporters, including some who said they are New York transplants. Mike Murray, a Democrat who was eating at the grill Wednesday, said he doesn't much like Giuliani; he'd prefer Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn. But he was drawn to the novelty of having a big-time Republican candidate in liberal San Mateo County. As Giuliani worked the crowd on the right-hand side of the Broadway Grill, Murray heckled, "Hey Mr. Mayor, are you afraid to come over here to the left side of the room?" Burlingame Council Member Ann Keighran, also a registered Democrat, said a public stop from a figure like Giuliani is a good thing for the city regardless of politics: "It puts Broadway on the map." After making the rounds inside, Giuliani stepped onto the sidewalk for a brief press conference in which he struck at leading Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for advocating higher taxes. He said his own plan to get rid of the estate tax and cut capital gains taxes would stimulate the Silicon Valley economy. As he headed toward his limousine to scoot over to a private fundraiser at the Burlingame Hyatt, Giuliani stopped to greet a few final residents. The Escobars, now running hours late to take Ella to school, seized the moment and got the candidate to take the 6-year-old blonde into his arms for a photo. "Now at least it'll be easier to explain to the school why she wasn't there," Laura Escobar said. E-mail Will Oremus at woremus@dailynewsgroup.com.

House votes to legalize medical use of marijuana HARTFORD &#151; The House of Representatives, after six hours of debate that touched on many lawmakers' own experiences with debilitating illness, approved a bill Wednesday that would legalize the medical use of marijuana for certain patients. The bill passed on a 89-58 vote. It moves to the Senate, where a similar bill passed in 2005. That bill then failed in the House. Rep. Toni Boucher, R-Wilton, tried in vain to change the bill. She had filed about 50 amendments, but called only eight. They ranged from requiring the Department of Agriculture to set up a pilot program for medical marijuana patients to providing local police departments with the names of people using the drug for palliative purposes. "This should not be compared with other medications that doctors prescribe," said Boucher, who warned lawmakers they are embarking on "a dangerous direction." She voted against it. Connecticut lawmakers have grappled with the issue for the last five years. Supporters say it's needed to legally protect people who try to obtain the illegal drug to help stem the draining effects of diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. Tribune's deal to sell some papers to Gannett called off CHICAGO &#151; Tribune Co. disclosed Friday afternoon that its earlier agreement to sell two Connecticut newspapers to Gannett Co. for $73 million has been called off in the wake of an unfavorable arbitrator's ruling regarding Gannett's plan not to honor an existing union contract at one of the papers. Tribune announced in March that it had agreed to sell the Advocate in Stamford and the Greenwich Time to Gannett, which is based in McLean, Va. Nearly 40 of the editorial employees at the Advocate are represented by the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America union; when Gannett said it did not plan to honor the contract with the unionized reporters and photographers, the workers got a federal judge to temporarily block the sale of the operations, pending an arbitrator's ruling. Last month, the arbitrator ruled that Tribune couldn't sell the company unless the buyer agreed to assume the existing union contract as a condition of the sale. Gannett declined to do so, however, and on Friday the two companies announced the deal had been terminated. Tribune, which is in the process of going private through a heavily leveraged $8.2 billion transaction, said it will "immediately" begin soliciting new offers for the two newspapers. Tribune owns the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, WGN-Ch. 9 and other media properties. Norwich soldier dies in helicopter crash in Iraq NORWICH &#151; The month of May is ending as the deadliest month of the year for U.S. troops in Iraq. That grim reality hit home for a Norwich family, who learned their son was killed when his helicopter crashed on Memorial day. Army 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman, 24, was the 37th military member with Connecticut ties to die since the war began in 2002. Two Connecticut civilians have also been killed. "It's all a shock to us," said Chris Heidtman, the soldier's uncle. Heidtman was one of 10 U.S. soldiers who died in roadside bombings and the helicopter crash on Monday, the military reported. As of late Tuesday, there were at least 113 U.S. deaths in Iraq so far in May, with two days left in the month. Eight of the soldiers were from Task Force Lightning &#151; six killed when explosions hit near their vehicles and two in a helicopter crash. The military did not say if the helicopter was shot down or had mechanical problems. Heidtman was a 2001 graduate of Norwich Free Academy and a graduate of the University of Connecticut. His parents were notified Tuesday morning. He was the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux. His stepfather is Art Robidoux. "If you had to pick your son, this is who you would pick. He was handsome, he was bright," Chris Heidtman said. Heidtman arrived in Iraq in December and was scheduled to come home for leave in July. "We're sending our finest, and we're losing them," Chris Heidtman said. Gov. M. Jodi Rell ordered all state and U.S. flags lowered to half staff in Heidtman's honor. "Lt. Heidtman made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, and he did so to protect the freedom that we so often take for granted," Rell said in a statement. "To have given his life on Memorial Day is especially poignant." Funeral arrangements have not been announced. Mail to a friend

Lake Okeechobee hits record low fire in dry bed still burns (Last updated: 10:35 AM) MIAMI (AP) - Lake Okeechobee's water levels dropped to a record low today, the result of months of lower-than-normal rainfall levels that have afflicted the main backup water supply for 5 million South Florida residents. Plus a fire in a northwest dry riverbed is still burning. The incendiary fire started Monday in Buckhead Ridge in Glades County, but is not under control. It is sending smoke westward and has covered parts of Charlotte County. The South Florida Water Management District reported a record low of 8.94 feet, surpassing the mark of 8.97 feet set during a 2001 drought and tied Wednesday. The region's drought is leading water managers to assess how to best protect drinking water supplies, meet needs of the important agriculture industry and protect natural resources. The average water level should be around 13 feet this time of year in the second-largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. "There is no joy over this record-breaking event," said Carol Ann Wehle, the district's executive director. Record keeping on the lake's levels began in 1931. Lake Okeechobee is also the liquid heart of the Everglades. South Florida is largely dependent on the 730-square-mile lake during dry periods, when it can be used as a reservoir if water wells from underground aquifers get too low. Rainfall directly over the lake has been low enough to qualify this drought as a one-in-100-year event, the district said. Just 40 inches of rain have fallen on the region in the past 18 months, about half the average amount, water managers said. There is some possibility of rain this afternoon coming in from the Gulf of Mexico and chances of rain rise as the week goes on. The rain chance is 70 percent on Saturday, experts said. The area around the lake could get up to 1 1/2 inches of rain in the next two or three days, the National Weather Service in Miami said. The dry conditions have exposed vegetation that normally sits on the lake bottom. A 23-square-mile 15,000 acre fire started Monday in the dried-out vegetation in the lake's northwest rim. The fire was 75 percent contained today, and a voluntary evacuation for a mobile home park was called off. The fire in Babcock Ranch has broken 7,000 acres and is still 90 percent contained as it has been all week. That lightning fire is off State Road 31 behind Fire Station #9. There are no structures in danger, the Division of Forestry reported. The drought has forced stringent water restrictions on homes and businesses in 13 counties, and four coastal wells were closed to prevent saltwater contamination.

Heidtman had many opportunities. But it was a time of war, and he felt like he had to do his part, relatives said. So, like his grandparents in World War II, he joined the Army. On Monday, five months after deploying to a base in Tikrit, the 24-year-old first lieutenant from Norwich, Conn., died when the OH-58D Kiowa helicopter he was piloting came under heavy fire and crashed. One crewman also died in the crash, and six servicemen who attempted to rescue the crash victims were killed by enemy fire. As of May 30, 3,459 US servicemen have died in Iraq, according to the Pentagon. We were totally against him joining the military, but it was something he always wanted to do, and we supported him, said Arthur Robidoux, his stepfather. I think he had more maturity than I had, and Im twice his age. He was very mature, very goal oriented. He was well loved and well respected by a lot of people. Born and raised in Norwich, Heidtman graduated from the Norwich Free Academy, where he played first base on the baseball team and guard on the basketball team, in 2001, his parents said. He studied resource economics at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, they said. As a college junior in 2004, Heidtman enlisted in the campus ROTC program. When he graduated the following year, he went to boot camp and then the US Army Aviation Warfighting Center in Fort Rucker, Alabama, where he learned to be a helicopter pilot. Relatives said he was motivated to join the Army, in part, by the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. He wanted to serve his country and make a difference, said Jeffrey Cassis, his uncle. Im really proud of him, but its also quite a tragedy. He had a whole life ahead of him. I really miss him. Wanted to make a difference Posted by the Boston Globe City & Region Desk at E-mail to a friend More news updates from The Boston Globe The New York Times Company

Santa Fe / NM 'Bewusstseinslage' and more: National spelling bee begins Joseph Henares, 14, of Avon, Conn., reacts after spelling his word correctly in the preliminary round of the Scripps 2007 Spelling Bee in Washington, Wednesday, May 30, 2007. (AP Photo/Lawrence Jackson) By JOSEPH WHITE | Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) _ The start of the 80th Scripps National Spelling Bee on Wednesday resembled a classroom of students taking the SAT as 286 youngsters from the English-speaking world filled in ovals with their No. 2 pencils. Along with the 25-word, multiple-choice spelling test, they were also given their only guaranteed moment on the Grand Hyatt's ballroom stage: a chance to spell one word before an audience of parents, friends and judges. "Macaroni _ what does it mean?" asked 14-year-old Michael Yeh of Kokomo, Ind., exercising his right to ask for a definition before correctly spelling the popular kids' food often served with cheese. The multiple choice test (worth 25 points) and the preliminary oral round (worth three points) served to narrow the field to 90 or so spellers, who advanced to the quarterfinals Wednesday afternoon. The semifinals and finals take place Thursday, with the champion crowned in prime time on ABC for the second consecutive year. The winner receives $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. The oral round was hardly taxing for the top spellers. Tia Thomas, 12, of Coarsegold, Calif., back for her fourth national bee, correctly spelled "flagrant." The audience laughed when pronouncer Jacques Bailly defined "ninety" as "being one more than 89" for 13-year-old Mary Harrington of Vineyard Haven, Mass. Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kansas, made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever by correctly spelling "enumerated." Kate Weir, 13, of Christchurch, New Zealand, traveled far to participate, and she must have felt the wait was even longer when she was kept at the microphone while the judges conferred over her Kiwi-accented spelling of "eeriness." Her spelling was eventually replayed over the loudspeakers before it was declared correct. There were a few flubs, however. Ten-year-old Seher Sethi of Rhinebeck, N.Y., let out a sigh after misspelling "pallbearer." Christian Wilks, 10, of Freeport, Ill., tried to put an "a'' and an extra "l'' in "felony." During the breaks, the ballroom was vibrant with spellers who have become fast friends during their short time in Washington _ and some who have formed a camaraderie over the years. Matthew Evans, a 12-year-old from Albuquerque, N.M., who is also appearing for the fourth time, excitedly compared notes with Tia following the multiple choice test. Matthew said he got 24 correct. "My favorite word was actually word No. 25!" Matthew exclaimed. And what is that word? "Bewusstseinslage," he said, defining it as state of consciousness and pronounced bay-VOOHST-seins-lahg-eh. And why is it his favorite word? "Just because it's so weird sounding." Thirteen-year-old Samir Patel of Colleyville, Texas, was scheduled to take part in the morning's final oral round. Samir has finished third, 27th, second and 14th in his four national bees and is considered by many the favorite to win. "I feel I've been trying my hardest for the last few years and it hasn't worked out," Samir said. "But life is not completely about the spelling bee and I've learned to realize that. But I will be very disappointed if I don't win."

Skip to next paragraph Speaker Tom Craddick listened Tuesday below a portrait of Sam Houston as legislators urged him to quit. , added, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad the legislators are leaving town so that there is time for wounds to heal.&#8221; Despite the strife, lawmakers reached agreement on a number of issues, beyond passage of the two-year $153 billion budget. They mandated random steroid testing for high school athletes. They strengthened the right of Texans to carry handguns, without a license, in their vehicles. They gave a final failing grade to the little-loved statewide high school exams known as TAKS, phasing them out starting in 2011. They refused to tinker with the formula that guarantees college entry to the top 10 percent of each high school&#8217;s graduates, which began as an equal opportunity measure but is opposed by some educators as tying the hands of admissions officers. And they declared the blind salamander the official state amphibian. Ending their 140-day odd-year occupation of the capital, members of the State Senate and the House of Representatives, both controlled by Republicans, began streaming home with emotions raw from an unusual effort to unseat Speaker Tom Craddick, Republican of Midland, over complaints of autocratic abuses. Late Friday, lawmakers rushed the podium in an effort to force Mr. Craddick out of office. Representative Garnet F. Coleman, Democrat of Houston, said Monday that the events had historical implications. &#8220;It sends the message,&#8221; Mr. Coleman said, &#8220;that in a representative democracy, the people have a voice through their representatives, and no one individual has absolute power.&#8221; Mr. Craddick dismissed the uprising by dissidents in both parties as a coup attempt, and vowed to remain in office. He prevailed early Saturday after refusing to recognize members seeking a vote on his removal, prompting the House parliamentarian to quit. But members stormed out in protest again on Monday. Another fight erupted over efforts to require prospective voters to show a photo ID, which Republicans promoted as a way to curb election fraud, and Democrats resisted as a burden intended to suppress the Democratic vote. As the rancor grew, the office of Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican, released an open letter insulting the dean of the Senate, John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat (and a hunting buddy of Mr. Dewhurst.) Later, quipping that he feared going out with an armed foe, Mr. Dewhurst said his staff members had put out the letter in error. He reissued it minus the offending references. Soon after, the voter ID measure was blocked in the Senate when a Houston Democrat, Mario Gallegos Jr., recovering from a liver transplant, moved his hospital bed into a Senate antechamber to be on hand for crucial votes. Among the more noteworthy actions of the session was the overwhelming vote to thwart Mr. Perry&#8217;s executive order requiring vaccinations of sixth-grade girls against the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer. Although the order included an opt-out clause for parents, lawmakers condemned the governor&#8217;s action as an overstepping of executive authority. But lawmakers authorized a $3 billion bond measure, to be presented to voters in November, to finance grants of $300 million a year for 10 years to Texas institutions for cancer research. They also voted to restore coverage to 127,000 low-income children under the state health insurance program. The measure also eliminated a 90-day waiting period, allowed parents to register for a year at a time instead of six months and eased other restrictions. &#8220;This was a step in the right direction and a hard-fought victory for Texas children,&#8221; said Renee Wizig-Barrios, lead organizer in Houston for the Industrial Areas Foundation, a community organizing group. Reflecting growing unease over Mr. Perry&#8217;s proposed Trans-Texas Corridor, a vast toll road and rail link from Oklahoma to Mexico, legislators imposed a two-year moratorium on other toll-road contracts. The governor could veto some of the bills. In measures against crime, legislators added $200 million for more law enforcement officers and toughened the law against sexual predators of children, adding a death penalty for second offenders. Environmental groups praised the lawmakers&#8217; measures to encourage energy efficiency but denounced missed chances to control coal plant emissions. &#8220;While there was some progress on energy efficiency and renewable energy,&#8221; said Cyrus Reed, a lobbyist for the , &#8220;the Legislature left the plan in place for industry to increase tons of pollutants into the Texas air in coming years.&#8221; Some measures sailed through. A concurrent resolution of the House declared Athens, Tex., &#8220;the original home of one of the nation&#8217;s favorite foods, the hamburger.&#8221; (But don&#8217;t try putting that up for a vote in Louis&#8217; Lunch in New Haven, Conn., which makes the same claim.)

Reputed Klansman James Ford Seale is on trial in connection with the May 2, 1964, abduction and killings of Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore. The 71-year-old former cropduster has pleaded not guilty to federal kidnapping and conspiracy charges. The jury pool, which started at 76 Wednesday morning, was reduced to 55 by Wednesday afternoon, all 21 being excused for hardships or other reasons. This morning, the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers are quizzing potential jurors about publicity theyve witnessed. If more jurors are needed, Justice Department prosecutor Paige Fitzgerald said another panel will be called. Unlike in past trials, the potential jurors names are not being disclosed. The potential jurors were asked to make sure their names matched up with an assigned number. Fitzgerald sought the anonymous jury for the trial because she said Seale has participated in a group with the capacity to harm jurors. Seale has denied being affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan. The potential jurors were summoned from the 45 counties of the Southern District, which stretches from Holmes County in the north down to the Gulf Coast. Selection of a jury could take a week, a defense attorney said. Opening statements and testimony arent expected to begin until next week.

"Today" show co-host Matt Lauer and presidential hopeful Mitt Romney apologized yesterday for conducting an interview in a moving car without wearing their seat belts. "As we were driving in the car and talking, Governor Romney and I were not wearing our seat belts," Lauer said yesterday, immediately after the pretaped segment aired around 7:12 a.m. "As the guy who just interviewed Jon Corzine for that issue, I should have set a better example." Lauer noted that the interview took place in New Hampshire, where there is no seat-belt law - the pair were also sitting in the back seat, where adults in most states are exempt from the rule - but said that was no excuse. Romney also admitted he set a bad example, "and for that I apologize," he said in a statement. "Sometimes I forget to wear my seat belt. For my own safety, I need to keep reminding myself to buckle up," Romney said. After the apology, Lauer turned to Tim Russert, NBC&#39;s Washington bureau chief, to analyze the interview with the former Massachusetts governor. "Where do I send my dues to the dumb club?" Lauer joked. "Click it, Matt," Russert said. Lauer taped part of his "Today on the Trail" segment Tuesday as he and Romney drove between Alton and Laconia, N.H. At times, their caravan of cars reached 65 mph, according to reports. Lauer was the first major news personality to interview New Jersey Gov. Corzine earlier this month, following Corzine&#39;s near-death accident. Corzine was nearly killed April 12 after his speeding SUV crashed on the Garden State Parkway. The governor, who was unbelted at the time and sitting in the front seat, broke a leg, ribs and other bones.

Jury selection began yesterday in the trial of a former Klan member charged over the brutal 1960s murders of two young black civil rights activists in Mississippi. Former policeman James Seale, 71, has been charged with the May 1964 kidnapping of Henry Dee and Charles Moore, both 19. It's alleged Mr Seale and others beat the teens to make them confess to weapons smuggling, then lashed them to an engine and a piece of rail and threw them into the Mississippi. "While the Klan has lost much of its influence in recent years, it is still an active organisation, and it still strikes fear in the hearts of many citizens in Mississippi and elsewhere," prosecutor Paige Fitzgerald said in papers filed in court. One potential juror said one of her cousins was married to one of Mr Seale's cousins. "That makes me nervous, even though I don't know him personally," the woman said, nodding towards Mr Seale. Among 20 others dismissed from the initial jury pool of 76 was a young woman wearing a Confederate battle flag T-shirt. Mr Seale, who has denied Klan membership, faces up to life in jail if he is convicted. The case is the latest of more than a dozen civil rights-era cases prosecuted across the South since the early 1990s. Mr Seale and reputed fellow Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards were arrested in 1964 over the deaths, but the case was thrown out. The case was reopened in 2005 after years of lobbying by the brother of one of the victims. Mr Seale had been believed dead for years until Thomas Moore, 63, tracked him down in southern Mississippi while investigating the murders. Mr Edwards has been granted immunity and is expected to testify for the prosecution. Mr Seale's jail jumpsuit was topped by a bulletproof vest as he left the court.

Outside the headquarters hotel, members of the Simplified Spelling Society urged a complete rewrite of the English language, so that the "e" in the word "met" is also used in the words "said" "many" and "jeopardy." Inside, the adrenaline of 286 youngsters who range in age from 10 to 15 filled the hotel with exuberance. "I just want to be on TV," said Zina Ellis, of Moline, Ill. The 13-year-old's mother, Thea, confided that her daughter requested, if she were to win, $1,000 for shoes in different colors to go with every outfit. To get on television, contestants have to make it to the semifinals, which will be carried today on ESPN. To win, they'll have to get to the championship round, carried tonight by ABC. Alas, Ellis was eliminated in the fourth round, on the word "bracteolate" (she spelled it as "brachteolate"). Thanks to recent attention from Hollywood, interest in spelling and spelling bees has spiked, with this year's national contest attracting 10 million contestants. "Children want to be recognized," said Paige Kimball, the event's director and the 1981 champion. "All too often, children who prefer academics to athletics take a back seat." Sala Aouad, of Terre Haute, Ind., said her son Kennyi did not speak until he was 5. By then, he had been reading regularly, memorizing words. In the fourth grade, he entered a local spelling bee -- and lost. "Kennyi never likes to lose," she said. Now 11, he said he's excited at the chance to test himself against the best in the nation. "I like competition," Kennyi Aouad said. "It puts one's skills to the test." Aouad not only advanced to today's competition, but he brought down the house in the third round when confronted with the word "sardoodledom." His first reaction was to burst out laughing. The crowd in the 1,100-seat ballroom burst out laughing too. Every time the judge offered the word, the 11-year-old burst out laughing. With the clock running (contestants get two minutes and 30 seconds to spell the word from the time they hear it), he had to stop the giggles to spell the word. When he did so correctly, the crowd burst into applause. For much of its life, the Bee was a niche event. Then two things happened to change its complexion. In 1985, Balu Natarajan, a 13-year-old son of Indian-American parents, won by correctly spelling "milieu." He became an overnight sensation in his ethnic community, and many first-generation Americans came to see the contest as a passport to acceptance in U.S. culture, encouraging their kids to compete. Then, Hollywood discovered the contest. In 2002 the documentary "Spellbound" won an Oscar nomination, followed by a Broadway musical and last year's film "Akeelah and the Bee," which tracks a Los Angeles girl as she overcomes adversity to compete in the event. The contest also has attracted its share of writers. Myla Goldberg's 2000 novel "Bee Season" was made into a movie starring Richard Gere, and pop culture writer James Maguire wrote a book last year called "American Bee: The National Spelling Bee and the Culture of Word Nerds." But few in the lobby of the Grand Hyatt Hotel carried themselves like nerds. Clustered in groups, mostly with parents, sponsors of coaches, they checked their hair, worried about the competition and traded war stories about previous bees. Kunal Sah, of Green River, Utah, in his second National Spelling Bee, had a special mission. His parents, denied political asylum, have been deported to India while the 13-year-old lives with relatives in a motel and studies words. Hoping to win so he could spotlight his parents' plight, he said his goal was "to get to the top." The first-round written test has 25 questions, each worth one point, and the second-round oral words are worth three points each, for a total of 28 points. Contestants need 18 points to advance to the third round. Sah passed the verbal word -- "hurdle" -- with barely a hiccup. But he missed more than 10 questions on the written exam and will have to wait until next year. About the Real Cities Network About the McClatchy Company

A hurricane research team has renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season. REUTERS/Carlos Barria MIAMI (Reuters) - The Colorado State University hurricane research team renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season on Thursday and predicted 17 tropical storms, with nine growing to hurricane strength. Of those, five would grow into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher with winds over 110 mph (177 kph), the team founded by forecast pioneer William Gray said in its revised forecast. The updated forecast issued on Thursday was unchanged from the team's April 3 forecast for the six-month storm season that starts on Friday. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) The researchers said there was a 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane would hit the U.S. coastline in 2007, with a 50 percent chance that would happen on the U.S. Atlantic Coast and a 49 percent chance on the Gulf of Mexico coast. An average season brings 11 tropical storms, with six reaching hurricane wind speed of 74 mph (119 kph) and two growing into major hurricanes. Other private and government weather researchers have also predicted a more active season than average. But so far none have forecast anything like a repeat of record-breaking 2005, when 28 tropical storms spawned 15 hurricanes, including Katrina which flooded New Orleans and parts of the Gulf coast.

The average water level should be around 13 feet this time of year in the second-largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. The 12,000-acre fire started Monday in the vegetation left to dry in the sun as waters receded from the lake's northwest rim, said Melissa Yunas, a spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Forestry. "All the water is not there. Now it's just vegetation, all dried out, just sitting on the side of the lake," Yunas said. The cause of the fire was unknown. It was about 50 percent contained, Yunas said. Lake Okeechobee is a backup drinking water source for millions of people in South Florida and the lifeblood of the Everglades. The region is largely dependent on the lake during dry periods, when it can be used as a reservoir. "The Everglades are also in a drought. We've totally lost the backup for the water supply for the east coast" of Florida, said Carol Wehle, executive director of the water management district. An above-average rainy season is needed to replenish the lake and South Florida's groundwater system, officials said. Only about 7-8 inches of rain have fallen on the region in the past five months, about half of normal totals. No significant rainfall was expected over the lake or the Kissimmee River valley to its north before Thursday night, according to the National Weather Service. The drought has forced stringent water restrictions on homes and businesses in 13 counties, and four coastal wells were closed to prevent saltwater contamination. The drought has allowed officials to begin clearing 500,000 cubic yards of rotted plant life and sediment from the southwest portion of the 730-square-mile lake to return its bottom to a more sandy base, improve water quality and restore wildlife habitat. Deep cracks cover the bottom of what should be five-feet deep Lake Okeechobe near Okeechobee, Fla. in this May 1, 2007 file photo. State water and wildlife managers are taking advantage of unprecedented drought conditions by removing life-choking muck along Lake Okeechobee's shoreline. The 500,000 cubic yards of rotted, dead plant life and sediment will be trucked from the southwest portion of the lake starting Thursday, May 23, 2007, to pastures for disposal. Its removal over several months will return the lake's bottom along its shoreline in that area to a more natural sandy base and create clearer water and better habitat for plants and wildlife.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/0-6&fd=R&url=http://www.knoxnews.com/kns/politics/article/0,1406,KNS_356_5563105,00.html&cid=1116814215&ei=muxeRqKEDZGoqwPX6vjNDQ Thompson interest likely to become official Thompson expected to affirm run for president soon; others offer support By TOM HUMPHREY, tomhumphrey3@aol.com NASHVILLE - As Fred Thompson wades into presidential waters, operatives for prospective opponents are already researching his Tennessee background, fans are considering trips to the Iowa caucuses, and the state's Democratic governor is saying he should run. The actor and former U.S. senator has made it increasingly clear that he intends to run, basically saying so in an interview reported Wednesday after spreading word in national media that he will form a presidential committee by next week. He may follow up with an official announcement in Nashville around July 4. Also Wednesday, Thompson asked to be released from his role of playing a prosecutor on the TV series "Law & Order." The show's executive producer, Dick Wolf, said Thompson told him he "has not made a firm decision about his political future" but that he was concerned about "the creative and scheduling constraints of the upcoming season." Should Thompson, 64, choose Tennessee as an announcement site and decide to locate the "Friends of Fred Thompson" campaign headquarters here, as reported, the move would mark something of a homecoming for a politician gone but far from forgotten in his native state. There's been some quiet grumbling, however, that Thompson has occasionally seemed uninterested in Tennessee. As state Democratic Party chairman Gray Sasser is quick to point out, Thompson no longer lives in Tennessee and is registered to vote in Virginia. In fact, he will be speaking to Virginia Republicans on Saturday while former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney addresses the "Statesman's Dinner," the biggest event of the year for the Tennessee Republican Party. The Romney address was booked months ago, before Thompson took his unannounced-but-interested stance. That stance, Thompson told USA Today in an interview reported Wednesday on the newspaper's Web site, "has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime." "I can't remember exactly the point that I said, 'I'm going to run,' " Thompson said in the interview. "But when I did, the thing that occurred to me: 'I'm going to tell people that I am thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it.' " The Romney speech to Tennessee Republicans creates "a little bit of a ticklish situation," said Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, who is the official chairman of the Statesman's Dinner and, like virtually all state Republicans, an ardent Thompson supporter. "His career may have taken him out of the state, but his heart is still in Tennessee," said Ramsey of Thompson. "We all know that." Tennessee was considered an open state to Republican presidential candidates after former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist declared he would not seek the nomination. Other Republican candidates made forays into the state, though Romney had arguably made the earliest headway. If Thompson officially gets into the race, Republicans agreed Tennessee will almost certainly become solid Thompson turf. Tennessee's presidential primary is now scheduled for Feb. 5, a date when many other states also will be voting, including California and New York. Thompson's entry would likely cross Tennessee off the list of places to visit for all others in the race, several said. Two Tennessee GOP lawmakers, Reps. Marsha Blackburn of Brentwood and John J. Duncan Jr. of Knoxville, had announced earlier that they backed Romney for the party presidential nomination. They have switched allegiance to Thompson. One of the state's key GOP financial figures, businessman Ted Welch of Nashville, has so far stuck by his early commitment to Romney. But most Tennessee Republican notables strike stances similar to that of state House Republican Leader Jason Mumpower, who declared, "I will do anything under the sun to help Fred Thompson be the next president of the United States. "I'll go to New Hampshire, I'll go to Iowa, I'll go anywhere, and I'll foot my own bill," Mumpower said. The Iowa caucuses are Jan. 14, with the New Hampshire primary eight days later. Several prominent Tennessee Republicans, including former Sen. Howard Baker, Frist and Rep. Zach Wamp of Chattanooga, have played key roles in the "draft Thompson" effort. The former senator's eldest son, Fred D. "Tony" Thompson Jr., who works as a lobbyist at the state Legislature, said his father is "taking the next step in the natural progression of things" by "testing the waters" in moving to set up a committee allowing him to raise money for a campaign. The younger Thompson declined to confirm reports that his father would make a formal announcement July 4 in Nashville. Asked where he would be for that holiday, he said, "I plan to be with my family." Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, was asked about a prospective Thompson candidacy Wednesday. "I certainly think Fred Thompson is the kind of person who ought to be stepping forward and making himself available for this," said Bredesen, describing Thompson as "a fine, estimable man." "I am a Democrat, obviously, and barring some disaster in my party, I'll probably be supporting the Democratic nominee. But he's a fine fellow and would be a great addition to the field," Bredesen said. Tom Humphrey may be reached at 615-242-7782. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Boeing subsidiary accused of aiding CIA torture flights By Henry Weinstein, Los Angeles Times | LOS ANGELES -- The American Civil Liberties Union announced yesterday that it will sue a subsidiary, alleging that the company helped the Central Intelligence Agency with "the forced disappearance, torture, and inhumane treatment" of three men the government suspected of terrorist involvement. "This is the first time we are accusing a blue-chip American company of profiting from torture," said ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner, who spoke about the case, filed in federal court in San Jose, Calif., at a news conference in New York. Since at least 2001, Jeppesen Dataplan Inc., of San Jose, "has provided direct and substantial services to the United States for its so-called 'extraordinary rendition' program, enabling the clandestine and forcible transportation of suspects to secret overseas detention facilities where they are placed beyond the reach of the law and subjected to torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment," the suit alleges. A spokesman for Jeppesen said: "There isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for them." "Publicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standards," the suit states. Jeppesen provided flight and logistical support services to aircraft and crew used in the rendition program "to unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in Morocco, Egypt, and Afghanistan," adds the suit brought on behalf of three men. They are Binyam Mohammed, a British resident who was taken into custody in Pakistan and is being held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba; Abou Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and is being held in Morocco; and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian citizen, who while seeking asylum in Sweden was arrested by Swedish security police, handed over to CIA agents, shackled, drugged, and flown from Stockholm to Cairo, according to the suit. ACLU lawyers, including the organization's executive director, Anthony Romero, said they had obtained information about the rendition program from a variety of sources, including investigations in Spain and Sweden and media reports, in particular an article by Jane Mayer in The New Yorker on Oct. 30. Mayer wrote that a former Jeppesen employee told her that at a company board meeting a senior Jeppesen official stated: "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights -- you know, the torture flights." &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Washington, May 30, 2007 Immigration officials said on Tuesday they will proceed with plans to double the cost of applying to become a US citizen and triple the fee for seeking legal permanent residency. The fee increases will take effect July 30. Citizenship fees will rise from $330 (â¬244) to $595 (â¬440), plus $80 (â¬59) for required electronic fingerprints, an increase of $10 (â¬7.40). For legal permanent residency and fingerprints the cost will be $1,010 (â¬748) for those over 14. The cost now is $325 (â¬241). Officials with Citizenship and Immigration Services, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, said the increases are needed to improve service, hire 1,500 workers, improve offices, equipment and systems to process applications. "This agency is fee based, 99 per cent of our budget comes from user fees. We need to be the agency people expect us to be. We need to undertake reforms .... The only way to get from there to here is to have the financial resources to do that," CIS Director Emilio Gonzalez said Tuesday. Many immigration groups and some Democratic members of Congress have protested the fee increases, saying they will put citizenship and legal immigration out of reach of many immigrants. They also question whether better service will follow. The new fees were to be published this week in the Federal Register and also were posted on the CIS Web site.

Skip ads and navigation Last updated May 30, 2007 9:43 p.m. PT Presidential hopefuls campaign in Calif. Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, center, toast with a glass of orange juice with supporter Mike DeMaria, right, during a visit to Broadway Grill in Burlingame, Calif., Wednesday, May 30, 2007.(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) BURLINGAME, Calif. -- Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday declared that California's early primary has made the state more than a political ATM - just as he accepted a check from a supporter and then headed to two fundraisers. California's Feb. 5 presidential primary seemed to be having a modest effect, with several major candidates blending their fundraising chores with campaign stops to greet potential voters. Mostly, however, the focus was on fundraising. Democrats John Edwards and Hillary Rodham Clinton also trolled the nation's most delegate-rich state for cash and votes Wednesday. Between them, the three candidates held six California money events. Edwards, during an appearance between the four fundraisers he is holding over two days, decried the influence of money on politics and called for public financing of campaigns. "I'm not holier-than-thou about this. I've raised millions of dollars in 2004 and now to run for president," he added. "But that doesn't mean I think the system is good, because I don't." Giuliani stepped off a plane at San Francisco International Airport and promptly went to the Broadway Grill a few minutes away to chat with customers. His campaign ensured the lunchtime visit was stacked with supporters, sending out an e-mail Wednesday morning urging them to stop by the cafe en route to the fundraiser. Those crowded into the restaurant appeared to be a mix of regulars in T-shirts and committed supporters clad in suits and ties and bound for the fundraiser, which cost $250 and up. George Yerby handed the candidate a check for $200 on the spot. Giuliani hastily passed it to an aide. "He's going to be the next president," Yerby, 67, who lives in the wealthy Bay area enclave of Hillsborough, said afterward. "I hope." Giuliani closed his fundraisers here and in Beverly Hills to the public and news media. The restaurant stop, where he sipped orange juice and coffee, was open. He acknowledged to reporters outside the grill that raising money "has always been a big focus in California, like it was in New York." "One of the complaints that New Yorkers have had, and that Californians have had, is 'They come here, they take our money, but they don't campaign here.'," he said. "So now, they're going to get both - they're going to get us coming here and trying to get your money, but also coming here and campaigning." California is one of 15 states to move its primary to Feb. 5, and others are considering it. Its primary for state candidates will remain in June 2008. Giuliani promised to return regularly if he captures the GOP presidential nomination. "I think I'm the one Republican candidate who has a legitimate chance of winning California. That's based on the polls," he said. A Field Poll of California voters in March suggested otherwise. It showed GOP rival Sen. John McCain running stronger against Edwards and Clinton in hypothetical head-to-head matchups. McCain and Giuliani trailed Democratic candidate Barack Obama by identical margins, and also were behind Clinton and Edwards. Edwards headlined a fundraiser in San Francisco on Wednesday, headed to a second one Wednesday evening in the Bay area suburb of Atherton and planned two more Thursday. During an appearance at the headquarters of search-engine leader Google, Edwards said the current system of paying for campaigns is "dysfunctional." "The way we finance political campaigns in this country, it couldn't be more unhealthy," Edwards told about 1,000 Google employees. He called for taxpayer-financed campaigns - the only way, he said, to "literally pull the life out of these big groups - people that have a huge presence in Washington, lobbying groups." The former senator from North Carolina was the fourth presidential candidate to submit to questioning by executives and staffers of Google. Clinton, meanwhile, held two fundraisers in the Los Angeles area, one hosted by director Steven Spielberg.

In an energetic defence of the proposed law soon to be debated in the Senate, Bush rejected critics who are calling the legislation an amnesty for illegal immigrants, and said kicking them out of the country is "simply unrealistic." "If you want to scare the American people, what you say is, 'The bill's an amnesty bill.' "It's not an amnesty bill. That's empty political rhetoric trying to frighten our fellow citizens," Bush yesterday said in southern Georgia at a training centre for government security officials. "Amnesty is forgiveness for being here without any penalties," he said. "This bill is not an amnesty bill." "I'm deeply concerned about America losing its soul," Bush told the McClatchy newspaper chain in an interview. "Immigration has been the lifeblood of a lot of our country's history," Bush said. "I am worried that a backlash to newcomers would cause our country to lose its great capacity to assimilate newcomers," he told the news service. The bill, which was introduced in the Senate last week, could eventually allow most of the estimated 12 million undocumented workers in the United States to gain legal status, in the most sweeping immigration law reform in 21 years.

Zoellick, 53, will succeed Paul Wolfowitz who steps down by the end of next month, following a scandal in which he was found to have broken the rules in arranging a pay rise for his girl friend and bank employee, Shaha Riza. President Bush named Zoellick as World Bank President as indications emerged that the United States may be alarmed at the expanding military capability of the People&#39;s Republic of China and how it might be used, in a report released by the office of the Secretary of Defense. Although Bush announced his decision yesterday, Zoellick&#39;s selection must be approved by the Bank&#39;s 24-member board. Reports say the administration hopes the new nominee will receive acceptance from the board and other countries as well. In a statement, the White House extolled the qualities of its new nominee thus: "Bob Zoellick has had a long and distinguished career in diplomacy and development economics. "It has prepared him well for this new assignment. He is a committed internationalist. He has earned the trust and support of leaders from every region of the world." The statement further said Zoellick "is deeply devoted to the mission of the World Bank. He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty, to grow their economies, and offer their people the hope of a better life. Bob Zoellick is deeply committed to this cause." In response, Zoellick said that it would "be an honor to help lead this key institution and to work with the many fine professionals from all over the world who are dedicated to overcoming poverty and creating opportunity." He thanked the President for the confidence placed in him. His words: "Thank you, Mr. President for the confidence you&#39;ve always placed in me, and for the strong support you&#39;ve continually offered. Your vision of public service is to strive for great goals, and with your help, I&#39;ll do my best." The executive directors of the poverty fighting institution had Tuesday outlined key qualities that are required of the next president to include a "track record of leadership, experience managing large, international organizations, a familiarity with the public sector and a willingness to tackle governance reform, a firm commitment to development, a commitment to and appreciation for multilateral cooperation and political objectivity and independence. While Zoellick&#39;s name was not mentioned by the Board, the statement however noted that "as the selection process gets underway, the Board expects an intensive process of formal and informal consultation with the Executive Directors on potential nominees, adding that "the Executive Director for the United States has informed them that the United States will be nominating a candidate." If he is approved, Zoellick will be faced with the daunting challenge of rebuilding trust and confidence in the World Bank, which had been eroded during the Wolfowitz saga. Worried by the reaction of stakeholders and international donors, the special panel that investigated the pay rise issue had urged the executive directors to consider whether Wolfowitz was fit to continue in his post as President, in the light of revelations that he broke the rules. Bush&#39;s new nominee has said he looks forward to working with the team of professionals at the Bank, to meet with contributors and borrowers as well as listen to different perspectives on how the Bank can achieve its goals. Zoellick also said that if his nomination is approved, he would work closely with the Bank&#39;s "dedicated and talented staff." During his tenure as US trade representative, Zoellick is reputed to have completed negotiations that brought China and Taiwan into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in addition to enacting and completing Free Trade Agreements with Singapore, Morocco, Chile and Australia. His record also states that he completed FTAs with five nations of Central America and the Dominican Republic, as well as with Bahrain; worked with Congress to enact the Jordan FTA and the Vietnam Trade Agreement. International Organizations and Africa Under Bush&#39;s administration, Zoellick served with Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, as Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs, as well as Counselor to the Department(Under Secretary rank). Meanwhile, in the summary of the report titled "Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People&#39;s Republic of China 2007," the office of the US Secretary of Defense notes that China is undergoing a military transformation and has the greatest potential to compete with the US. "China&#39;s ability to sustain military power at a distance, at present, remains limited but, as noted in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report, it has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional US military advantages," says the report.

The highest previous death toll in Iraq for Fort Lewis soldiers was nine in December 2004. Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif., and Pfc. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami, died Monday when an improvised explosive device went off near them during a foot patrol in Baghdad, the Pentagon said. Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho, died two days earlier in Baghdad when the vehicle he was riding in struck another IED, the Pentagon said. McFall and Sanchez were infantrymen assigned to 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (Stryker Brigade Combat Team). Hester was an infantryman assigned to the other Fort Lewis-based Stryker brigade serving in and around Baghdad, 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. The two brigades represent about 8,000 soldiers serving in and around Baghdad who, along with other Army combat units and Iraqi security forces, are trying to rid the region of insurgents and quell sectarian violence. Command Sgt. Maj. Gerald Williams, who is serving on an interim basis as the posts senior noncommissioned officer, said losing a soldier never is easy, and the Army post grieves with news of each death. The soldiers commitment to continue the fight hasnt wavered and morale remains high, he added. We stand together with each other to make a difference every day, Williams said. McFall joined the Army in October 1994 and served tours in South Korea and Afghanistan. He reported to Fort Lewis for a second time in September 2005. His wife, Emily, said her husband loved listening to classic rock and cooking ribs on the grill. He would tell peers leaving the military that the Army was the easiest job in the world, she said. He loved the brotherhood and his heart beat red, white and blue; there was only one exit, Emily McFall said. Hester and Sanchez were serving in their first combat deployments. Hester enlisted in May 2004 and arrived at Fort Lewis that September, and Sanchez joined Nov. 9, 2005, and came to the Army post in June 2006. Family members for both soldiers couldnt be reached for comment. Today, Fort Lewis will hold a memorial service for Sgt. Iosiwo Uruo, a 27-year-old native of Guam, who died May 24 when his unit came under enemy fire. His will be among the final individual memorial services for soldiers at Fort Lewis. In a May 22 memo obtained by United for Peace Pierce County, Brig. Gen. William Troy, Fort Lewis acting commanding general, wrote that the number of fallen soldiers prevents post officials from conducting individual services. He directed the posts senior chaplain to draft a policy set to take effect next month. Fort Lewis plans to hold a memorial service once a month for its fallen soldiers. The details are still being worked out, Fort Lewis spokesman Joe Piek said. He noted that four services typically are held to honor a fallen soldier. The soldiers unit holds one in theater; a second at the Army post for the greater community that family members sometimes attend; the third organized by family in the soldiers hometown; and the fourth a burial with military honors.

Jobs @ The Day Norwich Soldier&#39;s Death &#39;Great Loss&#39; For Family, Community Another young man from the region has died in Iraq. Once more our bell tolls. Again our hearts collectively ache for a promising young life ended far too soon. First Lt. Keith Heidtman of Norwich died when the Army helicopter he was co-piloting was shot down. He was 24. Lt. Heidtman was a graduate of Norwich Free Academy, where he was an honor student and athlete. He was also a 2005 graduate of the University of Connecticut, participating in the ROTC program. By all accounts, Lt. Heidtman&#39;s life held great promise. He was planning to head to law school after his military commitment ended. He was killed on Memorial Day. Those who gathered for ceremonies on village greens and lined up for local parades did not know then that one local young man had been added to the ranks of the honored dead they were remembering. Lt. Heidtman was one of 10 U.S. soldiers killed that day, all sacrificing their lives to try and bring order to a far-away country seemingly spinning out of control. On that same day two vehicle bombings in Baghdad killed 44 people, and the bodies of 32 men, shot and tortured, were discovered in two locations north and south of that anguished capital. While the parents of the newly dead were beginning a mourning process that will never fully end, Cindy Sheehan, the mother of another fallen soldier, Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, also 24 when killed, said she was withdrawing from her leadership role in the anti-war movement. Discouraged by the congressional vote to continue funding the war, Mrs. Sheehan said she was &#8220;going home for a while to try and be normal.&#8221; The harshest reality, wrote Mrs. Sheehan in an online diary, &#8220;was that Casey did, indeed, die for nothing.&#8221; She was wrong about that. The 3,467 military personnel so far killed during the Iraq conflict have died in service to their country, and that alone is a noble cause. And though many, including this newspaper, were critical of the decision to invade Iraq and have questioned the way it has been prosecuted, that does not make the service and sacrifice of our soldiers any less honorable. They were given the task of bringing down a dictator, and they did. They were then commissioned with providing security to a country divided by ancient religious and tribal animosities, so that democracy could take root. They have tried. Lt. Heidtman, we salute you.

Wed, May 30, 2007 2:57pm EST Send to a friend Russert cited "business and CEO experience" in claiming Romney "looks presidential" On the May 30 edition of NBC&#39;s , co-host Matt Lauer said of former Gov. Mitt Romney (R-MA): "And while showing some strength at the polls ... many say he even looks presidential." Minutes later, NBC News Washington bureau chief Tim Russert told Lauer: "Matt, I think your interview and your analysis is exactly on target. Mitt Romney is seen as someone who looks presidential with the business and CEO experience." As Media Matters for America has documented, numerous other media figures have praised Romney&#39;s appearance or said he looks like a president, including Republican pollster senior writer and political correspondent and assistant managing editor magazine White House correspondent (now chief political correspondent for From the May 30 broadcast of NBC&#39;s LAUER: He&#39;s a Republican candidate running for president who raised $23 million in the first quarter of the campaign. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Welcome to Harvey&#39;s. ROMNEY: Thank you. How are you today? LAUER: And while showing some strength at the polls -- UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN [video clip]: Oh, we came here to see you. many say he even looks presidential. ROMNEY [video clip]: Nice to meet you. LAUER: However, former governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney is very much still a man trying to define himself, especially on the question of his faith. ROMNEY [video clip]: I&#39;m convinced that America&#39;s days are brighter in the future even than they have been in the past. LAUER: You talk sometimes in a room -- and I just listened to you a little bit -- you talk about your business experience, you know, what -- you know, the kind of CEO-slash-politician. I remember George [W.] Bush, who was running for president, talked about his business experience also. What do you bring to the table that&#39;s different? ROMNEY: Well, every person is different. Just because people are in the same party or have a background that&#39;s similar doesn&#39;t mean they are the same people. LAUER [voice-over]: The war in Iraq was not part of Romney&#39;s speech at a local high school, but one student did put him on the spot. RUSSERT: Matt, I think your interview and your analysis is exactly on target. Mitt Romney is seen as someone who looks presidential, with the business and CEO experience . I think that the reason he&#39;s under the microscope is that some of his positions that he took as governor have evolved now that he&#39;s become a more conservative presidential candidate. 1 - 20 | Didn&#39;t he also call the current president the CEO president? / Wednesday May 30, 2007 03:00:59 PM EST Reply to this comment Funny, but I was sort of thinking the same thing myself.

The Kennedy campaign discovered that Ampad, a company purchased by Romney&#39;s Bain Capital in 1992, had recently bought SCM, an office products company in Marion, Indiana. All 350 workers at the SCM plant were laid off, then offered their jobs back at reduced wages. They went on strike. The Kennedy campaign sent a crew to Marion to film the workers. A half dozen ads resulted from the interviews, most of them quoting workers denouncing Romney for lining his pockets at their expense. A women tells viewers: "I&#39;d like to say to the people of Massachusetts, if you think it can&#39;t happen to you, think again, because we thought it couldn&#39;t happen here either."

He speaks well, he looks well, he carries himself well.......but that also translate to some as being slick, well packaged, and too polished. And considering his "evolving" positions, I opt for the latter. / Wednesday May 30, 2007 03:07:58 PM EST Reply to this comment Sorry Tommy. I have to disagree with you on this one.

Either Russert gets to have an opinion on the looks of a candidate, or media guys and gals should be opinionless on air (that means Olbermann too!).

Republicans are throwing Chimpy under the bus pretty easily these days. / Wednesday May 30, 2007 03:23:06 PM EST Reply to this comment Exactly, unless one can prove that Romney&#39;s business experience makes him look "un-presidential", this is just an opinion that MMFA doesn&#39;t share. / Wednesday May 30, 2007 03:18:24 PM EST Reply to this comment You can&#39;t prove a negative (un-presidential). And that&#39;s not the point. MMFA seems to be delving into the psychology of presidential campaign reporting as it pertains to Republican candidates. Put another way, how many times will some media personality utter similar hollow claims about a Democratic candidate&#39;s qualifications? Godot will show his face first. / Wednesday May 30, 2007 03:32:21 PM EST Reply to this comment What I would hope the point is, although no one has addressed it yet, is that "news" programs are spending time discussing who "looks presidential" instead of what any of their policies may entail if elected. / Wednesday May 30, 2007 03:56:09 PM EST Reply to this comment 1 - 20 | Post a new comment You must be a registered user to post and flag comments on this site. to post in this forum.

Bush, in a counter-offer to European leaders on climate change, proposed convening a new round of talks with the world&#39;s biggest economies to set targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. In a speech today in Washington, the president softened his past opposition to setting global goals to cut the pollution that is causing the Earth&#39;s atmosphere to warm without saying what targets should be adopted or how they should be met. ``My proposal is this: By the end of next year America and other nations will set a long-term global goal for reducing greenhouse gases,&#39;&#39; Bush said in an address that set out the U.S. agenda during next week&#39;s meeting of the Group of Eight industrial nations in Heiligendamm, Germany. The talks would ``establish a new framework&#39;&#39; for when the Kyoto Protocol on emissions expires in 2012. Bush is heading into the G-8 summit having rejected a proposal by host German Chancellor Angela Merkel to set a target of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), effectively cutting emissions to half of 1990 levels by 2050. The administration also opposes a cap-and-trade system, favored by Europeans, that would allow the buying and selling of credits to meet carbon dioxide targets. By proposing to convene talks on climate change, Bush is positioning the U.S. to begin negotiations on the next steps to take. The president&#39;s critics said the administration was still trailing behind allies, state officials and U.S. companies in addressing global warming. ``The White House is just trying to hide the fact that the president is completely isolated among the G-8 leaders by calling vaguely for some agreement next year, right before he leaves office,&#39;&#39; said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust. The proposal addresses one of Bush&#39;s objections to the 1997 Kyoto agreement, which required industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2012, by including India and China. Bush pulled the U.S. out of the accord. ``To develop this goal, the United State will convene a series of meetings of nations that produce the most greenhouse gas emissions, including nations with rapidly growing economies like India and China,&#39;&#39; Bush said. ``In addition to his long- term global goal, each country would establish mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs.&#39;&#39; The climate change initiative that Bush proposed, under his 18-month timeline, would likely be among the last international agreements of his two-term administration. He&#39;s scheduled to leave office in January 2009. Bush said the U.S.-led climate change talks would include industry leaders so that technological advances are part of the solution. ``We need to harness the power of technology to help nations meet their growing energy needs while protecting the environment and addressing the challenge of global climate change,&#39;&#39; Bush said. Bush&#39;s plan may help head off criticism from European leaders that the U.S. refuses to go along with a proposal to set specific targets to help mitigate global warming. Concerned that mandatory cuts would hurt the economy, Bush had maintained support for new technologies and investment in alternative fuels such as ethanol to help curb harmful emissions. In his speech Bush outlined his broader agenda for the G-8 meeting and emphasized his initiatives on AIDS prevention and treatment in poor nations, fighting malaria and the need to finish work on a global trade accord that will open markets for developing nations as well as the world&#39;s richest. ``Trade will improve lives a lot faster than government aid can,&#39;&#39; Bush said. ``The United States will take the lead in making sure those markets are open.&#39;&#39; At the G-8 meeting, Bush said he would argue that lowering trade barriers also would help address energy and environmental challenges. ``If you are truly committed to helping the environment, nations need to get rid of their tariffs, need to get rid of those barriers that prevent new technologies from coming into their countries,&#39;&#39; he said. Bush said U.S. aid to developing nations has more than doubled during his presidency, from more than $10 billion in 2001 to $23 billion in 2006. He said it was the largest increase since the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II. Earlier this week, Bush imposed U.S. economic sanctions against Sudan in a bid to curb the violence in Darfur and called on the United Nations to step up financial pressure on Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir. Yesterday, Bush asked Congress to approve $30 billion during the next five years to mount a more aggressive campaign against the spread of AIDS worldwide, particularly in sub- Saharan Africa. The request would double the current U.S. program of $15 billion, which expires in 2008, and extend it to 2013, five years after Bush leaves office. The G-8 countries are the U.S., Japan, Germany, the U.K., France, Italy, Canada and Russia. The U.S. economy accounts for about 45 percent of the group&#39;s $29.3 trillion in annual economic output.

Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, center, toast with a glass of orange juice with supporter Mike DeMaria, right, during a visit to Broadway Grill in Burlingame, Calif., Wednesday, May 30, 2007.(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) BURLINGAME, Calif. - Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday declared that California's early primary has made the state more than a political ATM , just as he accepted a check from a supporter and then headed to two fundraisers. California's Feb. 5 presidential primary seemed to be having a modest effect, with several major candidates blending their fundraising chores with campaign stops to greet potential voters. Mostly, however, the focus was on fundraising. Democrats John Edwards and Hillary Rodham Clinton also trolled the nation's most delegate-rich state for cash and votes Wednesday. Between them, the three candidates held six California money events. Edwards, during an appearance between the four fundraisers he is holding over two days, decried the influence of money on politics and called for public financing of campaigns. "I'm not holier-than-thou about this. I've raised millions of dollars in 2004 and now to run for president," he added. "But that doesn't mean I think the system is good, because I don't." Giuliani stepped off a plane at San Francisco International Airport and promptly went to the Broadway Grill a few minutes away to chat with customers. His campaign ensured the lunchtime visit was stacked with supporters, sending out an e-mail Wednesday morning urging them to stop by the cafe en route to the fundraiser. Those crowded into the restaurant appeared to be a mix of regulars in T-shirts and committed supporters clad in suits and ties and bound for the fundraiser, which cost $250 and up. George Yerby handed the candidate a check for $200 on the spot. Giuliani hastily passed it to an aide. "He's going to be the next president," Yerby, 67, who lives in the wealthy Bay area enclave of Hillsborough, said afterward. "I hope." Giuliani closed his fundraisers here and in Beverly Hills to the public and news media. The restaurant stop, where he sipped orange juice and coffee, was open. He acknowledged to reporters outside the grill that raising money "has always been a big focus in California, like it was in New York." "One of the complaints that New Yorkers have had, and that Californians have had, is 'They come here, they take our money, but they don't campaign here.'," he said. "So now, they're going to get both , they're going to get us coming here and trying to get your money, but also coming here and campaigning." California is one of 15 states to move its primary to Feb. 5, and others are considering it. Its primary for state candidates will remain in June 2008. Giuliani promised to return regularly if he captures the GOP presidential nomination. "I think I'm the one Republican candidate who has a legitimate chance of winning California. That's based on the polls," he said. A Field Poll of California voters in March suggested otherwise. It showed GOP rival Sen. John McCain running stronger against Edwards and Clinton in hypothetical head-to-head matchups. McCain and Giuliani trailed Democratic candidate Barack Obama by identical margins, and also were behind Clinton and Edwards. Edwards headlined a fundraiser in San Francisco on Wednesday, headed to a second one Wednesday evening in the Bay area suburb of Atherton and planned two more Thursday. During an appearance at the headquarters of search-engine leader Google, Edwards said the current system of paying for campaigns is "dysfunctional." "The way we finance political campaigns in this country, it couldn't be more unhealthy," Edwards told about 1,000 Google employees. He called for taxpayer-financed campaigns , the only way, he said, to "literally pull the life out of these big groups , people that have a huge presence in Washington, lobbying groups." The former senator from North Carolina was the fourth presidential candidate to submit to questioning by executives and staffers of Google.

The next act is expected to play out much the same next week, when the world&#8217;s most powerful economic leaders meet at the G-8 Summit in Germany to discuss the world&#8217;s climate and what should be done to stabilize it. Today, Bush proposed a new plan for climate that has been criticized as &#8220;a charade. Europe and Japan want strict caps on greenhouse gas emissions. Developing countries only want to shoulder the burden for their relatively recent contributions to the problem, and they want to see historic polluters pony up. The U.S. stands alone in its resistance to most any action. Meanwhile, states and cities, celebrities, companies and households are taking action. The willpower to act seems everywhere present but the White House. Extreme Weather Takes Toll On Crops Offshore Oil Rigs Ready For Storms Copyright 2007 The Christian Science Publishing Society G-8 to take up climate change Brad Knickerbocker Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor The international squabble over climate change - who's to blame and how to deal with it - is coming to a boil as many of the major players prepare to meet in Germany next week. In essence, Europe and Japan want stricter controls on greenhouse gases and a faster timetable for reducing them. Major developing countries, China and India, say advanced Western industrialized nations need to make the first cuts; and the United States increasingly looks like the Lone Ranger as it resists diplomatic efforts to join in a coordinated plan to battle global warming. The differences became apparent earlier this week when the environmental group Greenpeace leaked documents "showing the United States has raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration" for next week's Group of Eight summit, according to the French press service AFP. Germany is hosting the G-8 meeting in Heiligendamm June 6-8. The G-8 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain, and the United States, with the 27-nation European Union (EU) participating as well. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to secure a major climate change deal, including agreement to slow the rise in average temperatures this century to 2 degrees Celsius, a cut in global greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and an increase in energy efficiency in power generation and transportation of 20 percent by 2020, the BBC reported. But the US has raised objections to a draft communique prepared for the summit, reports the BBC and other news sources, quoting documents first released by Greenpeace. "The changes strike out entire sentences and significantly reduce the certainty with which the statement addresses climate change," reports the BBC. In red ink, American negotiators wrote: "The US still has serious, fundamental concerns about this draft statement.... The treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses 'multiple red lines' in terms of what we simply cannot agree to.... We have tried to 'tread lightly' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the German position." China and India have joined the US in opposing strict international agreements to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Said Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, following a meeting this week with EU officials in Hamburg, Germany, as reported by AFP: "Our position is that we are a developing nation, and climate change is not the doing of developing countries, though every country has to do what it can to help the environment.... "China's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world, and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line, so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment." China is not a member of the G-8 but was invited to the summit along with Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa. on the subject echo China's. Pradipto Ghosh, India's environment secretary, was quoted May 28 by the Press Trust of India news agency as saying "Legally mandated measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are likely to have significant adverse impacts on GDP growth of developing countries, including India. [Plans to cut greenhouse gases could also have] serious implications for our poverty-alleviation programs. This is not the path we want to pursue." African countries will not be directly involved in next week's G-8 discussions on global warming. But their interests are being voiced by Oxfam, the British aid and relief organization. Rich countries are obliged to help developing countries adapt to climate change, Oxfam asserts - an effort that could cost at least $50 billion a year, reported Britain's Financial Times. Said Oxfam senior researcher Kate Raworth: "This is not about aid, it is about the world's biggest and richest polluters covering the costs forced upon those who are most vulnerable.... Developing countries cannot and should not be expected to foot the bill for the impact of rich countries' emissions." Beginning with its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the US has resisted international controls on its energy production and use - particularly as they relate to climate change. The US has aired two chief objections: that major developing countries (including China) are wrongly exempted from its targets and timetables for reducing greenhouse gases and that the Kyoto agreement would harm the US economy. US officials voiced those concerns this week in Darwin, Australia, where representatives of the 21 Pacific Rim countries making up the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum met to plan the group's summit in September, where climate change will be a key issue. Said US Deputy Secretary of Energy Clay Sell, as quoted by the Associated Press: "Each country brings its own unique circumstances, its own assets, its limitations.... A strong economy is the key enabler to addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions." Along with the US, Australia (the fourth-largest coal producer in the world) has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. At the Darwin meeting, the two countries said they want to discuss ways to develop clean technologies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions before any carbon-reduction schemes are considered. Said Australian Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane: "Once we know how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the challenge will then be to have those technologies employed and to set targets."

The step made final an increase first proposed in January, and drew a new outcry from immigration lawyers and advocacy groups. Skip to next paragraph Bush Calls Attacks on Immigration Bill Empty Political Rhetoric Overhaul of Immigration Law Could Reshape New York The announcement by the agency, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, followed its review of some 3,900 letters it received during a two-month period for public comment. Given those comments  posted online at  the agency made minor adjustments to its proposal, unveiled on Jan. 31. Among the many fees that will rise is the one for a legal immigrant to apply to become a United States citizen; it will increase 66 percent, to $675 from $405. An immigrant applying to become a legal permanent resident will pay $1,010, a 155 percent increase over the current $395 fee. To limit the cost increases for immigrant families with children, the fee for each child 14 years and under who applies with at least one parent to become a legal permanent resident was set at $600. That is a 25 percent reduction from the agencys proposal. But the $1,010 fee for adults is a slight increase, of $25, over the proposal. The agency also said it would waive fees for victims of human trafficking, for refugees who are granted asylum in the United States, for some teenage immigrants and for immigrants fleeing domestic abuse who seek residency under the terms of the Violence Against Women Act. Fees for a visa for a child adopted from a foreign country will increase to $700 from $545. But for parents facing long waits for children, the agency said, it will extend the adoption visa petitions once at no cost. The agency said it would use the additional revenue to improve efficiency and upgrade its buildings and computer systems, and officials promised to reduce the average time for processing visa applications by 20 percent by the fall of 2009. As a matter of policy, the agency pays its annual operating costs, which vary by year, from its fees. Its officials rejected calls from some immigrant groups that Congress be asked to provide money to offset some fee increases, said Chris Bentley, a spokesman for the agency. Leaders of immigration advocacy groups said the higher fees would discourage legal immigrants from becoming American citizens. One such critic was William Ramos, director of the Washington office of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, a group that has been leading a naturalization drive for legal immigrants in Los Angeles. This is a fundamentally flawed system of financing our immigration services, Mr. Ramos said. It places an unfair burden on folks who want to become citizens and participate in all the nation has to offer. Immigration lawyers predicted that the increases would in effect disenfranchise many legal immigrants who might otherwise vote in 2008. A large proportion of people eligible for citizenship are low-wage workers, and they will have to save their pennies to pay these fees, said Crystal Williams, deputy director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The practical effect will be that they are going to miss the 2008 election. The director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Emilio T. Gonzalez, was ready to announce the increases last month, but held off until Senate and White House negotiators could reach agreement on a bipartisan bill to overhaul the immigration system, administration officials said. If the Senate bill becomes law, the agency will face an immense new workload. Among other measures, the bill includes provisions to eliminate the current backlog of four million visa applications within eight years. Mr. Gonzalez said yesterday that the fee increases were both fair to our customers and vital to our nation as we continue to build a secure and efficient national immigration service. More Articles in Washington &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

"So my proposal is this: By the end of next year, America and other nations will set a long-term global goal for reducing greenhouse gases," Bush said in a speech outlining his agenda at next month's meeting of leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized nations in Germany. The talks would include China and India, the developing world's fast growing economies that are also among the top emitters of greenhouse gases. Bush said the United States would convene a series of meetings aimed at setting a global goal while requiring each country to establish mid-term national targets. The talks come after the White House resisted calls for global emissions-reduction goals over the first six years of the Bush presidency. Bush, in his speech, emphasized technological efforts aimed at improving energy efficiency. "The world is on the verge of great breakthroughs that will help us become better stewards of the environment," Bush said. "Over the past six years, my administration has spent, along with the Congress, more than $12 billion in research on clean energy technology. We're the world's leader when it comes to figuring out new ways to power our economy and be good stewards of the environment." William L. Watts is a reporter for MarketWatch.

In his first State of the City address since Hurricane Katrina, Nagin said "New Orleans is coming back, whether you like it or not." Nagin called on President Bush and Governor Kathleen Blanco to do more to help speed the city's recovery. He said Bush has failed to move federal aid to "the people who need it the most." And he said the president should forgive millions of dollars in disaster loans the city took out after the storm to help it to continue operating. A White House spokeswoman said the city, not the federal government, must be the force behind the recovery effort. Nagin also called on Blanco to use a state budget surplus to help the city.

(AP) - Jury selection begins today in a case that's haunted Mississippi for more than four decades. A reputed Ku Klux Klansman, James Seale, is charged with kidnapping and conspiracy in connection with the killings of 2 black teenagers, Charles Moore and Henry Dee. They were abducted while hitchhiking and killed in May of 1964. Their bodies were discovered during the search for three missing civil rights workers, who were later found murdered. Seale and another man were arrested in 1964 but the FBI was consumed by the other investigation and handed over the Dee-Moore case to local authorities who threw out all the charges. The feds last re-opened the case in 2005. The man arrested with Seale in 1964 has been granted immunity and is expected to testify at the trial. Charles Moore's brother says relatives are "at the doorstep of justice." Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, speaks during a news conference before the session in the Texas House of Representatives Sunday in Austin. Rep. Pitts is one of several who have announced they would seek to unseat House Speaker Tom Craddick, R-Midland. House rebellion continues, Craddick unwavering AUSTIN &#8212; Embattled House Speaker Tom Craddick clung unwavering to his leadership Sunday as he entered day three of a showdown with House rebels who want to kick him out of office. The session ends Monday and if Craddick can maintain the post until then, he&#8217;ll have won this round. But getting through Sunday could be tumultuous for the troubled House. That&#8217;s because they have to pass the &#036;153 billion two-year state budget &#8212; the only legislation they&#8217;re legally required to pass. And anti-Craddick forces want to reject the budget when it comes up for a vote later Sunday, forcing 30-day special session to reconsider it. &#8220;I believe we owe it to Texans to do that,&#8221; said Rep. Jim Pitts, a Waxahachie Republican. &#8220;We&#8217;re here to be conservative with the people&#8217;s money.&#8221; Pitts, who has announced his candidacy to replace Craddick as speaker, says Craddick is using his power to insert pork in the budget to influence the speaker&#8217;s race. &#8220;This budget has grown our of control. It is full of wasteful and unnecessary spending,&#8221; Pitts said. The 150-member House elected Craddick to be their leader when the session started in January. But many have grown increasingly disenchanted with his win-at-all-costs approach to leading the chamber. Tensions peaked Friday night when Craddick announced that he would not recognize anyone to make a parliamentary motion to vote him out of office 18 months before his third term expires. When Craddick cut off discussion, chaos broke out and sergeants-at-arms restrained insurgents trying to overtake the speaker&#8217;s podium and the House parliamentarian resigned on the verge of tears. Since then, proceedings have been a parliamentary battle of wills &#8212; as long as Craddick didn&#8217;t recognize opponents to kick him out of office, the 150-member chamber couldn&#8217;t vote to do so. That didn&#8217;t stop opponents from trying again Sunday. Craddick listened to questions from the back microphone, but repeatedly cited the same House rule that he&#8217;s been using since Friday to support his refusal to recognize lawmakers to make a parliamentary motion to oust him. &#8220;I hope the speaker will reconsider his position on that,&#8221; said Democratic Rep. Mark Strama, an Austin Democrat. It &#8220;undermines the fundamental principles of government in this country.&#8221; Craddick&#8217;s supporters pleaded for an end to the gamesmanship, reminding House members that time was running out for them to finish passing legislation. &#8220;Is there any way we can get on with doing the people&#8217;s business as opposed to some people&#8217;s personal agendas?&#8221; asked Rep. Bill Zedler, an Arlington Republican. &#8220;That&#8217;s up to the members Mr. Zedler,&#8221; Craddick replied. Copyright &copy; 2007 All Rights Reserved The Herald Democrat

Now, reputed Ku Klux Klansman James Ford Seale is about to stand trial in Jackson on the first-ever federal kidnapping and conspiracy charges connected to the 1964 slayings of the black teenagers in southwest Mississippi. Jury selection is scheduled to start Wednesday. "We're at the doorstep of justice," said Charles Moore's brother, Thomas Moore, a 63-year-old Army veteran who lives in Colorado Springs, Colo. Thomas Moore and two of Dee's sisters&mdash;Thelma Collins, 70, of Springfield, La.; and Mary Nell Byrd, 61, of Natchez, Miss.&mdash;spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday in Jackson during an interview arranged by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. documentary maker David Ridgen. Since 2005, Ridgen and Thomas Moore have pushed federal officials to reopen the cold case. Ridgen's film, "Mississippi Cold Case," is set to air at 10 p.m. Saturday on MSNBC. Collins said Tuesday that her younger brother, a quiet teenager, spent two weeks with her at her home in Albany, La., shortly before he disappeared. She is the oldest of five siblings and Henry was the youngest; she still calls him "the baby." She moved away from the family home in Mississippi when she was 17 and he was still small. During their last visit, she said Dee quickly became friends with young people who lived nearby. Collins said the family had a pleasant two weeks together. Then, he was gone forever. "I try not to think about it so much because, you know, it's done now," Collins said of her brother's death. "But every time I think about it, I shed a tear." Byrd, like her brother, is quiet. During the interview Tuesday, she spoke barely above a whisper. All three relatives say it's possible they'll testify during the Seale trial. Dee and Charles Moore were not troublemakers, their families say. They were just two 19-year-olds&mdash;friends from school in Franklin County and from Mount Olive Baptist Church in the tiny Kirby Community&mdash;who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. On May 2, 1964, Dee and Moore were picked up while hitchhiking near Meadville when carloads of Ku Klux Klansmen were chasing rumors of a possible armed insurrection by black people in the area. Recent court records said Dee and Charles Moore were taken to the Homochitto National Forest and beaten, then they were stuffed into a trunk and driven more than 70 miles to the Mississippi River near Vicksburg. They were weighted down with engine parts and dumped, still breathing, into the Mississippi River. Their decomposing bodies were found more than two months later, when authorities were conducting a massive search for civil-rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, who disappeared from central Mississippi's Neshoba County on June 21, 1964. "My thing is, Charles Moore and Henry Dee wasn't bothering anybody," Thomas Moore said Tuesday. "And for them to be butchered, tormented, hassled and drowned in the river&mdash;it was pretty bad." Seale and reputed KKK member Charles Marcus Edwards were arrested in 1964 in the deaths of Dee and Moore. But the FBI was consumed by the "Mississippi Burning" investigation from Neshoba County, and the Dee-Moore case was turned over to local authorities, who promptly threw out all charges against Seale and Edwards. The Justice Department in 2000 reopened an investigation. The FBI has said the case was closed in 2003 and opened again in 2005. Edwards has been granted immunity and is expected to testify for the prosecution. Thomas Moore said he asked his mother in 1964 what she wanted him to do about the death of his brother, 13 months younger, whom he called "Nub." "She said, 'Don't you do anything because ... the Lord will provide,'" Moore said. She died in 1977, and Thomas Moore over the years tried to interest authorities in reopening an investigation. "I think my mom is dancing in glory," Thomas Moore said. "I think Charles Moore and Henry Dee are walking among the flowers saying, 'Thank God for Thomas Moore and David Ridgen.'" Collins and Moore said they're prepared for any outcome in the Seale trial. "I just have it in my heart that they're going to do the right thing," Collins said. Moore has already planned what he'll do after the trial, regardless of the outcome. "The last thing that I'm going to do when I leave Mississippi," he said, "I'm going to go to that cemetery, that Mount Olive Cemetery, I'm going to tell Charles Moore, 'I told you that I see it to the end.'"

Bush: A major Presidential decision was greeted with bipartisan praise and international congratulations. By picking former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick on May 30 to replace Paul Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank, Bush made a symbolic and substantive statement that he hoped to unify the controversy-wracked institution and put Wolfowitz's divisive, two-year tenure quickly behind him. Wolfowitz resigned his position, effective June 30, amid ethics questions raised by his role in securing a generous compensation package for his girlfriend (see BusinessWeek.com, 5/17/07, "More Problems After Wolfowitz" An Expert in Diplomacy Zoellick, like Wolfowitz, is known as an accomplished academic and a demanding boss. But unlike the combative Wolfowitz, the prospective bank president has a reputation as an expert in diplomacy and international banking. Zoellick, 53, served as a top State Dept. official under President Bush, and the top Treasury Department official on international economic matters. He was also President George H.W. Bush's top adviser for two Group of Seven international economic summits, as well as a managing director at Goldman Sachs ( ) and chairman of the company's international advisers department. His global economic expertise includes work on issues from Latin American debt relief and German reunification to Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization and restructuring U.S. aid programs for Africa. Democratic Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, lauded Zoellick as "the right person for this job." Said Baucus: "It's hard to imagine a more intelligent, hard-working, and capable person to assume the bank's leadership at this difficult point in its history. Bob has the skills and the integrity to put the bank back on the right path." Not Much of a Honeymoon House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) praised Zoellick's efforts to bring peace to war-torn Darfur, calling him a sensitive and caring person. Even Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.), Bush's vanquished 2004 Presidential rival, says Zoellick "brings a diverse range of skills and international experience to the position" and hopes he "can regain the confidence of employees and donor nations that was lost under the previous leader." Kind words aside, Zoellick can't expect much of a honeymoon in his new job as the bank's 11th president in its 60-year history. Bank-watchers say he has a lot of work to do to soothe the hard feelings generated by Wolfowitz, whose role as an architect of the Bush Administration's Iraq policy rankled European allies and bank staffers. "His major initial challenge is to rebuild the morale of the organization and to bring someone with a strong management background in to put things back together again in a better way than before," says Edwin "Ted" Truman, senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Center for International Economics. During the White House announcement ceremony, Bush and Zoellick both alluded to the recent divisions and the challenges ahead. Zoellick, said Bush, "has earned the trust and support of leaders from every region of the world." Zoellick declared that "we need to approach this task with humility and creative minds." He praised the World Bank staff that warred with Wolfowitz as "many fine professionals from all over the world." "The World Bank has passed through a difficult time for all involved," Zoellick said during the nine-minute event in the Roosevelt Room. "There are frustrations, anxieties, and tensions about the past that could inhibit the future. This is understandable, but not without remedy. We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to focus on the future together."

Letters to the Editor As Lake O level falls, so does business Lake O 'waiting for the rain' Okeechobee fishing guide and bait and tackle store owner discuss the effects of low water levels on the area. OKEECHOBEE &#151; Bubba Helton wonders how long he can keep his doors open. Larry Wright would love to take someone fishing. Wendy Woodman figures it's going to be a slow Fourth of July holiday. Lake Okeechobee tied a record low water level Wednesday &#151; 8.97 feet above sea level. But the water level isn't the only thing hitting bottom in this part of Central Florida. Businesses around the northern rim of the nation's second- largest freshwater lake also are seeing record lows. Retail sales, dinners served at area restaurants, motel/campsite bookings and rentals are well off the mark following a slower than average season &#151; January through April. And the summer slowdown might spell the end for some businesses. Helton blames a large portion of his lost business on mismanaged water and mis-modeled weather forecasting. "The Army Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water Management District don't know how to run the business they're in," said Helton, owner of Garrard's Bait and Tackle on 441 in Okeechobee. "For 18 months they dumped water out of the lake, and then we went into a natural drought." The low water levels have prevented anglers from taking fishing trips on Florida's most famed fishing lake. Although the fishing is good for bass and bluegill, almost no one can get out onto the lake since the waters have receded to the point where boat ramps empty onto dry ground. Helton said he knows of three tackle shops around the lake that already have closed their doors because of waning customer traffic, and he might not be that far behind if business doesn't pick up soon. Wright, a captain who has guided anglers to lunker largemouth bass for 26 years, hopes he can continue to make a living despite what he estimates as a 75 percent drop in charters. "In May last year, I worked 26 days," said Wright, 55. "This year, I had 10." He had 21 trips last June, but has only three on the books this year. Wright said few customers are coming from other states to fish because of the low water. "We get quite a few anglers from South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama who come here to fish this time of year," he said. "The moms and dads will get their high school kids fishing trips. They're just not coming. "They may think the lake is just completely dried up." Woodman, general manager of the K.O.A. Campground in Okeechobee, said the Memorial Day weekend wasn't too bad for bookings; however, Fourth of July reservations are off quite a bit. "Our business is impacted a little bit," Woodman said, "but we have guests who come here for activities besides fishing and boating." The way Helton sees it, the entire economy of Okeechobee is tied directly or indirectly to the level of the lake. "This doesn't only affect me," Helton said. "Motels, gas stations, grocery stores, even Wal-Mart has slower sales when the traffic is down." And Helton's unhappiness doesn't end with the water managers. "We've been let down by our county commissioners, congressmen, senators and governor," Helton said. "I don't care if there's a three-legged dog running in the next election, I'm voting against all of them." 3 (bookings to date) 41 bass, 48 bluegill and shellcracker 31 bass to 8 pounds Forecasters with the National Weather Service predict a roughly 40 percent chance of rain on Friday and a 50 percent chance of rain on Saturday. The South Florida Water Management District says even if it does rain, it would have to fall directly over the lake to help it rebound. Bubba Helton wonders how long he can keep his doors open.

Chance of a challenge to Bush's man Bob Zoellick: The world in his hands. US PRESIDENT George Bush's nominee as head of the World Bank, Bob Zoellick, is virtually certain to be ratified by the bank's board after June 15. But developing nations could nominate a candidate as a protest against the convention that gives the US the right to name the bank's head. President Bush said Mr Zoellick had a distinguished career in diplomacy and development economics. "He's a committed internationalist," he said. "He is deeply devoted to the mission of the World Bank. He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty, to grow their economics and offer their people the hope of a better life." The World Bank board said it welcomed the nomination of Mr Zoellick, a former diplomat and economist, who has served as US deputy secretary of state, and former special trade representative in the Bush Administration. But it reiterated its stance that nominations were open until June 15 and board meetings would be held to consider all nominations. This leaves open the possibility of a repeat of events at the International Monetary Fund in 2004 when a group of developing nations put forward another candidate against the European nominee, Rodrigo de Rato. The move would be little more than a protest because Germany, which led the charge for the removal of the former president Paul Wolfowitz, is believed to have indicated that Mr Zoellick would be acceptable. In Canberra, Treasurer Peter Costello said Mr Zoellick would be "an excellent candidate". The French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, also backed the appointment. "Mr Zoellick is certainly the right man for the job," he said. But he said Mr Zoellick would need to regain the trust of the international community following the Wolfowitz scandal. The World Bank has been paralysed by controversy over Mr Wolfowitz's handling of a pay package for his girlfriend. But long before that, Mr Wolfowitz was seen as a controversial character, particularly by the European representatives on the bank because of his role in driving the Iraq war policies of the Bush Administration. Even this week, Mr Bush was still backing Mr Wolfowitz, describing him as "an able public servant" and "a man of character and integrity". But in the bank, Mr Wolfowitz proved a divisive figure &#151; he had strong views about fighting corruption by suspending loans to countries without transparent banking systems &#151; and morale among the 10,000 staff is said to be low. Mr Zoellick promised to tackle that issue: "We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to focus on the future together," he said. Although Mr Zeollick is also a Bush Administration insider, he also enjoys a strong reputation as a capable and intelligent diplomat. He was instrumental as US trade representative in establishing the Doha Round of trade talks, and has been a strong advocate of free trade agreements, including the US-Australia agreement. Mr Zoellick has also been involved in diplomatic efforts in the Darfur region of Africa and other initiatives to fight poverty, something President Bush was keen to highlight. "Bob has had a strong voice for Africa," he said. "He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty to grow their economies and offer their people the hope of better life." But not all are flattering about Mr Zoellick, with his critics pointing to some personal failings, particularly a propensity to tirades and a strong view on almost everything. Mr Zoellick's penchant to lecture, point by point, with little concern for editorial compression, is said to have irritated his boss, Condoleezza Rice, in the State Department, even though she had a huge regard for his intellect.

Critics of the detention centre said the death showed the level of desperation among Guantanamo detainees. In an unrelated incident, a Canadian detainee also fired his American attorneys, leaving him without defence counsel ahead of his trial, his former US military attorney said. The detainee, Omar Khadr, is to be arraigned on Monday and is one of only three of the roughly 380 Guantanamo prisoners to be charged with a crime. The military did not identify the detainee who died or describe the manner of death. There are about 80 detainees from Saudi Arabia held at Guantanamo. Guards at the US Naval Base in southeast Cuba found him in his cell unresponsive and not breathing on Wednesday afternoon, the US military's Southern Command said in a statement. ''They tried to save his life but he was pronounced dead,'' said Mario Alvarez, a Miami-based spokesman for the command. Lawyer Julia Tarver Mason, whose firm represents eight Saudi detainees at Guantanamo, said she has tried so far without success to learn from the government if the apparent suicide was by one of her clients. It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. On June 10 last year, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets. A spokesman for detention operations, Navy Cmdr Rick Haupt, declined to comment, referring questions to the Miami-based Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in the Caribbean and Latin America. Defence attorneys said it was likely an act of desperation at a prison camp where detainees are denied access to US civilian courts and isolated in their cells for up to 22 hours a day. Marc Falkoff, who is part of a team of attorneys representing 17 men from Yemen, said the suicide should be expected given the conditions at Guantanamo. ''We've said all along that these guys are going to try to take their lives and that appears to be what happened here. It's just incredibly sad and it wouldn't happen if these guys were just given their day in court.'' A cultural adviser was helping the military handle the remains. ''The remains of the deceased detainee are being treated with the utmost respect,'' the military said. The death came as the US military prepared to try Khadr and Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni, in military tribunals set up by Congress after the US Supreme Court rejected a previous military trial system, calling it unconstitutional. Their arraignment is scheduled to proceed on Monday at Guantanamo as planned, Navy Cmdr Jeffrey Gordon, a Pentagon spokesman, said late Wednesday. Khadr was 15 when he was captured in a firefight with US troops in Afghanistan in which he allegedly killed a US Army special forces soldier with a grenade. ''He doesn't trust American lawyers, and I don't particularly blame him,'' said US Marine Lt Col Colby Vokey, who was taken off the case Wednesday. ''The United States is responsible for his interrogation, and his treatment under a process that is patently unfair.'' Vokey was excused as defence counsel by Col Dwight Sullivan, chief defence counsel. Khadr is now represented by only two Canadian lawyers, who are known as foreign attorney consultants because they have not been cleared to be full-level attorneys, Vokey said. Under new rules for military tribunals adopted last year, the detainee is permitted to represent himself. The apparent suicide on Wednesday came despite the military's best efforts. It tightened security at the prison camp following the previous suicides and an uprising last spring, removing access to light fixtures and other possible makeshift weapons and taking away bed sheets in the daytime. About 380 men are held at the isolated prison camp on suspicion of links to al-Qaida or the Taliban. Many have been held for five years. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is conducting an ongoing investigation into the three previous suicides. The former commander of the detention facilities, Navy Rear Adm Harry Harris, described those suicides as acts of ''asymmetric warfare'' an effort to increase condemnation of the prison.

Gonzales testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 30, 2007 Cindy Sheehan, the antiwar activist who spent the last two years trying to confront President Bush, courting controversy and traveling around the world in protest of the war in , says she will now try a final tactic: silence. Skip to next paragraph Ms. Sheehan announced on a liberal Web site Monday that she was essentially resigning as the face of the American peace movement, leaving Texas to return to California, her home state, to be a mother to my surviving children and try to regain some of what I lost. This is not my Checkers moment, because I will never give up trying to help people in the world who are harmed by the empire of the good old US of A, but I am finished working in, or outside of this system, Ms. Sheehan wrote in her post on the Web site The Daily Kos. This system forcefully resists being helped and eats up the people who try to help it, she wrote. I am getting out before it totally consumes me or any more people that I love and the rest of my resources. Ms. Sheehans son, Specialist Casey A. Sheehan of the Army, was killed on April 4, 2004, in Iraq. He was 24. His mother captured the nations attention in August 2005 when she arrived at the presidents ranch in Crawford, Tex., and announced that she would not leave until Mr. Bush agreed to meet with her. Ms. Sheehan walked through Crawford that summer carrying pictures of her son as a toddler and in his Army fatigues, humanizing the war dead, who had remained in many ways invisible to large segments of the American public. Her intransigence in the face of Secret Service agents and senior Bush administration officials who tried to mollify her was a crucial element in what at the time was a small and incipient antiwar movement. Ms. Sheehan said in an interview yesterday in Northern California that she had been contemplating leaving the peace movement for more than a year, spurred in part by an illness, fatigue and what she said was her increasing frustration with bloggers on the left who she said attacked her. She also cited divisions within the antiwar movement and a recent vote in Congress to finance the war without setting a deadline for troop withdrawal. One of the things that pushed me over the edge was that people on the left were calling me names, she said. How many kicks in the teeth do you have to endure. She added, I dont have anything left in my personal reservoir. She has been criticized in part for her left-leaning politics and for meeting with , the leftist president of Venezuela. Ms. Sheehan, 49, said in the interview, I feel like a tremendous weight has been lifted. She added, People demonize me; people idolize me; everything I say and do has been scrutinized. Last year, Ms. Sheehan bought property in Crawford with $52,000 in insurance money she had received after her sons death and continued her summer encampments. Ms. Sheehan said she made the decision to leave in consultation Monday in Crawford only with her boyfriend and her sister, DeDe Miller. She said: My sister tried to talk me out of it. She said, Youre just tired. And then she realized I wasnt going to change my mind. Ms. Sheehans protests were not confined to Crawford. She was removed from the visitors gallery of the House of Representatives and arrested for refusing to cover up her antiwar garb before Mr. Bushs State of the Union address in January 2006. She was also convicted of trespassing while trying to deliver an antiwar petition to American diplomats at the Ms. Sheehan said her efforts against the war led to the end of her 29-year marriage and created strains with her three surviving children, who live near her ex-husband in Northern California. A White House spokeswoman refused to comment on Ms. Sheehans decision. A group of Gold Star Family members, parents who have lost children in war, said in a statement, We are very pleased to hear that Cindy Sheehan is ending her disgraceful campaign to discredit the United States military and the heroic men and women in harms way in Iraq and Afghanistan. But her supporters felt stung. I am not sure her decision is really clear to all of us, said Elizabeth Stinson, the director of the Peace and Justice Center of Sonoma County in California. But I am not surprised by the critique at all because were all feeling it with this vote, a reference to passage of the war-financing bill minus the timeline. Ms. Sheehan said she would not return to the antiwar movement, but would like to work in the world of humanitarian aid. Well come back in a different way, she said. Not working with politicians or against politicians. Not working with any kind of political movement at all. More Articles in National &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

May 31, 2007 (AP) Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday declared that California's early primary has made the state more than a political ATM just as he accepted a check from a supporter and then headed to two fundraisers. California's Feb. 5 presidential primary seemed to be having a modest effect, with several major candidates blending their fundraising chores with campaign stops to greet potential voters. Mostly, however, the focus was on fundraising. Democrats John Edwards and Hillary Rodham Clinton also trolled the nation's most delegate-rich state for cash and votes Wednesday. Between them, the three candidates held six California money events. Edwards, during an appearance between the four fundraisers he is holding over two days, decried the influence of money on politics and called for public financing of campaigns. "I'm not holier-than-thou about this. I've raised millions of dollars in 2004 and now to run for president," he added. "But that doesn't mean I think the system is good, because I don't." Giuliani stepped off a plane at San Francisco International Airport and promptly went to the Broadway Grill a few minutes away to chat with customers. His campaign ensured the lunchtime visit was stacked with supporters, sending out an e-mail Wednesday morning urging them to stop by the cafe en route to the fundraiser. Those crowded into the restaurant appeared to be a mix of regulars in T-shirts and committed supporters clad in suits and ties and bound for the fundraiser, which cost $250 and up. George Yerby handed the candidate a check for $200 on the spot. Giuliani hastily passed it to an aide. "He's going to be the next president," Yerby, 67, who lives in the wealthy Bay area enclave of Hillsborough, said afterward. "I hope." Giuliani closed his fundraisers here and in Beverly Hills to the public and news media. The restaurant stop, where he sipped orange juice and coffee, was open. He acknowledged to reporters outside the grill that raising money "has always been a big focus in California, like it was in New York."

Georgia played host to President Bush on Tuesday. The purpose of his visit was to talk about a new compromise on immigration reform. President Bush stopped on Tuesday morning to speak at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, FLETC, in Glynco, which is near Brunswick. President Bush toured the country's largest federal law enforcement training center, known as FLETC. Afterwards, he spoke to the more than 2,000 people about his immigration reform proposal. The crowd was made up of FLETC students, law enforcement officials, as well as immigration and customs officials. &ldquo;I hope that it will build the support that we need to continue the fight that we are so desperately trying to do here." Says Victor Watson a Program Specialist, Counter Terrorism Division at FLETC. 3 On Your Side's Randi Hempel was at Tuesday's presidential visit President Bush's is trying to sell the immigration plan as conservative critics say the bill is too soft on those who break the law. But, the proposal is not an amnesty plan. The 12-million people living in the U.S. illegally have to acknowledge that they're breaking the law and to pay a fine. Those people can apply for a Z visa, which will grant them temporary legal status. In addition to paying a fine, illegal immigrants will have to pass a background check, remain employed and maintain a clean record. Immigrants aren't the only ones who face big changes. Employers who hire illegal workers will face stiff penalties. "The message to employers is if you hire somebody here that you know is illegal. There is a consequence to be paid." The President said. Those penalties are going up, with maximum fines rising to $5,000 for first time offenders, $25,000 for the third offense. The maximum criminal penalty carrying a $75,000 fine per violation. President Bush says he wants both parties to stop the political bickering. "The fundamental issue is will elected officials have the courage necessary to put a comprehensive immigration plan in place that makes it more likely that we can enforce our border and at same time uphold great immigrant traditions of the United States of America.&rdquo; President Bush talked about how the illegal immigrants are doing jobs Americans aren't, like working on farms here in Georgia, but that if they want to work in this country, they must follow the law. The Bush Administration's border security plan has already doubled funding for border security...spending $10.4 billion this year. When he took office in 2001, $4.6 billion was spent. The bill calls for expanding the number of border patol agents. In 2001, there were 9,000, today there are 13,000 and by the end of 2008, there will be more than 18,000 agents. The bill calls for more border fencing, building 370 miles of fencing and 200 miles of vehicle barriers. There are already measures in place to secure the border, but they will be increased. What we already have is 5290 sensors on the southern border, 687 nighttime cameras on the southern border, 449 daytime cameras and 1 unmanned aerial system, with another to be added by July of this year. President Bush says he knows Americans are skeptical about immigration reform because they don't think the problem can be fixed...he just asks that they give it a chance.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) By BECKY BOHRER Associated Press Writer NEW ORLEANS May 31, 2007 (AP) Mayor Ray Nagin, in his first State of the City address since Hurricane Katrina, said Wednesday that New Orleans is a city on the mend, despite broken promises from the state and federal governments. "New Orleans is coming back, whether you like it or not," Nagin said to applause from the crowd of city workers and community members gathered at the National World War II Museum. "And you might as well deal with it." Nagin called on President Bush and Gov. Kathleen Blanco to do more to help speed the city's recovery from the August 2005 storm. He said Bush has failed to move federal aid to "the people who need it the most," and said he should forgive millions of dollars in disaster loans that the city took out after the storm to help it to continue operating. He also called on Blanco to use a budget surplus to help the city. "Use the $3 billion budget surplus to ensure a strong future for our state and for all our citizens," Nagin said. "Because as New Orleans recovers, and as south Louisiana recovers, so does Louisiana." A message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for Blanco. A White House spokeswoman said the city, not the federal government, must be the force behind the recovery effort. "The federal government has committed more than $110 billion to help the Gulf Coast recover, and we will continue to provide assistance. But the people of the Gulf Coast and their elected leaders must drive the effort to rebuild their lives and their communities," said Jeanie Mamo, a spokeswoman for the White House. Nagin referred to the city's challenges, including a storm-depleted police force dealing with a rise in violent crime and a health care system in "crisis," but he also touted what he deemed successes, from the cleanup of the French Quarter to the return of more than half the city's pre-Katrina population of 455,000. He compared his city to a patient written off as dying who eventually recovered. "We have stabilized. We are implementing plans for our future, and we are strong enough for the next phase of recovery the transformation to the new New Orleans," Nagin said.

A hurricane research team has renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season. REUTERS/Carlos Barria MIAMI (Reuters) - The Colorado State University hurricane research team renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season on Thursday and predicted 17 tropical storms, with nine growing to hurricane strength. Of those, five would grow into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher with winds over 110 mph (177 kph), the team founded by forecast pioneer William Gray said in its revised forecast. The updated forecast issued on Thursday was unchanged from the team's April 3 forecast for the six-month storm season that starts on Friday. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) The researchers said there was a 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane would hit the U.S. coastline in 2007, with a 50 percent chance that would happen on the U.S. Atlantic Coast and a 49 percent chance on the Gulf of Mexico coast. An average season brings 11 tropical storms, with six reaching hurricane wind speed of 74 mph (119 kph) and two growing into major hurricanes. Other private and government weather researchers have also predicted a more active season than average. But so far none have forecast anything like a repeat of record-breaking 2005, when 28 tropical storms spawned 15 hurricanes, including Katrina which flooded New Orleans and parts of the Gulf coast.

NAGIN GUILTY OF MALPRACTICE May 31, 2007...Last night, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin delivered his first "State of the City" address since Katrina. He used the opportunity to vigorously defend his administration and blast both the President of the United States and the Governor. Nagin referred to New Orleans as a sick patient that was making a miraculous recovery. Well, if New Orleans is the patient, Nagin is the doctor guilty of malpractice. Last night proved once again, that Nagin will take responsibility for nothing. Concerning the sky-high murder rate, Nagin said it was a "blip." Ladies and gentlemen, the murder capital of the nation has a serious blip problem. Throughout his address, Nagin continued to point fingers at everyone else and accept blame for none of the problems post Katrina. In fact, at the end of the speech, when Nagin abandoned his script, he said that "it's not our fault" that the levees failed, that the water system is broken, that the road home plan is a mess and that "we were stranded and left." Of course in the Mayor's view, it is never his fault; everyone else is to blame for everything. Nagin only takes credit for successes His emotional speech was popular with the crowd of city employees and police recruits. One Nagin partisan admonished me for attending, saying, "I can't believe you are here after the horrible article you wrote about the Mayor." Well, the truth hurts and this is still a free country. The speech was open to the public and not everyone was drinking the Kool-Aid. Several members of the media who attended were disappointed. One commentator told me that the partisan nature of the speech upset her, since Nagin congratulated only the Democratic members of the congressional delegation and specifically praised the Congressional Black Caucus. On the state level, Nagin blasted Blanco for abandoning the health care needs of New Orleans and for not placing more of an emphasis on the coastal areas in her record budget. He said that road home plan has been "misguided." Nagin certainly has a valid point about the lack of help on both the state and federal levels. The President has not lived up to his commitments about New Orleans and Blanco is trying to spread the budget around the state and grow government instead of rebuilding the coastal parishes. Despite the correctness of some of his complaints, Nagin is very misguided in his attempts to secure more help. It would be much better for Nagin to meet regularly with all members of the congressional delegation, both Republicans and Democrats, and work with them as a team to secure more federal dollars. On the state level, Nagin should be visiting Baton Rouge almost every day of the legislative session, working for the city and promoting a legislative agenda instead of traveling around the country to one conference after another. In the audience last night should have been members of the Louisiana Legislature, unfortunately, I did not see a single legislator in attendance. According to one long time observer of Louisiana politics, "Nagin should have chartered a bus and brought down the Louisiana Legislature to be his guests last night." Instead of reaching out to the legislature and the Governor, Nagin blasted them. Since the 2003 race for Governor, the relationship between Blanco and Nagin has been horrible. After last night's speech, it will not be getting any better. By vilifying Bush, Nagin has certainly caused that once warm friendship to turn frosty. Rumors continue to swirl around City Hall that Nagin will run for Governor this fall, in an effort to take his message of recovery and complaints statewide. If that happens, Nagin will soon realize that Louisiana voters have little appetite for a politician evading responsibility and pointing fingers at everyone else. Last night was vintage Nagin, part preacher, part politician. To his political supporters, he will always be a polished orator and an inspiring leader, but to the vast majority of voters, Nagin is a political doctor guilty of malpractice, both for what he has done and has not done for the patient that is the City of New Orleans.

The New Orleans Redevelopment Authority, facing a tight budget and needing money from the city, has put a hold on hiring new staff. Its power to seize and sell properties faces legal uncertainties arising from new state constitutional limits on property seizures. And, nearly halfway through 2007, the agency still has no contract with the city for work this year. Board members have vented at NORA's every-other-week board meetings that they're getting no real work accomplished. NORA wants -- in writing -- specific expectations for its performance along with a $1.2 million commitment from the city to hire staff. The city's recovery director, Ed Blakely, said he expected the group to submit its own proposal for work and funding. Blakely also said his expectations of NORA -- to move bundles of blighted, abandoned or seized property to market as part of a rebuilding plan -- were outlined months ago. . All rights reserved.

AccuWeather Now Streaming LIVE now Cindy Sheehan Quits Anti-War Activism Feels Betrayed, Leaving Democratic Party May 28 - KGO - Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan is calling it quits. The woman who pleaded with President Bush for a face-to-face meeting at his Crawford ranch now wants to part of the fight. She is resigning as the face of the anti-war movement. LINK: Cindy Sheehan's Letter LINK: Daily Kos Blog ABC7 Video On Demand Get Alerts In Your E-Mail Get Alerts On Your Desktop Some bloggers are saying good riddance, but most anti-war activists say they are sorry to see Cindy Sheehan go. They credit her for galvanizing the anti-war movement. Cindy Sheehan became the face of the anti-war movement not too long after her son Casey died in the Iraq War in 2004. She is perhaps best known for leading a protest in front of the president's Texas ranch dubbed "Camp Casey." Nothing seemed to stop Sheehan, even a well-organized group against her called the "You Don't Speak for Me Cindy! Tour." But now the mother from Vacaville has had enough. In the liberal blog, , "I have invested everything I have into trying to bring peace with justice to a country that wants neither." Medea Benjamin is co-founder of the anti-war group Code Pink and a friend of Sheehan. Medea Benjamin, Code Pink Co-founder: "She does break down from time to time, and it's totally understandable. She's been attacked for violating her child's name when who would know better but her what her son would have liked." Sheehan is not only relinquishing her role as one of the leaders of the peace movement, she is also leaving the Democratic Party. Friends say all of this was triggered last week when Democrats on Capitol Hill failed to tie a troop withdrawal timeline to a war funding bill. In a letter to Democrats, Sheehan wrote, "it used to be George Bush's war. You could have ended it honorably. Now it is yours. We gave you a chance. You betrayed us." Although Sheehan now says she'll retreat from activism, others, like anti-war activists Stephen and Virginia Pearcy, believe her departure could spark a new movement. The Pearcys made headlines themselves when they displayed an effigy in front of their Sacramento home two years ago. Virginia Pearcy, anti-war activist: "I think Cindy is leading the way to show us that the answer to ending this home is not going to be found in the Democratic Party, it's not going to be found in the Republican party, and so we're going to have to look elsewhere." We tried getting a hold of Sheehan herself, but she is in Crawford, Texas, honoring what would have been her son Casey's 28th birthday.

The soldiers were killed in two separate attacks in the past week, the Department of Defense said in news releases Wednesday. Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif., and Cpl. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami, died Monday when an explosive detonated nearby during a dismounted patrol in Baghdad. Both were assigned to 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, one of two Fort Lewis Stryker brigades serving in Iraq. On Saturday, Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho, died in Baghdad when his vehicle was hit by a homemade bomb. Hester was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment with the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, Fort Lewis' other Stryker Brigade Combat Team that has been in Iraq since June. Hester had been in the Army three years, joining in May 2004. He arrived at Fort Lewis in September 2004, where he was assigned to the 3rd Brigade. McFall joined the Army in October 1994 and served a year in Korea beginning February 1997. He then reported to Fort Lewis to serve with the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment. In April 2001, McFall was stationed at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and deployed to Afghanistan with the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment from April 2004 through March 2005. He returned to Fort Lewis that September and had served since January with the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment. Sanchez joined the Army in November 2005 and reported to Fort Lewis last June for assignment to the 4th Brigade's 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry. The unit left for Iraq last month. He was posthumously promoted from the rank of private first class. The deaths came as Fort Lewis leaders said they would no longer be holding individual memorial services for soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, a move other military posts have already taken. "As much as we would like to think otherwise, I am afraid that with the number of soldiers we now have in harm's way, our losses will preclude us from continuing to do individual memorial ceremonies," Brig. Gen. William Troy, acting commanding general at Fort Lewis, wrote in a May 22 memo to commanders and staff. A copy of the memo was obtained by United for Peace Pierce County and posted on the group's Web site. Troy asked the post's senior chaplain, Col. Jack Van Dyken, to work out the details of the new policy set to begin next month. There are about 8,000 Fort Lewis-based soldiers in Iraq. "This is not an intent to streamline the process or in any way detract from honoring the soldiers," Van Dyken told The News Tribune on Tuesday. "It's just being cognizant of the fact that when you have this many, the time involved in doing each one individually is just prohibitive." "I see this as a way of sharing the heavy burdens our spouses and rear detachments bear, while giving our fallen warriors the respect they deserve," Troy wrote in his memo. "It will also give the families of the fallen the opportunity to bond with one another, as they see others who share their grief." A total of 127 Fort Lewis soldiers have died in all overseas deployments since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. This month alone, the post has held five memorials for troops killed in Iraq, including one for six soldiers killed in a single attack May 6 in Baqubah. The 4th Brigade is planning a June 5 memorial for four soldiers killed in its first month in Iraq: Staff Sgts. David Kuehl and Kristopher Higdon, Pfc. Robert Worthington and Spc. Mathew LaForest. Other Army posts already consolidating soldier memorials include Fort Carson, Colo., and Fort Hood in Texas.

http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/68047.html&cid Justice Department probe to look into attorney hiring practices Justice Department probe to look into attorney hiring practices Thu, 31 May 2007 15:54:00GMT US World News | WASHINGTON - Justice Department investigators are examining whether the Bush administration interfered with civil service rules when it hired lawyers for the Civil Rights Division on the basis of their political affiliations. The internal probe into the firings of several attorneys that could still hurt Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is also proceeding apace. In joint letters sent to the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Inspector General Glenn Fine and H. Marshall Jarrett confirmed the internal probe was expanded. "We have expanded the scope of our investigation to include allegations regarding improper political or other considerations in hiring decisions within the Department of Justice," they wrote. Jarrett is the chief of the Office of Professional Responsibility. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is already in a tough spot thanks to his alleged role in the attorney firings. While many Republicans have also called for his resignation, Gonzales continues to stay put thanks to the support he is receiving from the White House. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate panel reacted to the expanded inquiry by saying that the incident only highlighted the need for the Congress to oversee the functioning of the Justice Department. The inquiry will look to get to the bottom of how lawyers are hired in the Civil Rights Division and the criteria in place for the same.

Fill out this form to email this article to a friend Rain is in forecast for this weekend Unfortunately, it won&#39;t be enough to end the drought. Published May 31, 2007 A boat launch on Torry Island in Belle Glade, Fla., at the southern tip of Lake Okeechobee has been rendered useless by the low water level on Tuesday, May 29, 2007. The water level in Lake Okeechobee dropped Wednesday to match a historic low, making a boat ramp in Belle Glade useless. Rain -- beautiful, quenching, elusive rain -- is expected for the Tampa Bay area this weekend, which could bring some temporary relief to crispy lawns and wilting flowers. But don&#39;t stop the rain dances, chants and prayers just yet. Forecasters say the two weather systems that will merge over the Gulf of Mexico, possibly as early as Friday, will unload from 3/4- to 1 1/2-inches of rain. That&#39;s not enough to put much of a dent in the continuing drought that is parching most of Florida. "While completely welcome, we need a whole lot more of it," said Robyn Hanke, spokeswoman for the Southwest Florida Water Management District, which regulates water use for a 16-county region and instituted once-a-week watering restrictions in January. "We&#39;ve been saying it for a while, but what we really, really, really need is an above average rainfall this summer." Since January 2006, Pinellas, Pasco, Hillsborough and Polk counties have received about 50 inches of rain, 17 inches below normal. Throughout the area, grass is dying and ponds are sinking. An upper level system should form in the south to central gulf during the next couple of days and should migrate to the east or northeast Friday or Saturday, weather officials say. It could join with another system dropping down from the Mississippi River Valley. "We&#39;ll get moisture from the south and the trough from the north," said Ernie Jillson, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Ruskin. "Wherever those two merge is where the favorable rainfall will be." This isn&#39;t the start of the annual rainy season, however. That usually begins a little later in June. Friday&#39;s forecast calls for a 30 to 40 percent chance of scattered showers and thunderstorms with highs in the upper 80s. Rain chances double to 60 to 70 percent for Saturday, with temperatures in the mid 80s. The rain should taper off by Sunday. It would be the area&#39;s first rain since May 14, when a trace was recorded. Rainfall is especially needed in South Florida, where rain levels are at half the normal. Water levels at Lake Okeechobee tied a historic low Wednesday. The 730-square-mile lake measured 8.97 feet above sea level, matching a previous record set during the 2001 drought. Normally at this time of year it is 14 to 15 feet. The lake is the primary water source for 50,000 area homes and serves as the backup water supply for 7-million households in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties. "The dilemma for us is when the water gets as low as it is, there&#39;s no significant water for backup for the urban areas," said Randy Smith, spokesman for the South Florida Water Management District. "It renders the backup system useless." In Tampa, water department spokesman Elias Franco seemed stunned to hear news of a forecast that included rain. "I don&#39;t believe it," he said, half-jokingly. The city of Tampa has been buying water from Tampa Bay Water since late last year because of low levels in the Hillsborough River, the city&#39;s primary source of drinking water. Any rain is needed, Franco said, but it will not help much in the long run. "We are so in arrears right now," he said. "It&#39;s really not going to make an impact or change any conditions we&#39;re wrestling with. Even a normal rainy season will put us behind for next year."

WASHINGTON -- Justice Department investigators have told Congress that an internal probe of the firings of U.S. attorneys has been widened to include a broader examination of hiring practices at the sprawling department, including the troubled Civil Rights Division, and programs for beginning lawyers. "We have expanded the scope of our investigation to include allegations regarding improper political or other considerations in hiring decisions within the Department of Justice," Inspector General Glenn Fine and H. Marshall Jarrett, head of the Office of Professional Responsibility, wrote in joint letters to the House and Senate Judiciary committees. A spokesman for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales declined to comment on the broadening of the probe. The rare letter updating lawmakers on a Justice investigation comes a week after the department's former White House aide, Northeastern High School graduate Monica Goodling, admitted that she "crossed the line" in considering job applicants' loyalty to the Republican Party before approving their hires. Doing so is illegal. The Justice probe now is looking at hiring practices in at least three areas, including: ---Those by Goodling and other Justice officials. ---The Civil Rights Division. ---The department's honors programs and summer law intern positions. Critics say the honors program, which has long been filled with graduates from Ivy League and other prestigious law schools, has been opened to applicants with mostly political credentials. However, Justice officials say the program's applicants are all reviewed by an outside committee before they are hired by the deputy attorney general's office. The Civil Rights Division has seen the departure of dozens of career lawyers. The career personnel repeatedly clashed with Bush administration political appointees, who overruled them on pivotal voting-rights cases in Georgia and Texas. One former senior official in the division, Bradley Schlozman, replaced one of the fired U.S. attorneys -- Todd Graves of Kansas City, Mo. -- and attracted controversy by indicting four workers involved in a voter registration drive sponsored by a liberal group days before the November elections. Both Schlozman and Graves are scheduled to testify Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Fine and Jarrett could recommend internal disciplinary actions and have the power to refer cases for criminal prosecution. A final report will be made public, officials said. Justice officials said yesterday that a prosecutor at the center of the firings scandal, interim U.S. Attorney Tim Griffin of Little Rock, Ark., is leaving office effective today. Griffin, a former Republican National Committee researcher and aide to presidential adviser Karl Rove, replaced fired prosecutor Bud Cummins. Griffin withdrew his nomination for the job permanently amid uproar over his appointment. Meanwhile, Democrats Patrick Leahy of Vermont and John Conyers of Michigan, the chairs of the Senate and House panels, respectively, said the allegations show the need for greater oversight at the Justice Department. And Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., called anew for Gonzales to resign. "As long as Mr. Gonzales remains attorney general, no internal probe is going to clear the air," Schumer said. Last week, Monica Goodling began a full day of testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee with a prepared statement. The following portion addresses her role in hiring. "Fourth, I wish to clarify my role in career hiring at the Department. "During my five years at the Department, I believe I interviewed hundreds of job applicants. The vast majority of these were applicants for political appointee positions, but some were applicants for a few categories of career positions. Specifically, I interviewed candidates who were to be detailed into confidential, policy-making positions and Attorney General appointments, such as Immigration Judges and Members of the Board of Immigration Appeals. I also reviewed requests for waivers of hiring freezes imposed on districts with an outgoing U.S. Attorney or an Interim or Acting U.S. Attorney. "In every case, I tired to act in good faith and for the purpose of ensuring that the Department was staffed by well-qualified individuals who were supportive of the Attorney General's views, priorities, and goals. Nevertheless, I do acknowledge that I may have gone too far in asking political questions of applicants for career positions, and may have taken inappropriate political considerations into account on some occasions. I regret these mistakes."

They were identified as: &#8226; Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif. &#8226; Pfc. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami. &#8226; Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho. McFall and Cedeno Sanchez were killed in Baghdad on Monday, Memorial Day, when a bomb exploded nearby as they patrolled on foot, according to a Pentagon news release. Hester was killed two days earlier when a bomb detonated near his vehicle. The deaths bring to 19 the number of soldiers the post has lost in Iraq this month, more than in any other month since the invasion in March 2003. The May casualty total is now more than double Fort Lewis&#8217; previous worst month since the invasion: December 2004, when nine soldiers were killed. Fort Lewis has 10,000 soldiers in Iraq &#8211; likewise more than at any time in the war. Nearly all are deployed in two Stryker brigades in Baghdad and in Diyala province just to the northeast of the capital, scene of some of the deadliest insurgent attacks the past two months. Hester was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, which is part of the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division &#8211; a Stryker brigade that&#8217;s been in Iraq since last June. It&#8217;s expected to remain there into October. McFall and Cedeno Sanchez were assigned to the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, a part of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. It left Fort Lewis in April and arrived in Iraq early this month. The brigade has lost nine soldiers now in the first month of what is expected to be a 15-month deployment. Twenty-eight soldiers from the 3rd Brigade have been killed in nearly a year. McFall&#8217;s wife, Emily, in a statement through the post public affairs office, described her husband as &#8220;a proud dad, a great son and a friend to many.&#8221; He was renowned for his barbecued ribs and his fondness for classic rock and cold beer, she said. They had soldiers over often, especially at the holidays. &#8220;He would go into a bar, bathroom, store, anywhere, and someone would start talking to him like they knew him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He could always put a positive spin on anything. He made me and a lot of other people better just by knowing him. &#8220;He loved the brotherhood, and his heart beat red, white, and blue,&#8221; Emily McFall said. &#8220;There was only one exit for him.&#8221; A post spokesman said McFall joined the Army in 1994 and was assigned to Fort Bragg, N.C. He then spent a year in South Korea and was at Fort Lewis in the late 1990s before going to Hawaii and deploying to Afghanistan for a year in 2004-05. Cedeno Sanchez joined the Army in November 2005 and arrived at Fort Lewis the following June. Hester enlisted in May 2004 and arrived at Fort Lewis that September and deployed with the 3rd Brigade last June. Hester and Cedeno Sanchez were serving on their first combat tours. Two other soldiers suffered minor injuries in the attack that killed Hester, but they returned to duty, officials said. No memorial ceremony at Fort Lewis has been set for the three Stryker soldiers. Brig. Gen. William Troy, the acting post commander, last week wrote a memo saying that memorials now would be consolidated once a month, so presumably these three men will be memorialized together in late June.

"This is the first time we are accusing a blue-chip American company of profiting from torture," said ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner, who spoke about the case at a news conference in New York. Since at least 2001, , of San Jose, "has provided direct and substantial services to the United States for its so-called extraordinary rendition' program, enabling the clandestine and forcible transportation of suspects to secret overseas detention facilities where they are placed beyond the reach of the law and subjected to torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment," the suit alleges. A spokesman for Jeppesen said: "There isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for them." "Publicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standards," the suit states. Jeppesen provided flight and logistical support services to aircraft and crew used in the rendition program "to unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in , Egypt, and Afghanistan," adds the suit brought on behalf of three men. They are Binyam Mohammed, a British resident who was taken into custody in and is now being held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba; Abou Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and is currently being held in Morocco, and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian citizen, who while seeking asylum in was arrested by Swedish security police, handed over to CIA agents, shackled, drugged, and flown to Cairo from Stockholm, according to the suit. ACLU attorneys, including the organization's executive director, Anthony Romero, said they had obtained information about the rendition program from a variety of sources, including probes in Spain and Sweden and press reports, in particular an article by Jane Mayer in the New Yorker on October 30, portions of which were quoted in the lawsuit. Ms. Mayer wrote that a former Jeppesen employee told her that at a company board meeting a senior Jeppesen official stated: "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights  you know the torture flights. Let's face it, some of these flights end up that way." The case, filed under the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789, which enables foreigners to sue in U.S. courts for human-rights violations, is expected to be vigorously fought in court not only by Jeppesen but also by the CIA. The agency was not named as a defendant in the case, but it is possible that the agency will ask a federal judge for permission to intervene and seek to have the case dismissed under the "state-secrets" doctrine. Last March, a federal appeals court in Richmond, , dismissed a case filed by a German citizen who was subjected to extraordinary rendition. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the civil suit filed by Khaled El-Masri could not be reviewed in an American court because of the government's invocation of the "state-secrets" privilege.

The president used his most forceful language yet in support of the Senate bill, which would establish a new point system for awarding green cards and offer legal status to many illegal workers already in the country. "The first step to comprehensive reform must be to enforce immigration laws at the borders and at work sites across America. And this is what this bill does," Bush said at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco. "For the skeptics who say that we're not concerned about border security or workplace enforcement, they need to read the bill." Bush accused conservative opponents of the bill of engaging in "empty political rhetoric." "I know there are some people out there hollering and saying, 'Kick them out.' That is simply unrealistic. It won't work," the president said. "If you want to scare the American people, what you say is, the bill is an amnesty bill. It's not an amnesty bill. That's empty political rhetoric, trying to frighten our fellow citizens." Under the deal struck this month between the White House and a bipartisan group of senators, workers seeking legal status would need to pay fines and back taxes and eventually demonstrate proficiency in English. Border security also would need to be improved before other parts of the immigration package -- including a temporary worker program and legal status for some workers who are currently illegal -- can take effect. One reason Bush chose to speak to law enforcement trainees at this federal site about 60 miles south of Savannah was to underscore his commitment to improved border controls. The bill would increase the number of border agents to 20,000, add hundreds of miles of fencing and vehicle barriers, and build 105 more surveillance towers. "A lot of Americans are skeptical about immigration reform primarily because they don't think the government can fix the problems," Bush said. "And my answer to the skeptics is ... give us a chance to fix this problem. Don't try to kill this bill before it gets moving." White House officials declined to say whether the president has made progress in persuading members of his own party to support the deal. "I'm not going to get into nose counting right now," said White House spokesman Tony Snow. "We have been inviting folks to take a look. And I think the more they hear, the more they're going to be inclined to support it." The immigration package survived several legislative challenges last week, its first on the floor of the Senate. The administration and other supporters say they are optimistic that the bill will be passed in the Senate with its central compromise intact: legal status for many of those already in the country in return for shifting the emphasis in the future away from family unification toward a more merit-based system. The bill's fate in the House is less certain. Last year, a comprehensive immigration reform package squeaked past the Senate only to die in the House. This year, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, has said the White House needs to deliver 70 Republican votes or the bill will not make it to the president's desk. "I appreciate the Republicans and Democrats in the United States Senate ... who put politics aside and put courage first to work on a comprehensive bill," Bush said. "It takes a lot of courage in the face of some of the criticism in the political world to do what's right, not what's comfortable. And what's right is to fix this system now before it's too late."

Now, with Friday marking the start of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season that lasts through November, nerves are on edge across the region, with forecasters predicting more tropical storms than normal this season in warmer Atlantic waters. Psychologists helping people cope with lingering fears of displacement and chaos say some victims of monster storms show evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder. "No doubt about it, the word 'hurricane' is a bad word here. With all the recent hot and dry weather, everyone is tense that we're in for a hard season," said psychologist Pamula Mills, who helps relieve schoolchildren's storm stress for the Bahamian Ministry of Education. Forecasters also predicted a stronger-than-average hurricane season last year, but the weather was muted by El Nio, the tropical Pacific warming effect that can change wind patterns in the eastern Atlantic. The latest El Nio cycle is over and the climate phenomenon should not influence this hurricane season, said Bill Proenza, head of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Other conditions could develop that encourage more storms this year than last, he added. U.S. National Weather Service expects 13 to 17 tropical storms this year, with seven to 10 of them becoming hurricanes and three to five of them in the strong category. Hurricanes are among nature's most powerful natural events. Spinning as fast as a race car, sheer walls of wind and rain can rise 10 miles (16 kilometres) into the stratosphere and span 400 miles (640 kilometres), dwarfing most Caribbean island nations and territories.

(AP / Charles Dharapak) Bush calls for global emissions goals Updated Thu. May. 31 2007 11:45 AM ET -- U.S. President George Bush, seeking to blunt international criticism of the U.S. record on climate change, on Thursday urged 15 major nations to agree by the end of next year on a global emissions goal for reducing greenhouse gases. Bush called for the first in a series of meetings to begin this fall, bringing together countries identified as major emitters of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. The list would include the United States, China, India and major European countries. The president outlined his proposal in a speech ahead of next week's summit in Germany of leading industrialized nations, where global warming is to be a major topic and Bush will be on the spot. The United States has refused to ratify the landmark 1997 Kyoto Protocol requiring industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2012. Developing countries, including China and India, were exempted from that first round of cuts. Bush rejected the Kyoto approach, as well as the latest German proposal for what happens after 2012. "The United States takes this issue seriously," Bush said. "The new initiative I'm outlining today will contribute to the important dialogue that will take place in Germany next week." Along with his call for a global emissions goal, Bush urged other nations to eliminate tariffs on clean energy technologies. Germany, which holds the European Union and Group of Eight presidencies, is proposing a so-called "2-degree" target, whereby global temperatures would be allowed to increase no more than 2 degrees Celsius -- the equivalent of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit -- before being brought back down. Practically, experts have said that means a global reduction in emissions of 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Instead, Bush called for nations to hold a series of meetings, beginning this fall, to set a global emissions goal. Each nation then would have to decide on how to achieve the goal, White House officials said. "The United States will work with other nations to establish a new framework for greenhouse gas emissions for when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012," the president said. "So my proposal is this: By the end of next year, America and other nations will set a long-term global goal for reducing greenhouse gases. To develop this goal, the United States will convene a series of meetings of nations that produce the most greenhouse gasses, including nations with rapidly growing economies like India and China. "Each country would establish midterm management targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs," he said. "In the course of the next 18 months, our nations will bring together industry leaders from different sectors of our economies, such as power generation, and alternative fuels and transportation." Bush's critics were quick to respond, even before the president's speech had concluded. Daniel J. Weiss, climate strategy director for the liberal Center for American Progress, said the Bush administration has a "do-nothing" policy on global warming despite U.S. allies' best efforts to spur U.S. reductions. "Our allies' pleas for action add to the voices of many big corporations such as Dow, Shell, General Electric, and General Motors," Weiss said. "These and other Fortune 500 companies endorsed a 60 percent to 80 percent reduction in global warming pollution by 2050, the level scientists indicate that we must reach to stave off the worst impacts. Unfortunately, these appeals from his foreign and corporate allies continue to fall on President Bush's deaf ears." The U.S. last year actually experienced a drop in emissions of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas most blamed for global warming. The 1.3 percent decline from 2005, the first drop in 11 years, was due to a mild winter followed by a cool summer. Carbon dioxide is produced from burning fossil fuels, including natural gas and coal, which are used widely to produce electricity to heat homes in winter and run air conditioners in summer. While Bush announced his new proposal, the administration registered its opposition to a number of approaches to combat global warming. Specifically, the White House said it does not support a global carbon-trading program allowing countries to buy and sell carbon credits to meet limits on carbon dioxide levels. The White House also expressed opposition to energy efficiency targets advocated by the EU, arguing that a standard applicable in one country does not fit another.

The Senate adjourned in the early evening, and the House went until the midnight deadline with a last-ditch round of tense debate over water, border security and electric deregulation. The embattled Craddick finished the 140-day session as the man in charge of the House. He cocked his head back and laughed as he chatted with some Republican supporters in the House chamber toward the end of the day. Democrats and Republicans alike complain that Craddick has ruled with an iron fist. They say his win-at-all-cost style often forces them to vote against the interests of their own districts. Opponents tried all weekend to oust him from power, with no success. Craddick refused to allow the opposition bring up a motion for a vote to ``vacate the chair.'' Craddick is currently the longest-serving House member and the first Republican speaker since Reconstruction, having taken over in 2003 after the GOP won a majority of House seats. Frustrated by their failed attempts to overthrow Craddick, dozens of angry House members stormed out of the chamber in protest in the early morning hours Monday. ``This man is sitting here violating every rule of the House, every rule of parliamentary procedure to keep himself in office, and it's wrong,'' said Rep. Pat Haggerty, a Republican. A prepared statement from Craddick's office chided those it said were trying to divert the House from important matters and trying to drag lawmakers into a speaker's race. Despite some 11th-hour fights and threats in the Senate to filibuster the budget bill, the House and Senate signed off late Sunday night and early Monday on a compromise $153 billion two-year spending plan, the state's largest ever.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Sheehan 'Resigns' As Protest Leader By ANGELA K. BROWN Tuesday, May 29, 2007; 6:04 PM FORT WORTH, Texas -- Cindy Sheehan, the soldier's mother who galvanized an anti-war movement with her monthlong protest outside President Bush's ranch, said Tuesday she's done being the public face of the movement. "I've been wondering why I'm killing myself and wondering why the Democrats caved in to George Bush," Sheehan told The Associated Press while driving from her property in Crawford to the airport, where she planned to return to her native California. Peace activist Cindy Sheehan speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 3, 2007 where House Democrats were meeting. (Lauren Victoria Burke - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article "I'm going home for awhile to try and be normal," she said. In what she described as a "resignation letter," Sheehan wrote in her online diary on the Daily Kos blog: "Good-bye America ... you are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it. "It's up to you now." Sheehan began a grass roots peace movement in August 2005 when she camped outside Bush's Crawford ranch for 26 days, demanding to talk with the president about her son's death. Army Spc. Casey Sheehan was 24 when he was killed in an ambush in Baghdad in 2004. Cindy Sheehan's protest started small but swelled to thousands and quickly drew national attention. Over the next two years, she drew huge crowds as she spoke at protest events. But she also drew criticism for some actions, such as meeting with Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's leftist president. "I have endured a lot of smear and hatred since Casey was killed and especially since I became the so-called "Face" of the American anti-war movement," Sheehan wrote in the diary. Kristinn Taylor, spokesman for FreeRepublic.com, which has held pro-troop rallies and counter-protests of anti-war demonstrations, said dwindling crowds at Sheehan's Crawford protests since her initial vigil may have led to her decision. But he also said he hopes she will now be able to heal. "Her politics have hurt a lot of people, including the troops and their families, but most of us who support the war on terror understand she is hurt very deeply," Taylor said Tuesday. "Those she got involved with in the anti-war movement realize it was to their benefit to keep her in that stage of anger." When Sheehan first took on Bush, she was a darling of the liberal left. "However, when I started to hold the Democratic Party to the same standards that I held the Republican Party, support for my cause started to erode and the 'left' started labeling me with the same slurs that the right used," she wrote in the diary. She said she sacrificed a 29-year marriage and endured threats to put all her energy into stopping the war. What she found, she wrote, was a movement "that often puts personal egos above peace and human life."

Thompson Says He'll Run For U.S. President 2007-05-31 01:43:38 (11 hours ago) (Read 72 times || 0 comments) Hollywood actor Fred Thompson said in an interview that he plans to run for U.S. president in 2008, joining a crowded field of Republican candidates. "I can't remember exactly the point I said, 'I'm going to do this,"' Thompson said of his planned presidential run in Thursday's edition of USA Today. "But when I did, the thing that occurred to me: 'I'm going to tell people that I am thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it."' Thompson, a 64-year-old social conservative, said he was planning a campaign that will use blogs, video posts and other Internet innovations to reach voters turned off by "politics-as-usual" in both parties, USA Today said.

On Wednesday, a long-time friend and political adviser said Thompson had tentatively decided to run for president and that he has quit his role on the TV crime series "Law & Order." "His mind is made up to run if interest continues to be as intense as it is," Tom Ingram said in a telephone interview. Thompson, who won election twice as a Republican senator from Tennessee, will now begin raising money to gauge support, added Ingram, who serves as chief of staff to Sen. Lamar Alexander, also a Tennessee Republican. Late on Wednesday, "Law & Order" creator Dick Wolf said Thompson had asked to leave the show where he has played New York District Attorney Arthur Branch for five seasons. "I've spoken to Fred today, and although he told me he has not made a firm decision about his political future, he felt that given the creative and scheduling constraints of the upcoming season, he asked to be released from his responsibilities to the show," Wolf said in a statement. Thompson joins a crowded Republican field with no dominant choice. President George W. Bush, prohibited from running for a third term in November 2008, is set to leave office in January 2009. The current front-runners include former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Sen. John McCain, of Arizona, and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Ingram said Thompson held a conference call with fund-raisers on Tuesday and it was decided that he would "test the waters" by setting up a preliminary committee. Ten men are already running for the Republican nomination and former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia also is weighing a campaign. Thompson was first elected to the Senate in 1994 to fill Democrat Al Gore's seat when he became vice president. He maintained a solid conservative voting record. Besides having been a U.S. senator and working as an actor, Mr. Thompson was also worked as an attorney for the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee during its impeachment hearings of former President Richard Nixon.

In between, the House and Senate managed to pass some meaningful legislation, but few legislators, particularly Craddick, will remember this tumultuous and tendentious session as memorable for its accomplishments. Craddick is a survivor, but being the longest serving member in the House and the first Republican House speaker since Reconstruction has not taught the Midland legislator much about using the levers of power in the service of a great vision for the people of Texas. Instead, Craddick has used the power of the post to punish political opponents, reward sycophants and force anyone else who doesn't get in step with his conservative agenda to knuckle under. Now the fight to remove him from what is considered to be one of the three most powerful offices in state government moves to the 2008 elections in which those who have openly declared their opposition now may face challengers funded by Craddick supporters. It is likely that the fight over who controls the House gavel is only being postponed until the 2009 session. This session, however, wasn't all political brawls. Texas legislators did move the state forward by restoring the false savings in the Children's Health Insurance Program that had been made by the 2003 session. Likewise, Texas state parks, whose treatment under state budgets has been all but shameful, will get new money as a cap on the sporting goods tax was loosened. The cause of open government was advanced with the passage of a constitutional proposal, to be on the November ballot that would record individual legislators' votes on final passage of bills. And the session dealt decisively with a sex scandal at the Texas Youth Commission. As in any Texas legislative session, some measures failed that merited passing, such as a statewide smoking ban in public places, and a shield law for Texas journalists. Some measures passed to the detriment of open government, such as allowing the sealing of some search warrants and making private the names of holders of concealed weapons permits. Some measures fully merited their demise, such as yet another school voucher program and requiring photo IDs for voters at the polls. Left simmering at the end of this session was highway funding. When state legislators return in 2009, they will have to face the question of whether to raise the gasoline tax or find alternative funding for the state's massive transportation needs. And left on a rolling boil was the question of Crad-dick's leadership. He clearly deserves to go, but a creaky system that favors incumbents through open balloting and the power of the budget serves to keep him as speaker of a rebellious House. PASSED, AWAITING GOVERNOR ACTION Sets out a $153 billion two-year spending plan for the state covering major programs such as K-12 education, public universities, health and human services, state parks and criminal justice. Establishes mandatory random steroid testing for Texas public high school athletes in all sports as early as the 2007 football season.

The vaccine protects against strains of the sexually transmitted virus that cause most cases of cervical cancer.

Would have allowed private schools into the Texas public school athletic league. Would have required motorists to give bicyclists at least three feet of space when passing. Would have allowed couples applying for a marriage license or couples already married to designate theirs a âcovenant marriage,â making divorce more difficult.

A proposed constitutional amendment requiring the Texas House and Senate to record individual lawmakersâ votes on final passage of bills. Posted by stff on May 30, 2007 at 9:55 a.m. ( Thank goodness the "Shield Law' for Texas journalist s failed! The last thing the partisian press needs in this state and this country is extra protection over and above what they already have in the Constitution. They would hide behind this to allow their interests (the Democrat party and liberal special interests) to go after the Republicans and Conservatives. Unitl the partsian press shows reponsiblity and reports news instead of trying to make news or be a cheerleader for agendas, they don't deserve special protection. When the editors of this paper (who probably don't read this stuff) start looking out for ther rights granted in the Constitution to us the "little people" out here like our rights to excerise of freedoms to worship, right to bare arms and most importanly own private property without it being regulated or taken over without due compenstation, then maybe they will get more support for their concerns.

Almost two years ago, he screamed at President Bush telling him to get off his butt. Now, ensconced in the safe confines of D-Day museum, his cry was less shrill, less urgent but still pleading for the federal government and the Governor to get off of their collective tushes and help. Weeks after Katrina, Bush told us that he would do whatever it takes to bring back He has not done so. Instead, he has separated wind from flood. He has set up a housing program and a recovery that needs a recovery. Without doubt, the rebuild has been slow and so very painful. According to Nagin on Wednesday, &ldquo;total deaths are up 47%. Suicide prevention calls are nine times pre-katrina levels.&rdquo; Money is still plugged waiting to trickle down, not flow. That would be asking too much of the state and the Bush Administration. must be the beggar, asking for what it considers to be its fair share. has come back, some. When I first returned in late September right after the storms, all that existed was dust, a smell that would kill, little potable water, the military with jeeps and plenty of migrant workers. I looked around and so no social life and wondered if there was any signs of Buildings that were still standing were de-roofed and destruction was everywhere. And, as Nagin said, there was &ldquo;no game plan&rdquo;, no road map, no dots to follow. During this recovery, Nagin has made a number of missteps. His statements have been divisive on occasions and have angered me tremendously but he has always been a beacon of hope when others would have simply thrown in the towel and some actually have done so. The fact is that Our Moody&rsquo;s bond rating has gone from &ldquo;junk&rdquo; to &ldquo;stable&rdquo;. Retailers are beginning to make some money depending upon the seasons. Homes are starting to be rebuilt but many just sit waiting for buyers and insurers. Nagin is not, nor has he ever been the most articulate speaker. He has talked optimistically yet sometimes very openly voicing his mind, often failing to choose his words more wisely. But, while Mayor Nagin was the man at the podium on Wednesday, the City of and the region really is not about him. It is about every day people desperately trying to hang on for survival, looking with trepidation at another hurricane season, seeing their families fractured and hoping that big business understands the Jewel of America needs plenty of shine, big ideas and yes, money. When we look back through the prism of history, we will realize that had the least amount of stroke in the trilogy of state, federal and local government. We will see a man who failed to inspire some, but persevered and did try despite the incredible odds against him. We will see a man who has been vilified, has kissed the extremes and for the most part, been a good steward through a horrible time. Moses did not see the after begging Pharaoh to let his people go. With three years in his administration, Nagin will not see the after begging the state and the feds for help, which has come, but not as promised. is a beautiful place with so much hope. It cannot be the city it was with crime, social needs and poor schools--but it can be the city it should be. Nagin can lead the way, but his administration needs more help from the public sector, from insurance companies who refuse to take risks and from the private industry captains who can see a miracle on and want to be part of a rebirth. Nagin&rsquo;s speech was fitting being held at the D-Day museum. So often, so many of us have felt as if every day is the day of decision. plan after World War II because the federal government was afraid of more destruction and of communism. has received billions to rebuild and let us hope it uses our money wisely. has received some federal aid, it has, and still gets a pittance here and a few coins there from the state and the federal government. While Nagin spoke much about what was on his mind Wednesday night, he also held back. There was no yelling to get off the tail. Instead, he spoke of a tale of two cities: One in despair and one hopeful. Let&rsquo;s hope like the dickens the latter prevails.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) NEW ORLEANS -- Mayor Ray Nagin, in his first State of the City address since Hurricane Katrina, said Wednesday that New Orleans is a city on the mend, despite broken promises from the state and federal governments. "New Orleans is coming back, whether you like it or not," Nagin said to applause from the crowd of city workers and community members gathered at the National World War II Museum. "And you might as well deal with it." Nagin called on President Bush and Gov. Kathleen Blanco to do more to help speed the city's recovery from the August 2005 storm. He said Bush has failed to move federal aid to "the people who need it the most," and said he should forgive millions of dollars in disaster loans that the city took out after the storm to help it to continue operating. He also called on Blanco to use a budget surplus to help the city. "Use the $3 billion budget surplus to ensure a strong future for our state and for all our citizens," Nagin said. "Because as New Orleans recovers, and as south Louisiana recovers, so does Louisiana." A message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for Blanco. A White House spokeswoman said the city, not the federal government, must be the force behind the recovery effort. "The federal government has committed more than $110 billion to help the Gulf Coast recover, and we will continue to provide assistance. But the people of the Gulf Coast and their elected leaders must drive the effort to rebuild their lives and their communities," said Jeanie Mamo, a spokeswoman for the White House. Nagin referred to the city's challenges, including a storm-depleted police force dealing with a rise in violent crime and a health care system in "crisis," but he also touted what he deemed successes, from the cleanup of the French Quarter to the return of more than half the city's pre-Katrina population of 455,000. He compared his city to a patient written off as dying who eventually recovered. "We have stabilized. We are implementing plans for our future, and we are strong enough for the next phase of recovery -the transformation to the new New Orleans," Nagin said. The speech comes just two days before the start of a new hurricane season, and against the backdrop of a city still fighting to recover from a storm 21 months ago. Swaths of some neighborhoods remain in shambles, with houses empty and many small businesses ailing or shuttered. Police still work out of trailers. As of mid-month, the city said it had received just $163 million in federal rebuilding aid, a fraction of the $1 billion or more it says it will need just to restore what Katrina damaged and with little earmarked for permanent infrastructure work. Nagin asked residents - those in the city and still displaced - to not lose heart. He said he, too, has dealt with feelings of frustration and despair and with rebuilding challenges such as a new roof leaking that very morning. "Don't give up. Don't give up on us," he said against cheers and applause. "We will be back. The city of New Orleans will be back."

Actor Thompson set to enter White House race Thursday May 31, 2007 Fred Thompson is set to join the pool of US presidential hopefuls. Photograph: Douglas Healey/AP Hollywood actor Fred Thompson, who has been tantalising his Republican supporters, today all but declared his intention to run for the White House. In an interview with USA Today, the 64-year-old politician-turned-actor said he had already made his mind up and would test the waters in the coming weeks. "I can't remember exactly the point I said, 'I'm going to do this'. But when I did, the thing that occurred to me [was], 'I'm going to tell people that I am thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it'." Mr Thompson, whose folksy persona has won him comparisons with Ronald Reagan - still revered by Republicans, would join a crowded Republican field where no candidate has truly won the enthusiasm from the grassroots. The former New York city mayor, Rudy Giuliani, remains the frontrunner in a field of 10 candidates with 25% support, according to the pollsters Rasmussen, followed by Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts at 16% and senator John McCain at 15%. Even though he is not an official candidate, Mr Thompson, a former senator from Tennessee but now a star in the TV series Law and Order, gets a credible 12%. Mr Thompson, who will seek to present himself as a "true" conservative, told USA Today that he would run as an outsider, using as model his Senate campaign in 1994. After an unimpressive start, Mr Thompson ditched the tailored suit for a plaid shirt and jeans and began driving a red Chevy pickup across the state to snare the seat vacated by Al Gore, Bill Clinton's vice-president. Despite his background as a Washington lawyer and lobbyist, Mr Thompson attacked Congress as out of touch with constituents. Mr Thompson, who once said life in Washington made him "long for the sincerity and realism of Hollywood", announced he would not seek re-election to the Senate in 2002 because he "simply did not have the heart for another six-year term". But Mr Thompson, apparently politically re-invigorated, said he was planning a campaign that would use blogs, video posts and other internet techniques to reach voters turned off by "politics-as-usual". Despite his popular appeal, Mr Thompson has a lot of catching up to do, as his rivals have already been hard at work raising money and most political operatives are already in the employ of the current crop of candidates. His critics also cite his undistinguished Senate record, where he earned a reputation for being less than hard-working. Mr Thompson is expected to make his first formal campaign move in the next few days, establishing an official organisation to size up a White House campaign while launching a major fundraising drive. He may visit early primary states in late June and could officially enter the race as early as the first week in July. A social conservative, Mr Thompson voted in favour of oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, eliminating money for the National Endowment for the Arts and a constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration. Against gun control, he voted against requiring criminal background checks for purchases at gun shows. On Iraq, Mr Thompson voted to authorise the invasion in October 2002 and now opposes setting a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops. Mr Thompson first came into the public eye as Republican counsel to the Watergate committee. He was a senator for eight years before his retirement in 2002.

Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Wed, May. 30, 2007 Bush Confronts Immigration Deal Skeptics President Bush is introduced prior to an address on immigration reform, Tuesday, May 29, 2007, at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak) GLYNCO, Ga. - President Bush attacked opponents of an immigration deal Tuesday, suggesting they "don't want to do what's right for America." "The fundamental question is, will elected officials have the courage necessary to put a comprehensive immigration plan in place," Bush said against a backdrop of a huge American flag. He described his proposal , which has been agreed to by a bipartisan group of senators , as one that "makes it more likely we can enforce our border , and at the same time uphold the great immigrant tradition of the United States of America." Bush spoke at the nation's largest training center for law enforcement. He chose the get-tough setting as conservative critics blast a Senate proposal as being soft on people who break the law. Hoping to blunt that message, Bush emphasized that any new options for immigrants and foreign workers would not start until tougher security is in place. The presidential stop came during a congressional recess, with senators back home and facing pressure from the left and right on the immigration plan. Bush's aim is to build momentum for the legislation, perhaps his best chance for a signature victory in his second term. The Senate expects to resume debate on it next week. "A lot of Americans are skeptical about immigration reform, primarily because they don't think the government can fix the problems," Bush said. "And my answer to the skeptics is: give us a chance to fix the problems in a comprehensive way that enforces our border and treats people with decency and respect. Give us a chance to fix this problem. Don't try to kill this bill before it gets moving," Bush told students and instructors at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Bush repeatedly cast the matter as one of political courage. "Those determined to find fault with this bill will always be able to look at a narrow slice of it and find something they don't like," the president said. "If you want to kill the bill, if you don't want to do what's right for America, you can pick one little aspect out of it. "You can use it to frighten people," Bush said. "Or you can show leadership and solve this problem once and for all." The bill would give temporary legal status to millions of unlawful immigrants, provided they came forward, paid a fine and underwent criminal background checks. To apply for a green card, they would have to pay another fine, learn English, return to their home country and wait in line. The plan also would create a guest worker program. It would allow foreign laborers to come to the U.S. for temporary stints, yet with no guarantee they can eventually gain citizenship. Both the new visa plan and the temporary worker program are contingent on other steps coming first. Those include fencing and barriers along the Mexico border, the hiring of more Border Patrol agents and the completion of an identification system to verify employees' legal status. The legislation would also reshape future immigration decisions. A new point system would prioritize skills and education over family in deciding who can immigrate. Georgia's senators both played leading roles in producing Bush's deal with the Senate. Yet they have also said they may not support the final bill, depending upon how it is amended. Bush chastised those who say the proposal offers amnesty to illegal immigrants. He called it empty political rhetoric.

Security Council voted Wednesday to establish an international tribunal to prosecute suspects in the killing of Lebanon's former prime minister, Rafik Hariri, prompting many Lebanese to celebrate and dance in the streets. The vote was 10-0 with five abstentions: Russia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar. A suicide truck bomb in Beirut killed Hariri and 22 others in February 2005. The first U.N. chief investigator said the attack's complexity suggested that Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services played a role. Four Lebanese generals have been under arrest for 20 months, accused of involvement. Syria has denied any involvement. -- The Associated Press About the Real Cities Network About the McClatchy Company Terms of Use & Privacy Statement

The loudest jeers were reserved for Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, the amendment&#8217;s most prominent opponent, and seven black or Hispanic council members who abstained from voting. But while the outcome was widely expected, the high-decibel meeting, preceded by a rally on the steps of City Hall, was a stark contrast to the normally subdued process the Council goes through once or twice a year in choosing people to honor with street names. It was also one the most divisive issues to confront Ms. Quinn, the council&#8217;s first openly gay speaker and an ardent supporter of civil rights causes, in her year and half as speaker. At one point, Councilman Charles Barron, a Brooklyn Democrat and a former Black Panther, refused to stop talking after his two-minute comment period. Wagging a finger in Ms. Quinn&#8217;s direction, Mr. Barron said, &#8220;You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever did.&#8221; For her part, Ms. Quinn said of Mr. Carson, &#8220;He was not an individual who sought to bring our city together.&#8221; Mr. Carson, who died in 2002, was an ex-convict who became a community advocate and antidrug crusader. Some saw him as a community leader, but others saw him as a thug and a bigot. Once asked about charges of being anti-Semitic, he said: &#8220;That&#8217;s absolutely absurd, &#8216;anti-Semitic.&#8217; And so you don&#8217;t ask the question, I&#8217;m antiwhite. Don&#8217;t limit my antis to just one group of people.&#8221; He was convicted in 1974 of kidnapping in a case prosecutors described as a vigilante-style attack that left one person dead and another near death. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. He re-emerged in the 1980s to crusade against drugs and police brutality. &#8220;Sonny Carson got more crack houses closed than the entire Police Department,&#8221; Mr. Barron said during the premeeting rally. In 1990, Mr. Carson led a boycott of Korean-owned delis in black neighborhoods, carrying picket signs that said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shop with people who don&#8217;t look like us.&#8221; Michael C. Nelson, chairman of the Council&#8217;s Jewish Caucus, recalled the time when Mr. Carson first received national attention as a militant protester during the struggle for community control of public schools. &#8220;Thirty-seven years ago, Sonny Carson walked into my wife&#8217;s classroom and said he didn&#8217;t want any white Jews teaching his children, and he also said he would carve his initials on her chest if she didn&#8217;t leave,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am voting no.&#8221; has said of Mr. Carson that there is probably no one who less deserves a street named after him. Councilman Albert Vann, a Brooklyn Democrat who introduced the amendment, said that whether you agreed or disagreed with Mr. Carson&#8217;s tactics, the community should have the right to decide whom to name streets after. Community Board 3 of Brooklyn had voted in favor of renaming four blocks of Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant to Sonny Abubadika Carson Avenue. Community Board support is required to rename a street, for which Council approval is usually little more than a formality. There were 51 names on the Council&#8217;s list this year, including the actor Jerry Orbach and the modern dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.

Fill out this form to email this article to a friend Fees to become a U.S. citizen, resident, to increase sharply Published May 30, 2007 WASHINGTON - Immigration officials said Tuesday they will proceed with plans to double the cost of applying to become a U.S. citizen and triple the fee for seeking legal permanent residency. The fee increases will take effect July 30. Citizenship fees will rise from $330 to $595, plus $80 for required electronic fingerprints, an increase of $10. For legal permanent residency and fingerprints the cost will be $1, 010 for those older than 14. The cost now is $325. Officials with Citizenship and Immigration Services, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, said the increases are needed to improve service, hire 1, 500 workers, improve offices, equipment and systems to process applications. Many immigration groups and some Democratic members of Congress have protested the fee increases, saying they will put citizenship and legal immigration out of reach of many immigrants. They also question whether better service will follow. The new fees were to be published this week in the Federal Register and also were posted on the Citizenship and Immigration Services Web site.

Comments on this article Obviously some people here forget that the USA was built on immigrants. Where would you be without your ancestors coming from all over the world? Only because you were born as an American, doesn't give you the right to talk bad about every immigrant! I am going through a hard legal immigrant process- its been ~10 years and waiting. I have spent almost $15,000 (incl. lawyers) per person in my family and still no sight of GREEN CARD!! DO YOU THINK ANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WILL PAY THIS MUCH? AND MORE? Well, hopefully we will get what we pay for then, rather then the crappy waiting list. And also if this is such a case then people, people w/ permanent residency should not be paying for someelse's grandma and grandpa in day care? Citizen=Taxes..etc Most of those families make less than 11,000 a year; those immigrants are exploited in their own countries, why shouldn't we take advantage of those people with no country? We forgot that millions came illegally from Europe, but 99% became citizens. Born in US-in luv w/an Israeli national-Got married& started the process we've pyd over $10K in fees& lawyers& we're only about 1/2 way done. I've nvr been treated w/such disrespect & prejudice 'til dealing w/ INS-They are evil! FREE RIDE?-YEAH RT! I have studied here for 2 years and worked here for 8 years. All legally. I am still waiting for my green card. The fee is not an issue for me. But the process time is really bad. I have no idea what INS is doing every day. If they wanna be citizens, let them pay the price. The fees should be at least another 30% higher. Afterall, countries around the world charge Americans the eqivalent of an expensive steak dinner, about $40. just to depart their countries. Screw 'em Now the illegals will pay for some of the other illegals. Win-win. I pay more for the illegals free health care each month, Some of you are in states where it DOES NOT affect you. I am in Phoenix, one of the worst, and living in fear because of the illegals on the street is NO way to live. Having to be on edge all the time and fear for your families safety is not right. I agree with Alan, I did it the 'legal' way and it cost over $11k, and I'm still not a citizen, and the wall around Berlin worked I'm sure the one in the USA will too. This is the main reason when we go oversees, that people doesn't like us, comments like the ones made here are a shame for our nation It's too late, and too little. . . I don't believe in free rides. I think the amounts are very fair considering we have been paying through the nose for these outlaws. I think that if any illegals are caught refusing to pay the price...fine them the same amount and send them back...after they pay the fine. Allen & JT how about you work for 5 years, pay taxes and SS that don't benefit you, and have no right to vote on these issues. I think Immigrants pay plenty already. It cost me close to $13,000 just to be legal resident. Good move. Immigration Services should collect enough in fees to fully support its expenses. Some moron will always roll out the "illegals" stuff. People don't come to this country and just take, you idiot. By the way, no one is "jumping to the front of the line," either, as there is often no line for anyone to get into, $ or not. It costs a hell of a lot more than just the fees listed here to become a citizen - this is just the final fee. If you think all it takes for an immigrant to become a citizen is $400, then you really should educate yourself better. I'm an immigrant who came to this country the hard way - legally. I guarantee that this fee hike will not improve service. The INS is the nastiest and most incompetent bunch of bureaucrats on the face of the earth. Dealing with them is a nightmare. IF the bush administration had been at plymouth rock this country would still be only 13 colonies and white only! Well, it is about time. If you really want to become an American it should not be a free ride for just everyone at $400.00. $1000.00 seems pretty reasonable to me. If you want to hear the music, you have to pay the piper. Being an American is more expensive(primarily taxes to support illegal aliens) so becoming a citizen should be more expensive to prove you can afford to contribute not just take. If you can't afford $675 to become a citizen how will you benefit USA? Between the fees charged at origin to enter green card lotteries, the amount required to support oneself upon entry and now the increased citizen and residency fees here, it would be easier to enter illegally, or at least a lot cheaper. It's logical. This administration is only about more money. That's why we're in Iraq, for example, although that went a bit wrong. Subscribe to the Times of the St. Petersburg Times.

Mr. Bush spoke Tuesday at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in the southern U.S. state of Georgia. He said the proposed bill, which has been agreed on by the White House and a bipartisan group of senators, is the best hope for lasting reform. The Senate will resume debate on the bill after a holiday recess. President Bush emphasized that any new options for immigrants and foreign workers will not begin until tougher border security is in place. He also rejected claims that the proposal offers amnesty to illegal immigrants, calling the accusations "empty political rhetoric." Under the bill, immigrants would be given temporary legal status, provided they come forward, pay a fine and undergo a criminal background check. The bill also would create a guest worker program that would allow foreign laborers to come to the United States for temporary stays. Some critics of the bill say it rewards criminal behavior by granting amnesty to illegal immigrants. Other critics say the bill is too hard on immigrants, because it would make them return to their home country and wait in line to apply for a green card for permanent resident status. Last week, lawmakers in the Senate rejected a handful of amendments to the immigration deal, including eliminating a provision that offers legal status to most of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Some information for this report was provided by AP.

One decision for his defense attorneys will be whether to acknowledge that the 71-year-old former crop-duster was a Klansman or to make the prosecution prove it. Seale was indicted in January and has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and conspiracy charges in the May 2, 1964, abduction, beating and slaying of two black 19-year-olds, Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore, in rural southwest Mississippi. Jury selection is scheduled to start Wednesday at the federal courthouse in Jackson, although there&#39;s a chance it will be delayed because U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate is presiding over another trial that was still going Tuesday. Attorneys anticipate jury selection in the Seale case could take one to four days. More than 300 potential jurors have been called from 45 counties in the southern half of Mississippi, and they were sent detailed questionnaires designed to reveal their attitudes about race. Among other things, they were asked whether they or their relatives have ever belonged to the Klan. During a hearing in April, assistant public defender Kathy Nester said she worried that the questionnaire - similar to those used in other revived civil rights-era across the South in the past several years - could prompt potential jurors to read or watch pretrial news coverage of the case and develop opinions about guilt or innocence. "I haven&#39;t checked recently, but I think we&#39;re the only Klan thing on the docket," Nester said. In another revived civil rights-era case, the state of Mississippi brought its first murder charges against one-time Klan leader Edgar Ray Killen two years ago. A Neshoba County jury convicted Killen on three counts of manslaughter on June 21, 2005 - 41 years to the day after civil-rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman were killed by a mob of Klansmen in what became known as the "Mississippi Burning" case. One of Killen&#39;s defense attorneys, Mitch Moran of Carthage acknowledged during opening arguments that their client had been involved in the Klan. "The Klan&#39;s not on trial here. Being a member of the Klan is not on trial here," Moran told the Neshoba County jury. In an interview with The Associated Press this past week, Moran said he has been talking with Seale&#39;s defense attorneys about trial strategies. "You&#39;ve got to try to desensitize the jury about the Ku Klux Klan," Moran told AP. "As far as defending a case, if the other side can prove it, you need to admit it." Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, who helped prosecute the Killen case, said dealing with any case that&#39;s decades old presents challenges that might not arise in newer cases. Evidence could be lost. Memories could fade. Hood said prosecutors need to remind jurors about the victims. "Right is right and wrong is wrong," Hood said. "You just have to make it personal to a lot of people." Prosecutors in the Seale trial say Dee and Moore were hitchhiking along U.S. 84 near Meadville when Seale picked them up and, followed by other Klansmen in another vehicle, took them to the nearby Homochitto National Forest. Court documents say the young men were beaten with switches and branches while Seale aimed a sawed-off shotgun at them, then they were stuffed into a trunk alive, driven across a state line into parts of Louisiana and dumped into the Mississippi River off Parker&#39;s Landing in Warren County, Miss. - an island owned by one of the conspirators, roughly 75 miles north of where the young men where picked up. An informant told the FBI that Moore was tied to a Jeep engine block, Dee was tied to some old railroad tracks and wheels, and the young men, still breathing, were dumped into the river to drown. The decomposing bodies of Dee and Moore were dragged from the river in July 1964 during authorities&#39; massive manhunt for Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman. Seale and reputed KKK member Charles Marcus Edwards were arrested in 1964 in the deaths of Dee and Moore. But the FBI was consumed by the Mississippi Burning investigation, and the southwest Mississippi case was turned the case over to local authorities, who promptly threw out all charges against Seale and Edwards. The Justice Department in 2000 reopened an investigation of the Dee and Moore slayings. The FBI has said the case was closed in 2003 and opened again in 2005. Edwards has been granted immunity and is expected to testify for the prosecution. Federal prosecutor Paige Fitzgerald has said the case had stalled over the years because many witness were afraid to come forward because of the Klan&#39;s "reign of terror," and that offering Edwards immunity and persuading him to testify was key to reviving the case.

The six-month Atlantic season starts Friday, and forecasters have predicted an above-average year: 13 to 17 named storms, with seven to 10 of them becoming hurricanes and three to five of those major one of at least Category 3 strength. One forecaster said odds were high that a major hurricane would hit the U.S. this year. Nevertheless, 53 percent of people surveyed in 18 Atlantic and Gulf Coast states say they don't feel that they are vulnerable to a hurricane, or to related tornadoes and flooding, according to the Mason-Dixon poll. Eighty-eight percent said they had not taken any steps to fortify their homes. Only 16 percent said they would defy orders to evacuate and try to ride out a hurricane in their homes. Public safety officials tell residents to stockpile at least a three-day supply of bottled water, nonperishable food and medicine. But 61 percent of poll respondents had no hurricane survival kit. Of those who did, 82 percent packed a fire hazard - candles or kerosene lamps. Missing from most of those kits were axes, which emergency officials recommended after many residents were trapped in their attics as they tried to escape the flooding following Hurricane Katrina. Despite the predictions for a busy 2007 season, public safety officials worry that an uneventful 2006 lulled residents into complacency; there were only 10 named storms, and the two that hit the U.S. were weak. Researcher William Gray, based at Colorado State University, said Thursday he saw a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane hitting the U.S. coast this year. His updated forecast still predicts 17 named storms and nine hurricanes, five of them intense. There is a 50 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the East Coast, including the Florida Peninsula, according to the new forecast; the long-term average is 31 percent. The chance of a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast between the Florida Panhandle and Brownsville, Texas, is 49 percent; the long-term average is 30 percent. There is also an above-average chance of a major hurricane making landfall in the Caribbean, according to the forecast, Gray said. The 2005 season set a record with 28 named storms, 15 of them hurricanes; four of those hurricanes hit the U.S. coast, including the devastating Katrina. In 2004, there were 15 named storms, four of them hurricanes that struck Florida. The poll showed that most residents still don't fully understand the risks posed by hurricanes: - 78 percent did not know that storm surge posed the greatest potential for a large loss of life, and can cause deaths as far as 20 miles inland. Also, a quarter did not know that standard homeowners insurance policies do not cover flooding. - 54 percent believed tornadoes only occur within three miles of a hurricane's eye. A hurricane can spawn tornadoes hundreds of miles from its eye. - 79 percent did not know that storm intensity is the hardest part of a storm to predict, so they may not understand that a Category 1 storm can strengthen to a major hurricane by landfall. The poll was commissioned by the organizers of the 2007 National Hurricane Survival Initiative. The group includes the National Hurricane Center, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Emergency Management Association, the Salvation Army and others. The initiative includes public service announcements and a 30-minute television program aimed at cable affiliates from Texas to Maine. Storm preparedness tips are posted on its Web site.

Lake Okeechobee hits record low fire in dry bed still burns (Last updated: 10:35 AM) MIAMI (AP) - Lake Okeechobee's water levels dropped to a record low today, the result of months of lower-than-normal rainfall levels that have afflicted the main backup water supply for 5 million South Florida residents. Plus a fire in a northwest dry riverbed is still burning. The incendiary fire started Monday in Buckhead Ridge in Glades County, but is not under control. It is sending smoke westward and has covered parts of Charlotte County. The South Florida Water Management District reported a record low of 8.94 feet, surpassing the mark of 8.97 feet set during a 2001 drought and tied Wednesday. The region's drought is leading water managers to assess how to best protect drinking water supplies, meet needs of the important agriculture industry and protect natural resources. The average water level should be around 13 feet this time of year in the second-largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. "There is no joy over this record-breaking event," said Carol Ann Wehle, the district's executive director. Record keeping on the lake's levels began in 1931. Lake Okeechobee is also the liquid heart of the Everglades. South Florida is largely dependent on the 730-square-mile lake during dry periods, when it can be used as a reservoir if water wells from underground aquifers get too low. Rainfall directly over the lake has been low enough to qualify this drought as a one-in-100-year event, the district said. Just 40 inches of rain have fallen on the region in the past 18 months, about half the average amount, water managers said. There is some possibility of rain this afternoon coming in from the Gulf of Mexico and chances of rain rise as the week goes on. The rain chance is 70 percent on Saturday, experts said. The area around the lake could get up to 1 1/2 inches of rain in the next two or three days, the National Weather Service in Miami said. The dry conditions have exposed vegetation that normally sits on the lake bottom. A 23-square-mile 15,000 acre fire started Monday in the dried-out vegetation in the lake's northwest rim. The fire was 75 percent contained today, and a voluntary evacuation for a mobile home park was called off. The fire in Babcock Ranch has broken 7,000 acres and is still 90 percent contained as it has been all week. That lightning fire is off State Road 31 behind Fire Station #9. There are no structures in danger, the Division of Forestry reported. The drought has forced stringent water restrictions on homes and businesses in 13 counties, and four coastal wells were closed to prevent saltwater contamination.

James Seale, 71, denies killing Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee. The former sheriff's deputy was first arrested in 1964. The authorities later freed him, citing lack of evidence. The case was reopened after a campaign by Mr Moore's brother, who had discovered that Mr Seale was still alive. He was rearrested in January. The trial in Jackson, Mississippi, began on Wednesday with jury selection. Mr Seale is charged with two counts of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping. Prosecutors said that in May 1964 Mr Seale aimed a shotgun at the two black men while fellow Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members beat them with tree branches. According to the indictment, Mr Seale and the others attached weights to the two men, took them out on the water in a boat and threw them into the river. Mr Seale was first arrested over the killings in 1964 Their bodies were discovered two months later by the FBI during a search for three missing civil rights workers. Mr Seale and a second man were arrested at the time. Consumed by the civil rights case, the FBI turned the case over to the local authorities, which threw out all charges because they claimed there was not enough evidence. If convicted, Mr Seale will face a maximum term of life imprisonment on each count of the indictment. For years, Mr Seale's family told reporters that he had died. In 2005, Thomas Moore alerted the authorities to the fact that Mr Seale was living a few miles from where the kidnappings took place. The FBI is currently re-opening several cases from the civil rights era before suspects die. During the movement of the 1950s and 1960s, dozens of black people were killed by white people who wanted to retain racial segregation. Few of the crimes were solved, partly because some of the perpetrators were protected by state and local officials.

The announcement, which immediately brought new criticism of the administration&#8217;s detention practices, included few details. It stated only that the unidentified detainee was a Saudi Arabian and that he &#8220;was found unresponsive and not breathing in his cell by guards&#8221; early yesterday afternoon. It said lifesaving efforts were exhausted but did not make clear why the officials had concluded that the death was a suicide. A spokesman at the naval station at Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba, where about 380 men are held, referred calls to the United States Southern Command in Miami, which posted the announcement on its Web site. The death comes almost a year after three suicides at Guant&#225;namo last June, which drew international attention. Some critics of the Bush administration said the suicides were testament to desperation in the detention camps. But the commander at the time, Rear Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., asserted that &#8220;this was not an act of desperation, but an act of asymmetrical warfare waged against us.&#8221; The death yesterday seemed to mark the end of a period of relative calm in which officials have appeared to take extraordinary steps to avoid detainee suicides, including force-feeding hunger strikers to assure they receive adequate nutrition. Admiral Harris completed his tour of duty at Guant&#225;namo this month and said at the time that the camp was in a much less turbulent state than last year. Several of the detainees&#8217; lawyers have said in recent months that the psychological condition of many of the detainees was markedly deteriorating. They said that some detainees had begun to feel that they would never emerge alive from Guant&#225;namo, which was opened at a detention camp more than five years ago. Some of the lawyers have publicly warned that more suicides are inevitable. Last night, one of those lawyers, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan, said that if the Saudi death was a suicide it was a public sign of the hopelessness at the camp. &#8220;It was simply a matter of time before this suicide,&#8221; Mr. Colangelo-Bryan said, &#8220;and I imagine it is only a matter of time before the next.&#8221; He said that detainees in their sixth year of detention speak of being told that they have no legal rights and will never leave Guant&#225;namo. American officials have said they have decided that about 80 of the detainees can be released, but that few countries have been willing to accept them. Military officials have said they may bring war-crimes charges against about 80 others. The remainder are being held as enemy combatants, and the Bush administration has argued that it can hold them until they cease to become a danger or until the war against terrorism is compete. The Pentagon conducts annual reviews of the detainees to asses whether they are still properly classified as enemy combatants. Anant P. Raut, a Washington lawyer who represents 5 of about 80 Saudi detainees at Guant&#225;namo, said he had not been told as of last night of the condition of his clients. He said that when he visited Guant&#225;namo in February his clients had difficulty understanding why they were still there if the government was not planning to charge them with war crimes. Mr. Raut said yesterday&#8217;s death should bring a thorough assessment of why a detainee might have committed suicide. &#8220;The conditions that led to this have to be re-examined,&#8221; he said.

Local News 7-Day Archive Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Wed, May. 30, 2007 reprint or license this Ohio soldier killed after helicopter crashes in Iraq A soldier from Ohio was among two based at the Schofield Barracks in Honolulu who were killed in Iraq this week, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Chief Warrant Officer Theodore U. Church of South Point, Ohio and 1st Lt. Keith N. Heidtman of Norwich, Conn. died from wounds sustained when their helicopter crashed after being hit by enemy fire. Church's family in Ohio asked the Army to tell the media they wanted to grieve in private, a Schofield public affairs official said. Church was 32 years old. Heidtman, 24, was a graduate of Norwich Free Academy and the University of Connecticut. He arrived in Iraq in December and was scheduled to come home for leave in July. Church and Heidtman were among 10 U.S. soldiers who died in roadside bombings and the helicopter crash on Monday, the military reported, making May the deadliest month of the year for U.S. troops in Iraq. Eight of those killed were from Task Force Lightning. Six were killed in an insurgent roadside bomb ambush as they raced to rescue the two who died in the helicopter crash. The military did not say if the helicopter was shot down or had mechanical problems. All eight died in Diyala province north of the capital. "We know that the helicopter had received ground fire, but do not know yet the cause of the helicopter going down," Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, a military spokesman, said in an interview with Associated Press Radio. Heidtman and Church were assigned to the 2nd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, 25th Combat Aviation Brigade in the 25th Infantry Division. About the Real Cities Network Terms of Use & Privacy Statement

By Mark Berkey-Gerard | May 31, 2007, 8:10 am Update: Sonny Carson Avenue The dispute over whether to rename a portion of a Brooklyn street for black activist Sonny Carson sharply split the City Council today. With support from the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, Councilmember Albert Vann introduced an amendment to add Sonny Carson Avenue back to the street renaming package bill. The move failed. Carson Avenue, along with the rest of the street name proposals had been and removed from the street renaming bill after a contentious vote in the parks committee. Councilmembers, the media and the public have of honoring Carson and the process by which streets are renamed. At today&#8217;s meeting, Vann urged his colleagues to vote their conscience and emphasized the importance of honoring the wishes of local communities. Earlier, Vann connected the issue to self-determination and freedom, If you tell us who we cannot honor today, youll tell us who we cannot worship tomorrow. On Memorial Day, Councilmember Charles Barron led an effort to rename a Brooklyn park after Sonny Carson by putting up new signs.  Today, Barron spoke at length on the issue, singling out Letitia James for abstaining from voting on Sonny Carson Avenue while on the Parks Committee and criticizing Council Speaker Christine Quinns efforts to block the renaming. Quinn responded by emphasizing that those who the city honors with street names must reflect the citys core values and principles and unite, not divide, us. Before the meeting, Barron, who has referenced the numerous streets named after slaveholders and the councils honoring of entertainer Al Jolson who dressed in blackface, spoke about the controversial Irish New Yorkers and members of the Irish Republican Army who had been honored by the city in the past and supported by the local African American community. Spectators in the crowded City Hall chambers chanted Whose streets? Our streets. Whose streets? Sonnys streets? and self-determination, but the council voted against adding Sonny Carson Avenue with 15 in favor of the amendment, 25 against and 6 abstaining.  Some councilmembers voiced concerns about the process as they voted no, while others cited allegedly hateful comments by Carson as they emphatically voted no.  By Sydney Beveridge | May 30, 2007, 5:31 pm In a year of special elections, next Tuesday offers another one: Residents of Manhattans East Side will chose a member of the State Assembly to replace , who left the legislature to become Governor Eliot Spitzers environment commissioner. The race has revived the debate over how undemocratic (small d) special elections for the legislature are as select candidates with little to no involvement by rank and file members.

But Kellner has declined a June 4 debate citing that old standby schedule conflicts. And Camp won the of Citizens Union (whose sister organization, , publishes Gotham Gazette). The groups executive director, Dick Dadey, told the that Camps perceived independence helped him win the support. &#8221;Unlike his opponent, [Camp] didn&#8217;t come out of the political clubs and the current political establishment. He would be a fresh voice,&#8221; Dadey said. But longtime political consultant Joseph Mercurio thinks Camp has an almost insurmountable handicap: George Bush. Unfairly or not, Mercurio , voters will link Camp to Bush and the war.

Examining a new health department , Motor vehicles are still the leading cause of accidental child deaths in New York City; 85 percent of motor-vehicle-related deaths involved children who were pedestrians. The rate was highest in Brooklyn, to wonder whether a shortage of parks prompts kids to play in the street. And in another posting, Charles Koumanoff crunches homicide and traffic death statistics for New York City and Long Island and finds that violent deaths do not stop at the city line. Per million people, Long Island had 51 fewer homicides , but 50 more traffic fatalities  than New York City. In terms of total violent deaths, the difference between the Big Apple and Long Island - 105 deaths per million people in the City, 104 on the Island - is statistical noise, he writes.

The problems at the building department, he writes add up to a major scandal. More shocking, the agency&#8217;s near collapse apparently comes as a surprise to Mayor Bloomberg. But perhaps its not so shocking after all. Goodwin quotes Assemblymember Jim Brennan as commenting, &#8221;The people at the top, the mayor and Dan Doctoroff, are in ecstasy over all the construction. But they&#8217;re not perceiving the dark side of what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; And why might that be? According to Goodwin, If they don&#8217;t see it now, it&#8217;s only because they don&#8217;t want to.

But New York&#8217;s judges do not fare as well as their counterparts. The National Center for State Courts released a report finding that New Yorks judges are paid less than judges in 36 other states (adjusted for cost of living).  Chief Justice Judith Kaye earns $156,000 &#8212; about the same amount as a first-year associate at a top New York City law firm. Like the members of the legislature, New York judges have not had a pay raise since 1999. connecting judicial pay raises to legislative pay raises and creating a separate commission to handle such decisions disintegrated when negotiations on campaign finance reform legislation unraveled. And Kaye has warned that she might sue Governor Eliot Spitzer and the legislature if they do not increase judicial salaries before the end of the session in June.  By Sydney Beveridge | May 30, 2007, 7:06 am The day after the country honored its war dead, the chastises Washington for not doing more to help one group killed and injured in an act of war: Ground Zero workers suffering illnesses as a result of the 9/11 attacks. No one in the Bush administration, the News says, is standing up for these forgotten victims of 9/11. Most shamefully, Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt has postured as an ally for the sick and conducted himself as their enemy. The editorial slams Leavitt&#8217;s department for wanting more and more data to figure out what&#8217;s happening and how to respond. This is paralysis by analysis - a deliberate tactic to delay and dodge. But on the other side of the tabloid feuds, the sees a rush to judgment on 9/11 related illnesses. In particular the paper protests last weeks ruling by the medical examiner that a lower Manhattan on the morning of the attacks later died because of her exposure to dust from Ground Zero. The question of 9/11&#8217;s impact on public health is far too important to be decided on the basis of fears, well-meaning sympathy for those who become ill or the financial ramifications of compensating victims, the editorial says.

With the United States accused of dragging its feet on combatting climate change, Bush called for a meeting this fall of 15 countries identified as major emitters of greenhouse gases. This list would include the United States, China, India and major European countries. The president outlined his proposal in a speech ahead of next week's summit in Germany of leading industrialized nations, where global warming is to be a major topic. Bush urged other nations to eliminate tariffs on clean energy technologies. Germany, which holds the European Union and Group of Eight presidencies, is proposing a so-called "two-degree" target, whereby global temperatures would be allowed to increase no more than 2 degrees Celsius &#8212; the equivalent of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit &#8212; before being brought back down. Practically, experts have said that means a global reduction in emissions of 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The United States has rejected that approach. Instead, Bush called for nations to hold a series of meetings, beginning this fall, to set a global emission goal. Each nation then would have to decide on how to achieve the goal, White House officials said. Bush's critics were quick to respond, even before the president's speech had concluded. Daniel J. Weiss, climate strategy director for the liberal Center for American Progress, said the Bush administration has a "do-nothing" policy on global warming despite U.S. allies' best efforts to spur U.S. reductions. "Our allies' pleas for action add to the voices of many big corporations such as Dow, Shell, General Electric, and General Motors," Weiss said. "These and other Fortune 500 companies endorsed a 60 percent to 80 percent reduction in global warming pollution by 2050, the level scientists indicate that we must reach to stave off the worst impacts. Unfortunately, these appeals from his foreign and corporate allies continue to fall on President Bush's deaf ears." The U.S. last year actually experienced a drop in emissions of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas most blamed for global warming. The 1.3 percent decline from 2005, the first drop in 11 years, was due to a mild winter followed by a cool summer. Carbon dioxide is produced from burning fossil fuels, including natural gas and coal, which are used widely to produce electricity to heat homes in winter and run air conditioners in summer. While Bush announced his new proposal, the administration registered its opposition to a number of approaches to combat global warming. Specifically, the White House said it does not support a global carbon-trading program allowing countries to buy and sell carbon credits to meet limits on carbon dioxide levels. The White House also expressed opposition to energy efficiency targets advocated by the EU, arguing that a standard applicable in one country does not fit another.

Many Germans remember him as the likeable mediator who helped bring about German reunification. But Zoellick's maxim is still "America first." Robert Zoellick, the designated president of the World Bank, stands next to US President George W. Bush. Robert Zoellick will be the first World Bank president to take office already decorated with the Federal Cross of Merit, Germany's distinguished state honorary badge. His predecessors John McCloy and Jim Wolfensohn also received the Cross -- but only later. Zoellick already wears it, in recognition of his efforts to help bring about German reunification. As the main United States mediator in the "Two Plus Four Agreement" -- the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany that emerged from the 1990 talks between the two German states and the four World War II victors, and which led to German reunification -- he vigorously championed German self-determination. The Germans thanked him by awarding him the order. On Wednesday, US President George W. Bush will nominate Zoellick as the successor to controversial World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz. In Germany, Zoellick is considered a friend, an "Atlanticist" and a bridge-builder. He once described his bond with Berlin in a speech here as a common, German-American vision of the future, a transition to "prosperity, security and hope for hundreds of millions of people." They were grand words from the designated top creditor to the world. His nomination was quickly interpreted as a technical victory for the moderates, since he was considered the favored candidate of the Europeans, of developing countries and even of the World Bank's critics. His nomination could therefore be seen as a gesture of reconciliation on the part of US President George W. Bush. But 53-year-old Zoellick knows what he wants -- which is to say, he knows what his superior in Washington wants. The crisis manager's right-hand man He is, after all, an old friend of the Bush family -- and he shares its conviction that the United States is the only qualified world power today. Zoellick, who grew up as a descendant of German immigrants in Illinois, was one of the prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of James Baker, the Bush clan's perennial crisis manager and the Secretary of State under George H.W. Bush. As Baker's right-hand man, the junior diplomat hammered out the foreign policy conditions of German unity during the "Two Plus Four" talks in the summer of 1990. When George W. Bush, then still the governor of Texas, set his sights on the White House, Zoellick was part of an intimate circle of advisors led by later National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. They called themselves "the Vulcans" and they sought to transform him into a man of the world. Bush returned the favor by making Zoellick, a Harvard graduate, part of his government: first as US Trade Representative and then as Deputy Secretary of State. There was already talk, for a brief time, of Zoellick possibly becoming president of the World Bank in 2005. But Bush opted for the neoconservative Wolfowitz at the time -- the architect of the war in Iraq whom Bush had to somehow quickly give a sideways promotion so he could get him out of the Pentagon. "There is still evil in the world" But opinions diverge over Zoellick's ideological alignment. Conservatives describe him as a "man of the center" (in the words of German daily ) and as a champion of international alliances. But those on the left view him as a special brand of neoconservative: one who is less ideological and disguises himself for pragmatic reasons, but still quietly sympathizes with the neoconservative cause. Zoellick is "moderate" only by comparison to Wolfowitz and his former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith, a classic neoconservative, writes Tom Barry, the director of the left-leaning International Relations Center. Zoellick himself accepts the "the neoconservative premise of US global supremacy" but wants to "wisely manage that power," according to Barry. He's not an ideologist, then, but an idealist: As early as one year before George W. Bush took office in January of 2001, Zoellick articulated his ideas about a "Republican foreign policy" in an essay for . The United States would shape the future world order on the basis of its military supremacy, Zoellick wrote, predicting the events of the years to come. "A modern Republican foreign policy," he wrote, "recognizes that there is still evil in the world." Bush himself couldn't have said it better. What is certain is that Zoellick consistently pushed for the liberalization of world trade under both Bush presidents. It was his own brand of war against "evil." He helped save the Uruguay Round, the trade negotiation lasting from September 1986 to April 1994 which transformed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) into the World Trade Organization (WTO). He jockeyed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) out of its crisis. He lowered trade barriers to the Third World -- an aspect of his record that helped him in the competition for his new position at the World Bank -- and enjoys a favorable reputation in African, Latin American and Asian countries. He brought China into the WTO -- an achievement of which he was personally especially proud. The humanitarian crisis in Darfur was his most recent priority. "Not on our watch" was the motto on a bracelet he wore during a 2005 visit to a Darfur refugee camp. In total, he traveled to Sudan four times and was involved in the negotiation of a peace agreement with the rebels there last year. He was considered one of Washington's strongest voices in Darfur.

He became a managing director for the Goldman Sachs investment bank. Burned-out government members had frequently found jobs there in the past. When Bush charged his Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson -- Goldman's former CEO -- with finding a successor for Wolfowitz, it was therefore no great surprise that Paulson found a candidate in his former firm.

Army 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman, 24, was the 37th military member with Connecticut ties to die since the war began in 2002. Two Connecticut civilians have also been killed. Heidtman was one of 10 U.S. soldiers who died in roadside bombings and the helicopter crash on Monday, the military reported. Eight of the soldiers were from Task Force Lightning _ six killed when explosions hit near their vehicles and two in a helicopter crash. Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the crash as part of a "complex" attack by enemy forces who first shot down the helicopter, then used roadside bombs to kill troops rushing to the site. Wiggins said the military believes the aircraft was brought down by small arms fire. He added that the roadside bomb that killed a response team headed to the crash site was not the newer, armor-piercing explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs, that have killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers. Such a complex attack, he said, is "not new. That's something that's been out there, but it's something that they're continuing to refine." Heidtman was a 2001 graduate of Norwich Free Academy and a graduate of the University of Connecticut. Gov. M. Jodi Rell has ordered all state and U.S. flags to fly at half staff in Heidtman's memory. His co-pilot was Army Chief Warrant Officer Theodore Church, 32, of South Point, Ohio. Both were assigned to the 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii. Funeral arrangements for Heidtman have not been announced. Subscribe to Newsday home delivery Article licensing and reprint options Post a comment |

Opponents of Paul Wolfowitz during his presidency of the bank largely applauded Mr Zoellick&#8217;s nomination by President Bush, hoping that it would help to restore the reputation of an organisation that was tainted by the regime of his predecessor. Pending confirmation by the board of the lender to the developing world, Mr Zoellick will start on June 30. &#8220;Mr Zoellick is certainly the right man for the job,&#8221; Bernard Kouchner, the French Foreign Minister, said, referring to Mr Wolfowitz&#8217;s two years in charge as a &#8220;dark chapter&#8221;. A spokesman for the British Department for International Development described Mr Zoellick, 53, as a &#8220;very credible candidate&#8221;. The German Government, a key opponent of Mr Wolfowitz, threw its weight behind the nomination and Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, said that she was impressed by Mr Zoellick, noting that &#8220;he&#8217;s sensitive to the alleviation of poverty&#8221;. The reaction contrasted starkly with Mr Wolfowitz&#8217;s appointment in 2005, which was widely opposed by European leaders because his background was thought to be versed in war rather than in poverty reduction. Although Mr Wolfowitz joined the bank after four years as US Deputy Secretary of Defence, during which he was defined by his role as a key architect of the Iraq war, Mr Zoellick is regarded as a leading light of the Doha Round of talks designed to promote free trade between countries, rich and poor. Mr Wolfowitz&#8217;s presidency was notable for his single-minded pursuit of an ideology &#150; corruption was his primary bugbear &#150; and he shunned many regimes that he perceived to be rife with bribery in a manner that many Europeans believed was heavy-handed and at odds with the bank&#8217;s primary role of reducing poverty. When it emerged that Mr Wolfowitz had arranged a substantial pay rise for Shaha Riza, his girlfriend and a World Bank employee, his opponents saw their chance, and, after a fight, he resigned on May 17. Mr Zoellick is thought to more realistic about the political cultures of the countries that the World Bank seeks to help and is willing to adapt his stance to achieve the best outcome under the circumstances. His management approach is thought to contrast with that of Mr Wolfowitz, who alienated many long-time senior World Bank staff members by circumventing them and working with a tight-knit group of former Bush advisers. Zoellick&#8217;s presentational skills are not silky-smooth. He can be abrasive, but he is a consensus-builder who canvasses the opinions of colleagues. James Lucier, a senior political analyst at Prudential, said that despite the differences between Mr Zoellick and Mr Wolfowitz, they shared fundamentally similar views. &#8220;No one ever got fired for buying an IBM,&#8221; Mr Lucier said. &#8220;Zoellick has an unimpeachable brand name, an impeccable r&#233;sum&#233;, and no one could ever be challenged for appointing him. &#8220;But he, like Wolfowitz, is part of the Vulcan group of neo-con advisers that worked on Bush&#8217;s 2000 campaign. He is more pragmatic and more politic, but he is just as likely to shine a spotlight on the dark recesses of Africa or an inept government as Wolfowitz. &#8220;But he won&#8217;t do it in an unpalatable way and won&#8217;t draw attention to himself while he does it.&#8221; * Town / City Save to my times Also in United States US economy slows to 4-year low Longest-serving FTSE 100 chief executives Barclays pays $11m to settle US insider trading suit LSE reaches new high on continuing bid talk Matthey helps FTSE drive higher BP's criticised refining head John Manzoni quits Government to raise &pound;2.2bn from British Energy Chinese tax move sends markets lower Your Browser doesn't support Inline frames Your Browser doesn't support Inline frames Investment ideas from leading market commentators Search our comprehensive database of funds and compare the top performers Read our quick guide on how to minimise inheritance tax Cunningly, Honda has tried to mask a lack of oomph by fitting the new Civic Type R with a suspension system that, plainly, is made out of bricks Overseas contacts and local information for your business Tailor-made section with features and news for the Business Traveller She relied on an oxygen machine.

In response to more than 3,900 public comments, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials decided to lower a few fees from the original proposal, including green-card renewal for children under 14, and to expand the availability of fee waivers and exemptions, but the rest of the increases remain as proposed. The exceptions announced by the USCIS won't make much of a difference and don't change the fact the fees represent a very steep increase, especially for working-class families, said Tucson immigration attorney Patricia Mejia. "They are just going to have balance it out and figure it out if it's worth it," Mejia said. "I think most will still file and just do away with other things." The final fee structure â which includes increases of more than 100 percent in some categoriesâ goes into effect on July 30 for all applications postmarked or filed on or after that date. "There's going to be a massive surge of people filing before the deadline," Mejia said. "It will be akin to the April 15 deadline for taxes." That surge has already begun. At least 6,129 immigrants submitted citizenship applications in Arizona from January through April, a 49 percent increase from the 4,094 who started the process in the same time period in 2006, figures from Citizenship and Immigration Services show. Nationally, at least 118,600 immigrants took the first step to request citizenship in March, compared to about 74,200 a year before, a 60 percent increase. The increase can be attributed not only to the upcoming fee increases but also to anxiety about a new citizenship test, ongoing immigration reform debate and more efforts nationwide to encourage eligible candidates to apply for citizenship, said Marie Sebrechts, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokeswoman. "We have seen a steady increase in the past year but we can't really tie it to the fees because we have had so many things going on," Sebrechts said. "It's really a combination, it's hard to pin it on one thing." Citizenship officials say the increases are necessary for the fee-based agency â which doesn't receive funding from Congress â to recover its costs and reduce backlogs. The agency established the new fee structure after an eight-month internal review suggested by a 2004 Government Accountability Office report that found that current fees weren't covering costs. The agency expects the increased fees to lead to a 20 percent reduction in average application processing times by the end of fiscal year 2009. It is promising reductions by the end of fiscal year 2008 for people filing to become a legal permanent residents or U.S. citizens, renewing a green card or petitioning for an immigrant worker. An application for citizenship, including biometric encoding, would climb to $675 from $400; an application to become a permanent resident would rise to $1,010 from $395. The latter would be partially offset by the elimination of fees applicants have to pay while waiting for the green cards, officials said. The revisions from the February proposal include: â A 25 percent reduction to the filing fee to become a legal permanent resident for children under 14, which officials say will mean a $360 decrease from what was proposed for a family of two adults and two children filing together. â A one-time free extension of approved orphan petitions for prospective adoptive parents. â The expansion of availability of fee waivers for some cases that arise from asylum or other humanitarian categories, and for certain juvenile immigrants. â The ability for the agency to waive the $80 biometric costs of getting fingerprints, photographs and signatures on an individual basis.

"This is my resignation letter as the 'face' of the American anti-war movement," Sheehan said in a Memorial Day posting Monday on the Web site Daily Kos. Sheehan became a leading voice against the Iraq conflict after her son, Casey, was killed in combat in 2004. She was a frequent protester in President George W. Bush's adopted hometown of Crawford, Texas. She began visiting Crawford in the summer of 2005 when she wanted to meet with Bush while he was vacationing at his ranch. Bush had met with her after her son died but did not see her again, although he sent two top aides to talk to her. The White House had no comment on Sheehan's announcement. Sheehan said she had reached the conclusion over the Memorial Day holiday that her son "did indeed die for nothing" and was "killed by his own country which is beholden to and run by a war machine that even controls what we think." "Our brave young men and women in Iraq have been abandoned there indefinitely by their cowardly leaders who move them around like pawns on a chessboard of destruction," she wrote. Sheehan criticized Democrats, saying they had turned against her when she tried to hold them to the same standards she held Republicans. And she expressed frustration with an anti-war movement that she said "often puts personal egos above peace and human life." "I am going to take whatever I have left and go home," she wrote. "I am going to go home and be a mother to my surviving children and try to regain some of what I have lost." "Good-bye America ... you are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it," she said. "It's up to you now." Democrats have been under increasing pressure from liberal groups to turn the tide against the Iraq war since they took control of Congress this year. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Facts & Figures - Landmine casualties (2004) Nicaragua latest to grab tainted Chinese toothpaste Drug-resistant TB patient hopscotched across Europe Russia, U.S. spar on Kosovo, missile shield US says 2 companies recall tainted feed additives Seven dead in NATO helicopter crash in Afghanistan Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision Lauds Bush Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA Iraqi refugee children begin education programmes Source: WV MEERO - Cyprus Catholic Relief Services urges Congress to preserve US long-term development food aid initiatives that fight chronic hunger Source: CRS - USA Annual report &#8211; ICRC boosts aid in face of growing conflict and displacement Source: ICRC - Switzerland The International Red Cross helps Australian-Palestinians, who were visiting family in the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp, retrieve their belongings in northern Lebanon May 30, 2007.

The argument divided councilmembers and the audience along racial lines and grew so heated that there were numerous calls for order. Afterward, as the crowd dispersed, there were chants of "Whose streets? Our streets!" and "Black power!" Tempers had been simmering since last month, after a measure was introduced to rename a Brooklyn street after Sonny Abubadika Carson, a local leader who once called himself "anti-white." His name was initially part of a package of 51 street renamings, alongside New Yorkers such as actor Jerry Orbach and firefighters killed in the line of duty, but it was stricken from the group last month when objections were raised over his history. Carson, who died in 2002, was an important figure in the city's black community throughout the 1980s. He led protests against police brutality and founded the Black Men's Movement Against Crack, among other things. His autobiography, "The Education of Sonny Carson," was turned into a movie. Carson also served 15 months in prison after his arrest in 1974 on murder, attempted murder and kidnapping charges. He was convicted of the kidnapping charge; prosecutors said he had ordered two shootings as acts of revenge. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn were among those who opposed honoring Carson. Quinn said Carson had a long history of being "divisive," and Bloomberg said it was difficult to think of anyone less worthy of the tribute. "We as a City Council have an obligation," Quinn said, "to make sure that when we honor New Yorkers with our vote on street renamings that we do it for individuals who meet the core values of the city of New York, for individuals who were united, not divisive." The 51-member council, which typically rubber-stamps street renaming bills without fanfare, was scheduled to vote on the package Wednesday without Carson's name. But during the meeting, Councilman Al Vann, who is black, proposed an amendment to put Carson back into the bill. The move was defeated by a vote of 25 to 15, with seven abstentions and a few members absent. No black councilmembers voted against the amendment, although some abstained, and just one of the 15 "yes" voters was white. Carson supporters framed the moment not as a decision about an amendment but as a symbol of something larger after decades of racial strife. "A street naming sounds so innocuous, so routine," Vann said. "And yet ... you've hit a nerve, you harken back to a time that we've already overcome _ you're infringing upon our human right." Those pushing for the amendment said the City Council should not have authority to decide who a community can honor. Some said the racial split would last beyond the day. Councilman Charles Barron, who is black, suggested that white councilmembers who voted "no" and have aspirations for future citywide office would "remember this day" when they need black support for their campaigns. "You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever divided anything," Barron told Quinn, who is white and is among the potential candidates for mayor in 2009. Like all street renamings that reach the council, a community board preapproved the measure that sought to designate a few blocks along Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant as Sonny Abubadika Carson Way. Many of the figures honored in the names of the city's streets, parks and squares have questionable pasts that include slave ownership, anti-Semitism and adultery. There was Peter Stuyvesant, director general of New Netherland in the 1600s, who sought to prevent Jews from entering the colony; Revolutionary War general Horatio Gates, who owned slaves, and Austin Corbin, a real-estate developer and owner of the Long Island Rail Road in the late 1880s, who reportedly excluded Jews from his hotels. There is also Al Jolson, an entertainer who appeared in blackface. The question of how to honor historical figures is a familiar one. In the South, for example, there has been debate about streets, schools, parks and government buildings named for slave owners or others with Confederate ties. Alice Bowsher, a Birmingham, Ala., historic preservationist and adviser to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said it is difficult to imagine any figure passing every test, and she said controversial namesakes can present opportunities for learning and healthy debate. "It's hard to find a perfect person, and if someone has flaws in their life or character, that's not necessarily a reason that something shouldn't be named after them," she said. "All of the Founding Fathers, and plenty of others _ we're all in the same boat of not leading perfect lives."

As the Symmes Township eighth-grader approached the microphone for the third time Wednesday at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, she clasped her hands and smiled sweetly.

Marissa took the direct way, spelling the word correctly to earn her spot among the nation's top 59 spellers, They will compete in this morning's semifinals, which will be broadcast live on ESPN. "I was able to piece it together through the roots," she said. Marissa correctly spelled "particular" and aced a 25-question written exam to be among the 107 spellers who advanced to Wednesday's quarterfinals, where she also correctly spelled "inertia." "It's always a little nerve-wracking, but I just try to focus on the word and on the judges," she said. Tony Otten of Erlanger, Ky., also a 13-year-old eighth-grader, spelled his first word correctly - "optimism" - but was eliminated after the morning round because of his score on the challenging written test. &raquo; Good speller makes semifinals Baker ends extradition battle Good speller makes semifinals Sales tax hike approved Ohio 4 Bypass fixup OK'd 'They were good girls and good friends' Lifeguard revives baby at pool 'It is insane that he did this' Anderson tackles sexual predators How did steel beam kill boy?

The highest previous death toll in Iraq for Fort Lewis soldiers was nine in December 2004. Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif., and Pfc. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami, died Monday when an improvised explosive device went off near them during a foot patrol in Baghdad, the Pentagon said. Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho, died two days earlier in Baghdad when the vehicle he was riding in struck another IED, the Pentagon said. McFall and Sanchez were infantrymen assigned to 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (Stryker Brigade Combat Team). Hester was an infantryman assigned to the other Fort Lewis-based Stryker brigade serving in and around Baghdad, 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. The two brigades represent about 8,000 soldiers serving in and around Baghdad who, along with other Army combat units and Iraqi security forces, are trying to rid the region of insurgents and quell sectarian violence. Command Sgt. Maj. Gerald Williams, who is serving on an interim basis as the posts senior noncommissioned officer, said losing a soldier never is easy, and the Army post grieves with news of each death. The soldiers commitment to continue the fight hasnt wavered and morale remains high, he added. We stand together with each other to make a difference every day, Williams said. McFall joined the Army in October 1994 and served tours in South Korea and Afghanistan. He reported to Fort Lewis for a second time in September 2005. His wife, Emily, said her husband loved listening to classic rock and cooking ribs on the grill. He would tell peers leaving the military that the Army was the easiest job in the world, she said. He loved the brotherhood and his heart beat red, white and blue; there was only one exit, Emily McFall said. Hester and Sanchez were serving in their first combat deployments. Hester enlisted in May 2004 and arrived at Fort Lewis that September, and Sanchez joined Nov. 9, 2005, and came to the Army post in June 2006. Family members for both soldiers couldnt be reached for comment. Today, Fort Lewis will hold a memorial service for Sgt. Iosiwo Uruo, a 27-year-old native of Guam, who died May 24 when his unit came under enemy fire. His will be among the final individual memorial services for soldiers at Fort Lewis. In a May 22 memo obtained by United for Peace Pierce County, Brig. Gen. William Troy, Fort Lewis acting commanding general, wrote that the number of fallen soldiers prevents post officials from conducting individual services. He directed the posts senior chaplain to draft a policy set to take effect next month. Fort Lewis plans to hold a memorial service once a month for its fallen soldiers. The details are still being worked out, Fort Lewis spokesman Joe Piek said. He noted that four services typically are held to honor a fallen soldier. The soldiers unit holds one in theater; a second at the Army post for the greater community that family members sometimes attend; the third organized by family in the soldiers hometown; and the fourth a burial with military honors.

Brent Bozell III Frank J. Gaffney Jr. Phantom of the Movies Clicks and Mortar Column Dispatches from the Gulf The World & I Add To Insider Newsclips Thompson ready to test &#39;08 waters at state GOP gala Fred Thompson (Getty Images) Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson will be coming to Virginia as part of an effort to drum up support among conservative voters. The "Law & Order" star, who is said to be "testing the waters" for a 2008 presidential run, will be the keynote speaker at the Republican Party of Virginia&#39;s 2007 Commonwealth Gala Saturday in Richmond. His attendance will be the latest high-profile appearance orchestrated by Ed Gillespie, state party chairman and former Republican National Committee chairman who worked with Mr. Thompson in 2005 on the confirmation of Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Mr. Thompson would likely appeal to conservative voters thus far dissatisfied with Republican front-runners Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York mayor; Arizona Sen. John McCain; and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. "If the election was tomorrow, and conservatives had to go to the polls and vote for one of these three leading guys, then a lot of conservatives would probably stay home," said state Delegate Jeffrey M. Frederick, Prince William Republican. "The three leading candidates in the race right now all have problems with the conservative base -- significant problems -- and I think that conservatives nationally are looking for a bona fide conservative candidate. Someone who is not a fringe candidate either, but one that actually can win." Many Virginia conservatives argue that Republicans lost in last year&#39;s elections because they forgot conservative principles, particularly limited government. And now President Bush is being criticized for pushing an immigration proposal that conservatives say awards amnesty to illegal aliens. Conservatives "are very unhappy with the state of the party,"said Craig Shirley, an Alexandria-based Republican strategist. Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, this month helped the state party raise about $630,000 at a gathering in Goochland County. The party plans on putting much of the money into tight races in this fall&#39;s elections, when all 140 General Assembly seats will be up for grabs and Republicans will work to keep control of the state House and Senate. A Thompson candidacy is intriguing to Virginia voters looking for a conservative like Ronald Reagan, said state Delegate L. Scott Lingamfelter, Prince William Republican. "As I go door to door, I am surprised with how many people have [Mr. Thompson] on their mind, which tells me that many in the base are still looking" for the right candidate, he said. "People are looking for someone who is consistent across the board. And when you look at some of the candidates, I think they may have good leadership skills, but are inconsistent on the issues, or they are consistent on the issues, but don&#39;t have good leadership skills." Mr. Thompson, who served in the Senate from 1994 to 2003, has placed third or higher in some national polls without even entering the race. Add To Insider Newsclips Want to use this article?

Many of my blog readers think I am in the bag for Romney based on my bookâs disclosure that if the California primary had been held the day the book appeared I would have voted for Romney. That assessment still holds, but as the book noted, campaigns are long, strange affairs. People cry in the back of trucks. Candidates grab microphones and fall off stages. Even presidents can make astonishing errors in their appearances, and they have the best advance team in the world. So a lot can happen between now and next January and February. Fred Thompson is yet another entrant in the GOP lists who is serious about the war, making that unanimous agreement among the GOP top tier versus a unanimous endorsement of retreat and date certain defeat among the Democrats. Thereâs the defining issue f the general campaign. One of the defining issues of the primary campaign will be the immigration bill, and it has defined John McCain right out of his already thin chance to be the nominee. He has now added McCain-Kennedy 2.0 to McCain-Feingold, The Gang of 14, McCain-Kennedy 1.0 and the display of pique last September on the trial and treatment of terrorists in an impressive bid to antagonize every conservative on at least two grounds. I donât think he makes it to Iowa and the humiliation of fourth place finishes there and in New Hampshire. As the Post notes, Thompson bleeds McCain immediately, giving all the early McCain boosters who thought they were signing up for a front-runner certain to benefit from the GOPâs ânext-in-lineâ tradition of nominees a chance for a Mulligan. Do-overs are rare in politics, but the unexpected arrival on the scene of an âold friendâ presents just such an opportunity. Mayor Giuliani and Governor Romney might lose some folks as well, but their supporters signed up for something completely different than a coronation, and thus far they are getting exactly what they ought to have expected: vibrant and interesting campaigns by candidates of the sort that donât normally show up in the GOP primaries. Fred Thompson arrives with many on the sidelines whispering Reagan. Perhaps, but just perhaps. President Reagan was a Californian, not a southerner, an upbeat and sunny optimist who had spent 16 years on the chicken circuit helping the party, and having made one unsuccessful run for the GOP nomination. Few Republicans every thought to raise questions about Reaganâs fire in the belly. What Republicans really want is a candidate capable of handling the coming onslaught. There is a great fear in the GOP that Hillary is approaching with Bill in the sidecar and Senator Obama on the bottom of the ticket, MoveOn and Kosputin whipping the fever swamp into a frenzy and Soros pouring his last cent into his last play. Thompson as Reagan meant for a lot of these people not Thompson as a conservative's conservative, but Thompson as a powerful candidate capable of summoning a huge outpouring of energy and enthusiasm from the base and the old Reagan Democrats alike leading to a big win as in 1980 and 1984. Couldn't we please have a candidate who could establish and keep a lead like the Gipper. Except, of course, Ronald Reagan did not establish and keep a lead in 1980. Until the last few days of the race, President Carter and Governor Reagan were viewed as neck-and-neck in a race too close to call. There isn't any reason to believe that Fred would have any easier a go of it than Rudy or Mitt, and as that becomes obvious in the days and weeks and months after his entry, the folks hoping for an easy win are going to drop that enthusiasm and start looking hard again at all three, asking which one is the best candidate. These are the Al Davis Republicans --"Just win, baby"-- and their support will be decisive in 1Q08. One reason I suspect the Fred boom may be over before it has even really begun is the recognition that on the stump Fred will be seen as the southerner he is --slow, folksy, plain spoken. In a year when an anti-Bush may be needed, a Brooklyn-born Mob-busting tough guy, or the hyper-intelligent, hyper-eloquent investment banker turnaround executive may emerge quickly as far more likely to be the "something completely different " that Reagan was in 1980, and thus the strong preference of the Al Davis GOPers. Too early to say, and besides, no one in my business would want a rout one way or the other. A long campaign of intense debates and lots of press attacks and parries is exactly what the eventual nominee will need to be in fighting shape for the fall of â08. Hillary is not going to get bloodied along the way as Senators Edwards and Obama know better than to poke that nest. Sheâll process to Denver, and then when the storm arrives weâll see which party had the better approach.

House votes to legalize medical use of marijuana HARTFORD &#151; The House of Representatives, after six hours of debate that touched on many lawmakers' own experiences with debilitating illness, approved a bill Wednesday that would legalize the medical use of marijuana for certain patients. The bill passed on a 89-58 vote. It moves to the Senate, where a similar bill passed in 2005. That bill then failed in the House. Rep. Toni Boucher, R-Wilton, tried in vain to change the bill. She had filed about 50 amendments, but called only eight. They ranged from requiring the Department of Agriculture to set up a pilot program for medical marijuana patients to providing local police departments with the names of people using the drug for palliative purposes. "This should not be compared with other medications that doctors prescribe," said Boucher, who warned lawmakers they are embarking on "a dangerous direction." She voted against it. Connecticut lawmakers have grappled with the issue for the last five years. Supporters say it's needed to legally protect people who try to obtain the illegal drug to help stem the draining effects of diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. Tribune's deal to sell some papers to Gannett called off CHICAGO &#151; Tribune Co. disclosed Friday afternoon that its earlier agreement to sell two Connecticut newspapers to Gannett Co. for $73 million has been called off in the wake of an unfavorable arbitrator's ruling regarding Gannett's plan not to honor an existing union contract at one of the papers. Tribune announced in March that it had agreed to sell the Advocate in Stamford and the Greenwich Time to Gannett, which is based in McLean, Va. Nearly 40 of the editorial employees at the Advocate are represented by the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America union; when Gannett said it did not plan to honor the contract with the unionized reporters and photographers, the workers got a federal judge to temporarily block the sale of the operations, pending an arbitrator's ruling. Last month, the arbitrator ruled that Tribune couldn't sell the company unless the buyer agreed to assume the existing union contract as a condition of the sale. Gannett declined to do so, however, and on Friday the two companies announced the deal had been terminated. Tribune, which is in the process of going private through a heavily leveraged $8.2 billion transaction, said it will "immediately" begin soliciting new offers for the two newspapers. Tribune owns the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, WGN-Ch. 9 and other media properties. Norwich soldier dies in helicopter crash in Iraq NORWICH &#151; The month of May is ending as the deadliest month of the year for U.S. troops in Iraq. That grim reality hit home for a Norwich family, who learned their son was killed when his helicopter crashed on Memorial day. Army 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman, 24, was the 37th military member with Connecticut ties to die since the war began in 2002. Two Connecticut civilians have also been killed. "It's all a shock to us," said Chris Heidtman, the soldier's uncle. Heidtman was one of 10 U.S. soldiers who died in roadside bombings and the helicopter crash on Monday, the military reported. As of late Tuesday, there were at least 113 U.S. deaths in Iraq so far in May, with two days left in the month. Eight of the soldiers were from Task Force Lightning &#151; six killed when explosions hit near their vehicles and two in a helicopter crash. The military did not say if the helicopter was shot down or had mechanical problems. Heidtman was a 2001 graduate of Norwich Free Academy and a graduate of the University of Connecticut. His parents were notified Tuesday morning. He was the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux. His stepfather is Art Robidoux. "If you had to pick your son, this is who you would pick. He was handsome, he was bright," Chris Heidtman said. Heidtman arrived in Iraq in December and was scheduled to come home for leave in July. "We're sending our finest, and we're losing them," Chris Heidtman said. Gov. M. Jodi Rell ordered all state and U.S. flags lowered to half staff in Heidtman's honor. "Lt. Heidtman made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, and he did so to protect the freedom that we so often take for granted," Rell said in a statement. "To have given his life on Memorial Day is especially poignant." Funeral arrangements have not been announced. Mail to a friend

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/13-2&fd=R&url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/washington/30immig.html%3Fhp&cid=1116783089&ei=jv1eRvLfMoey0AGI75nMDQ Bush Takes On Conservatives Over Immigration - New York Times Bush Takes On Conservatives Over Immigration Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 30, 2007 GLYNCO, Ga., May 29  President Bush took on parts of his conservative base on Tuesday by accusing opponents of his proposed measure of fear-mongering to defeat its passage in Congress. Skip to next paragraph President Bush spoke at a training center for border enforcement agents located in Glynco, Ga., on Tuesday. U.S. Raising Visa Fees 66% on Average, to Advocates Dismay Overhaul of Immigration Law Could Reshape New York If you want to scare the American people, what you say is the bills an amnesty bill, Mr. Bush said at a training center for customs protection agents and other federal agents here in southeastern Georgia. Thats empty political rhetoric trying to frighten our citizens. It was some of Mr. Bushs toughest language as he started an intensified effort to build support for the compromise bill in the Senate. The measure hews to Mr. Bushs long-sought goal of a new system with a path to citizenship for 12 million illegal immigrants, a guest-worker program for noncitizens and tighter borders. The compromise, which leaders of both parties struck almost two weeks ago, has met stiff resistance from the left and right of both parties. Liberals tend to oppose the section that would add emphasis on admitting immigrants with education and job skills and less on family reunification. Conservatives tend to dismiss the plan as an amnesty bill. It was the conservative opponents to whom Mr. Bush seemed to speak most forcefully here. If you want to kill the bill, he said, if you dont want to do whats right for America, you can pick one little aspect out of it. You can use it to frighten people. A senior official said later, In no way was he questioning anyones patriotism or desire to do whats right. It was a rare case of the presidents taking on the coalition that helped him win and keep the Oval Office, the same conservative radio hosts, bloggers, writers and members of Congress who contributed significantly to the defeat of immigration measures last year. Mr. Bush spoke at a critical time, as lawmakers return home to hear from constituents on a 10-day break. In the late spring recess last year, grass-roots opponents of an immigration bill barraged their representatives with complaints that it would amount to amnesty for lawbreakers, effectively killing its chance for passage. Unlike the circumstances last year, when the White House was willing to put party unity above a controversial presidential initiative in an election year, Mr. Bush is determined to head off a similar result this time. Lawmakers already saw echoes of last year. In California, two conservative talk show hosts urged listeners to bombard the telephone lines of Senator , a Democrat, to register their opposition. In South Carolina, Senator Jim DeMint, critic of the proposal, said that on a walk in downtown Spartanburg and lunch with more than 100 people at Wades restaurant on Tuesday he was hard pressed to find anyone who backed the Senate plan. Concern centered on whether promised enforcement would materialize, Mr. DeMint said. This is not playing well in South Carolina, he said. But like the president, business groups, advocates for immigrants, and religious and civil rights organizations urged Congress to keep working to shape a comprehensive immigration bill. In Phoenix, the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry praised the bill and said it provides the proper framework for restructuring the flawed U.S. immigration system. The chief Republican architect of the bill, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, has been criticized by some in his state party who object to offering legal status to illegal immigrants. Glenn E. Hamer, president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, praised Mr. Kyl as demonstrating tremendous leadership on this critical issue. Mr. Hamer said a spokesman for his organization conveyed this message on Spanish-language radio and television stations: The Senate bill has all the necessary ingredients. Its a huge step forward. An umbrella group, the Coalition for Comprehensive Immigration Reform, reached out this week to members of Congress in 23 states and urged them to act on the question. Congress has a historic opportunity to fix our immigration system and must not waste it, said Clarissa Martinez, campaign manager of the coalition, which is holding rallies and vigils, making telephone calls and sending letters and postcards to lawmakers. Ms. Martinez said her group, whose 43 members include the Center for Community Change, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the National Council of La Raza and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , sought substantial changes in the Senate bill to promote the reunification of families and to change the guest worker program so that temporary workers would not have to leave for 12 months between two-year stays. Mr. Bushs visit to the training center here was primarily meant to demonstrate that he has imposed strong measures to improve border security lapses, a problem that conservatives have loudly complained about. Now, he said, it is time to relieve pressure on the border by creating a rationalized system. People in Congress need the courage to go back to their districts and explain exactly what this bill is all about, Mr. Bush said. The fundamental question is will elected officials have the courage necessary to put a comprehensive immigration plan in place that makes it more likely we can enforce our border and, at the same time, uphold the great traditions of immigrant traditions of the United States of America? The address, given under a blazing sun before several hundred trainees and instructors, was his most direct attempt to brush back critics from both sides who the administration says have distorted the details of the bill. The appearance followed nearly two weeks in which officials have given dozens of interviews to radio hosts, editorial pages and newspapers pushing for the plan. Mr. Bush and his allies have faced an important rhetorical disadvantage, particularly from the right. Conservative opponents can use one word, amnesty, against the bill. Supporters, the president included, are forced into the complex weeds of policy and the nuances of legislative language. Mr. Bush tried to offset the difference by discrediting the amnesty accusation. Amnesty is forgiveness for being here without any penalties, Mr. Bush said. Thats what amnesty is. I oppose it. The authors, many of the authors, of this bill oppose it. This bill is not an amnesty bill. Under the Senate bill, illegal immigrants who want to become citizens would have to pay back taxes and pay thousands of dollars in fines.

Rick Perry, who now gets his turn at proposed laws, said Tuesday the just-ended legislative session produced mixed results for Texans who still may be shuddering at lawmakers' discord. "If Texans had a bad taste in their mouth from this session, I would say that I couldn't blame them &#8212; not because progress wasn't made, but because there was way too much acrimony," Perry said the day after the end of the session, whose results he likened to the movie "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." Perry praised lawmakers' work on several fronts, such as providing more financial aid for college students and funds to allow promised local school property tax relief. But he criticized them for not giving more tax relief, since they had billions in new dollars available. He wouldn't say whether he'll call lawmakers back into a special session before their next regular session in 2009. He still must wade through legislation, he noted, including the $152.5 billion state budget, and decide whether to sign, veto or allow bills to become law without his signature. But he indicated legislators need some time away. "I'm glad legislators are leaving town so that there is time for the wounds to heal," Perry said. The GOP governor had his share of policy scuffles, from lawmakers' decision to overturn his order for girls to be vaccinated against the virus that can cause cervical cancer to disagreements over transportation and budget issues that led to changes in legislation. But those disputes were overshadowed at session's end by a Senate battle over a voter identification bill and the failed, sometimes surreal effort in the House to oust GOP Speaker Tom Craddick that included a Democrat quoting Humpty Dumpty from a Lewis Carroll tale. Despite the interruptions and distractions, lawmakers passed 1,480 bills, according to the Legislative Reference Library, and most still await Perry's decision. Chief among them is the budget, which is needed to fund state government programs from education to prisons to transportation to health care for the needy. Lawmakers delayed completing the plan as they sought to satisfy Perry's call for incentive funding for universities and for a format that would better allow him to exercise his line-item veto power. Perry, while finding its priorities good, contended the budget "continues to erode a governor's constitutional line-item veto authority" and includes some "higher education pork ... added to the budget in the last week of this session." Told of Perry's concerns, Appropriations Chairman Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, said: "I'm glad he wasn't a member of the House. I think he would have voted 'no.'" Chisum said the budget showed restraint, corrected funding deferrals from past years and paid for priorities. As for Perry's movie comparison, Chisum had a different take on what he described as a "crazy, crazy session." "Maybe like 'Spider-Man,'" Chisum said.

ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Giuliani works Peninsula crowd TOUGH TALK : HE ATTACKS CLINTON TAX PLAN Article Launched: 05/31/2007 01:34:05 AM PDT Edwards woos voters at Google Editorial: Presidential candidates should talk about more than our cash Presidential candidates seek support from ethnic networks BURLINGAME - A day after his 63rd birthday, Republican presidential front-runner Rudy Giuliani celebrated Wednesday at a Hyatt fundraiser, but not before blasting Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democrat leader, for "looking toward the past." "I think the way a Republican should run is toward the future," the former New York City mayor told reporters at the Broadway Grill, where he signed autographs and chatted it up with customers. He criticized Clinton's proposal - which she pitched Tuesday in New Hampshire - to let President Bush's tax cuts for top earners expire. He supports eliminating the estate tax and reducing the capital gains tax. Playing to his audience, Giuliani said higher taxes would mean less venture capital for the high-technology industries that keep the Bay Area's economy afloat. There's "a dramatic difference ... between a philosophy of more government" espoused by Clinton and Democrat Barack Obama and his own support for "lower taxes, less government Giuliani then headed to a birthday-celebration fundraiser, heavy with Silicon Valley venture capitalists and corporate executives, at the Burlingame Hyatt. Tickets cost up to &#36;2,300, with the top price bringing a VIP reception and photo op with the candidate. From there, he was heading to a similar event in Beverly Hills. Nick Bovis, the owner of the downtown Burlingame eatery, presented Giuliani with an autographed photo of New York Yankee legend Joe DiMaggio. "We want you to redecorate the White House," Bovis told him. He signed a copy of the U.S. Constitution for local campaign coordinator Vic Marani, 47, of Santa Cruz, and accepted a &#36;200 campaign contribution check from George Yerby, 67, of Hillsborough; Giuliani quipped it might have been "the first time I think one's been given directly to me." Yerby, who said he's semi-retired from real estate, said Giuliani's policies are "perfect for this area. ... He's going to be the next president." After a slow circuit of the restaurant, Giuliani, with a cup of coffee in hand, took a seat between regulars Mike DeMaria and Nicholas Fleres, both of whom described themselves as "New York Italians." The conversation ranged from the Yankees to California's early primary to immigration policy. On the latter, Giuliani said he doesn't support the plan drawn up by the Senate and Bush, in part because it doesn't include issuing tamper-proof ID cards or require a database of all foreigners entering and leaving the country. Bob Mayer, 56, a self-employed wholesaler from Millbrae, said he supports Giuliani for precisely this reason. "It's not a time to quibble over abortion or to quibble about gay marriage," Mayer said. Immigration, border security and homeland security are paramount, he said. "Everything else is just window-dressing." On the way to his waiting car, Giuliani kissed the forehead of 11-month-old Daniel Caruso of Burlingame, whose mother, Lindsay Caruso, 30, said they had been out for a walk and stopped to see what all the hubbub was about. "I don't know a ton about him at this point," she said of Giuliani. "But I'm interested, definitely, and learning more." Contact Josh Richman at jrichman@angnewspapers.com or (510) 208-6428.

US lists fee hikes for new citizens Advocates blast dreaded increases By Yvonne Abraham, Globe Staff | US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced its long-awaited, and much-dreaded, schedule of fee increases yesterday. As of July 30, when the fee hikes go into effect, it will cost an individual $675 to file a citizenship application. The current fee is $400. The increases are expected to raise an extra $1 billion for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Department, which processes 6 million to 8 million applications each year, including those from immigrants seeking citizenship, legal permanent residency, or green cards; work authorizations; asylum petitions; and US citizen petitions to bring fianc&#xE9;es or adopted children into the country. The extra money will be used to cover existing costs, which outstrip revenues at the fee-based agency, and to improve services, spokesman Shawn Saucier said. But immigrant advocates across the country blasted the increases yesterday, saying they will put citizenship even farther out of reach for immigrants in low-wage jobs who are already struggling to pay the fees. "In spite of thousands of comments to the contrary, the Bush Administration moved forward to put another brick in the wall to citizenship," said Ali Noorani, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition. "There is no indication that services will improve, but fees are increasing. There are no changes to the system so that a person or a family can become citizens in a more efficient manner. It's still bureaucracy run amok. And now it's just a more expensive bureaucracy." Saucier countered that the fee increases are meant to make it faster and more efficient for immigrants to become citizens, not to add to their burdens. Currently, immigrants who file citizenship applications in Boston wait seven months for them to be processed. Saucier said the new revenues will be used to reduce waiting time by 20 percent by the end of fiscal 2008. "Obviously no one wants to pay more money, but it's an economic reality that the fees we charge right now do not cover our costs," he said. "We want to provide better services, and the advocates want to see better services, and the only way of raising resources is raising fees." Since announcing the proposed increases in February, CIS has received 3,900 comments, most of them objecting to the hikes. "We really did listen to the comments," Saucier said. As a result, fees for families and children applying for certain status adjustments have been reduced or eliminated, compared with those the department originally proposed, he said. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

On Zoelick's past performance it seems unlikely that he will be a typical tranzi as Wolfowitz's predecessors, John McCloy and James Wolfensohn (a close friend of former SecGen Kofi Annan's) were. At best, one can say that his immediate manners are smoother than those of Wolfowitz. Der Spiegel has an interesting and rather unhappy on the subject. Zoellick, they point out, is a man Germans know and like. Robert Zoellick will be the first World Bank president to take office already decorated with the Federal Cross of Merit, Germany's distinguished state honorary badge. His predecessors John McCloy and Jim Wolfensohn also received the Cross -- but only later. Zoellick already wears it, in recognition of his efforts to help bring about German reunification. As the main United States mediator in the "Two Plus Four Agreement" -- the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany that emerged from the 1990 talks between the two German states and the four World War II victors, and which led to German reunification -- he vigorously championed German self-determination. The Germans thanked him by awarding him the order. He is also a man who seems to believe strongly in free trade across the world. Certainly, he pushed many of the WTO agreements forward. So, everything in the garden is lovely? Sadly, no. It seems that Mr Zoellick puts America's interests first. I am shocked, I tell you, shocked. That a man employed by the United States government should put that country's interests first!!! Worse is to come. Robert Zoellick, it seems, is a long-standing friend of the Bush family and part of the very close political circle around both Bush Senior and Junior. When George W. Bush, then still the governor of Texas, set his sights on the White House, Zoellick was part of an intimate circle of advisors led by later National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. They called themselves "the Vulcans" and they sought to transform him into a man of the world. Gulp and double gulp. The President nominates someone who is close to him politically and personally and has also a formidable track-record in international negotiations. This just proves it. Not sure what it proves but it proves something. In case the Europeans who managed to get Wolfowitz out (notably it was not the Asian or African members of the World Bank who hatched or even took part in the plot) should relax, Der Spiegel has this to say: Zoellick is "moderate" only by comparison to Wolfowitz and his former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith, a classic neoconservative, writes Tom Barry, the director of the left-leaning International Relations Center. Zoellick himself accepts the "the neoconservative premise of US global supremacy" but wants to "wisely manage that power," according to Barry. He's not an ideologist, then, but an idealist: As early as one year before George W. Bush took office in January of 2001, Zoellick articulated his ideas about a "Republican foreign policy" in an essay for Foreign Affairs. The United States would shape the future world order on the basis of its military supremacy, Zoellick wrote, predicting the events of the years to come. "A modern Republican foreign policy," he wrote, "recognizes that there is still evil in the world." Bush himself couldn't have said it better. In other words, the left does not like him but he seems to appeal to others in the US, whether they are Bush supporters or not. To me, that is quite a good recommendation. His tough love approach to the EU over Airbus and sundry other matters is also something in his favour. Meanwhile, Irwin Stelzer views the issue from a slightly different in the Daily Telegraph. In his opinion, the Europeans, led by the Germans, ably supported by our own Hilary Benn, himself involved in some doubtful financial activity (but that's OK, chaps, he is one of us, i.e. nuanced), may well regret their Pyrrhic victory. They did not achieve what they really wanted, which is a non-American as President of the World Bank because it was made clear to Bush by the people who matter, his American supporters that this was out of the question. As Pyrrhic victories go, this one is top of the list. For one thing, George W. Bush heard in no uncertain terms from his supporters that they would raise a fuss if he appointed a non-American, even the respected Afghanistan central banker Ashraf Ghani, who holds both Afghan and US citizenship. For another, to sacrifice the wounded Mr Wolfowitz is one thing; to sacrifice the perk that goes along with being the largest single contributor to the World Bank, with no concessions in return, is quite another. One did not have to be a Bush supporter or a Wolfowitz admirer to feel disturbed, not to say nauseated, by the proceedings whereby the latter was got rid of. In other words, American opinion on the matter became more united, give or take a few out and out left-wing Democrats and nutroots, whose hatred of Bush and everyone around him overcomes everything. This may lead to what Europeans, in their hearts of hearts, fear most of all: a slow American disengagement from all these transnational organizations. What Mr Stelzer does not postulate is that there might be a much faster disengagement from Europe and matters European. That, I am sad to say, will include Britain. It would not have escaped anybody's attention that of the developed countries only Japan supported Wolfowitz throughout the whole mess. (Of course, the actual countries to whom his fight against corruption matters, also supported him but that is another story.) Britain, on the hand, was among the leaders of the pack. There is, Mr Stelzer thinks, a slow realignment in American attitude to the rest of the world. This has been said before, as one or two of the sillier responses to the article point out, but never with so much force. The Europeans' partial victory is going to come at a very high cost. Americans, and not only the neo-cons so reviled by the elite in Europe's capitals, are beginning to wonder about the usefulness of their commitment to many international institutions: "These institutions need to be rethought and restructured," said Bob Rubin, Bill Clinton's highly regarded treasury secretary. The fight over Mr Wolfowitz made Americans notice that they are squandering billions on armies of bureaucrats who think it a good idea to wreak vengeance on a man who shaped official US foreign policy, and a man who had as his central goal the elimination of corruption at the bank and among its client states. Then there is the World Trade Organisation. The Democratic Congress has decided that the costs of ever-freer trade are too high to make the game worth the candle, and is preparing legislation that will end in tariffs on Chinese imports, restrictions on purchases from countries that do not meet US-determined labour and environmental standards, and the likely death of the Doha round of trade talks. What of the other organizations? Then there is the UN, an organisation that recently decided that Zimbabwe is just the country to put in the chair of its sustainable economic development committee. With an inflation rate of 2,200 per cent, rampant starvation and a bankrupt government, Zimbabwe's UN representative, who would not be in the job were he not a supporter of Robert Mugabe, can't have very much to teach America - or anyone else. Besides, even those Americans who are unenthusiastic about Iraq, and want to see Mr Bush back in Texas clearing brush on his ranch, were offended when the UN provided the platform for Venezuela's Hugo Chávez to rant at Mr Bush, as "the devil" trailing a smell of sulphur. There is a mounting feeling that money spent to support the UN - its reputation already seriously dented by the oil-for-food scandal, its members devoted to embarrassing America and Israel while forgiving Arab nations all their sins - might not be in America's long-term interests. Perhaps of most significance is a growing realisation in Washington that Nato is past its sell-by date. As America takes mounting casualties in Afghanistan, EU countries, with Britain the notable and honourable exception, refuse to provide significant support for an effort in which they agreed to participate. The handful of German troops are not allowed out of their barracks after dark, and soldiers from other nations patrol the most peaceful regions of that violent country. Besides, Americans are increasingly aware that Europe is funding its generous welfare states by stinting on military spending, something they can do because they rely on American-funded Nato "assets" such as transport planes. That makes America, stung by its experience in Iraq, more rather than less likely to cut back on its role as world policeman. Perhaps the best early clue to emerging attitudes towards international organisations was Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's decision not to attend the recent meeting of G8 foreign ministers. He simply had more important things to do than to sit through sessions that could not possibly have tangible results. Mr Paulson's German counterpart agreed with the Treasury Secretary's priorities, and sent a deputy rather than postpone his own holiday. Will all those who revile American arrogance be all that happy with that outcome? It would, however, be one of history's supreme ironies that the slow destruction of tranzis will have been started by the arrogant and seemingly completely victorious activity of their greatest promoters.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Jury Selection in Old Miss. Murder By EMILY WAGSTER PETTUS Wednesday, May 30, 2007; 6:32 PM JACKSON, Miss. -- The first day of jury selection in the case of a reputed Ku Klux Klansman charged in the 1964 deaths of two young black men brought a Faulknerian cast of characters to a federal courtroom Wednesday. Mississippi's rural roots and modern anxieties were on display as the judge and lawyers winnowed the pool to 55 people, from which lawyers hope to pick a dozen to decide whether James Ford Seale, now 71, took part in abducting and killing Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee. The two 19-year-olds were beaten and dumped, still alive, into the Mississippi River.

Seale is charged with kidnapping and conspiracy charges connected to the 1964 slayings of the black teenagers in southwest Mississippi. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) (Rogelio V. Solis - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article Seale, who has denied membership in the Klan, faces up to life in prison if convicted of kidnapping and conspiracy in the latest of more than a dozen civil rights-era cases that have been prosecuted across the South since the early 1990s. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate is keeping jurors' names a secret at the request of prosecutors who said some might fear to serve in a case involving the Klan. One potential juror from rural southwest Mississippi said one of her cousins is married to one of Seale's cousins. "That makes me nervous, even though I don't know him personally," the woman said nodding toward Seale. Among the 20 other people dismissed from the initial group of 76 potential jurors were a one-armed chicken grower who said he needs to tend to his poultry to pay his bills, and a young woman in a Confederate battle flag T-shirt. Seale, having changed out of his orange jail jumpsuit into khaki pants and a light blue dress shirt, listened quietly in court through wishbone-shaped earphones to amplify the sound because of his hearing problems. When he left, his jail jumpsuit was topped by a bullet-resistant vest. He faces potentially damaging testimony from a man also charged back in 1964. Moore and Dee were hitchhiking May 2, 1964, when carloads of Klansmen were chasing rumors of a possible armed insurrection by black people in the area. The two were driven to the Homochitto National Forest and beaten, then stuffed into a trunk and driven more than 70 miles to the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, according to court records. They were weighted down with engine parts and dumped into the Mississippi, still breathing. Their bodies were found about two months later, when authorities were conducting an intenstive search for slain civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, who disappeared from central Mississippi's Neshoba County on June 21, 1964.

Tinsley Democratic ally says he will seek Craddick's post AUSTIN -- Another close ally of embattled House Speaker Tom Craddick, R-Midland, has announced his own bid for the powerful job. And this time it's a Democrat. Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Houston, was elevated to the No. 2 spot in the House leadership -- speaker pro tempore -- when Craddick came to power in 2003. Turner is one of several members of the Democratic minority who have helped Craddick stay at the helm. But that job got much harder last weekend when a rebellion against Craddick morphed into a full-blown mutiny. And now Turner, after repeatedly defending Craddick's claim to "absolute" power to stop the insurgency, said Wednesday that he wants to be speaker himself and presented himself as a peacemaker. "I don't ever want to have another legislative session like the one just completed," Turner said in a statement. "The people's business took a back seat to political agendas." The 140-day legislative session ended Monday, but a potentially brutal campaign season has just begun. The outcome of state House races could determine whether Craddick will stay in the race to be speaker in 2009 during the next legislative session. Rep. Warren Chisum, chairman of the powerful House budget-writing committee, said he expects Craddick to be active during the 2008 elections and seek early support for another two-year term as speaker. He was unclear beyond that. "He's pretty resilient," said Chisum, R-Pampa, who spoke at a news conference in Mesquite on Wednesday. "I suspect he'll run a tough campaign to be speaker again." But Chisum said he didn't know whether Craddick, who has filed the required paperwork, would actually go through with it. Chisum told reporters that he has not discussed the issue with the speaker. At least five Republicans are running for speaker. Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, previously announced a run, but Turner is the first "Craddick D" -- or a Democrat on the speaker's leadership team -- to jump in. Many analysts predict that the bitterness and conflict of the session will lead to electoral upheaval in 2008. Turner did not return phone calls from the Some are already suggesting that his bid may be more about his re-election campaign than a genuine effort to become speaker. Many of the Democrats who joined Craddick's team, including former Rep. Glenn Lewis of Fort Worth, have paid for it with their careers, losing to other Democrats who said they sold out. "It is protectionism," said Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, describing Turner's move. "This is definitely a proactive offense for Sylvester in his district. Many of the 'Craddick D's' will be opposed by real D's." Craddick, the longest-serving member of the Legislature, was chosen as speaker in 2003. That was the year the GOP took the House for the first time since the Civil War era. But after presiding over several years of bruising policy battles and personal conflicts, Craddick, known for iron-fisted rule, drew a challenge from fellow Republicans in January. He prevailed, but the insurgents wouldn't give up. A messy fight turned into a chaotic mutiny last weekend. After Craddick asserted complete authority to remain in power, two top aides quit and more loyalists defected. Yet Craddick was still on his feet when the gavel came down, and now there is talk of punishing the traitors. A new political organization, called We Won't Forget PAC, has been organized for that purpose. Republican Jon Taylor, a political scientist at the University of St. Thomas in Houston, said the Republicans could "easily lose the House" as a result of the bitter infighting. The GOP has an 81-69 majority in the House. Although lawmakers enacted significant reforms, the speaker drama dominated the session, which began in January. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the Republican who presides over the Senate, told Capitol reporters that he and several senators were glued to their laptops, watching streaming video of the shenanigans in the House during the session's final days. He likened the events to a reality TV show "for political junkies." Dewhurst called the political assaults on Craddick "unsettling," but he declined to comment directly on the speaker's handling of the ordeal. Asked whether he, as the Senate's presiding officer, could claim the same absolute power to control who could be recognized to speak, Dewhurst chose his words carefully. "I don't know that you have ever heard me say in three regular [legislative] sessions and four special sessions that I had an unappealable right not to recognize someone," he said.

The blue chip company has allegedly been involved with the Central Intelligence Agency with âthe forced disappearance, torture and inhumane treatmentâ of three men suspected of being terrorists. According to the suit, âPublicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standardsâ. The three men on behalf of whom the suit was brought includes Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian, who was allegedly mistreated in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and subjected to torture in May 2002 and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian who, while seeking asylum in Sweden was arrested by Swedish police and handed over to the CIA, underwent torture in December 2001. While Mohamed is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Britel is being held in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt. Mike pound, a spokesperson for Jeppesen has said, âThere isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for themâ. Boeingâs representative Timothy Neale has commented, âWe have not gotten the lawsuit yet, so we are not commenting on it. We are not confirming the reports that Jeppesen did work for the CIA. The services Jeppesen provides are provided on a confidential basis for all its customers.â The suit alleges that the detainees were taken to countries where they underwent inhumane, degrading treatment and torture since they were beyond the reach of the law. The suit also states that Jeppesen provided services to the flight and crew used in the rendition program âto unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistanâ. The suspects were apprehended under the U.S. government's âextraordinary rendition programâ. Extraordinary rendition is the clandestine capture and transfer of suspects to be detained and interrogated in countries where the protection of U.S. laws does not apply, said Ben Wizner, an ACLU attorney. He also said that âEither they knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program.â The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

See a photo you want? Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Thu, May. 31, 2007 Justice is widening its probe to other hirings WASHINGTON - An internal Justice Department investigation into the firing of eight federal prosecutors has broadened to examine whether the department used political considerations in hiring career employees for its Civil Rights Division. Glenn Fine, the department&#0039;s inspector general, and H. Marshall Jarrett, head of the Office of Professional Responsibility, told the House and Senate Judiciary Committees in a letter yesterday that the review also would focus on hiring for the department&#0039;s honors program for entry-level attorneys and on summer internships. The expansion followed the May 23 acknowledgment by the department&#0039;s former White House liaison, Monica Goodling, that she had "crossed the line" by inquiring into the party affiliations of people applying for nonpolitical jobs. Fine and Jarrett said they were looking at "allegations regarding Goodling&#0039;s and others&#0039; actions" in hiring and personnel decisions. The Justice Department began investigating in March to assess whether the U.S. attorneys had been fired for improper reasons, such as a way to meddle in cases, and whether department officials had misled Congress when testifying. Both Judiciary Committees are also probing the firings and the White House&#0039;s role in them. On May 2, the Justice Department disclosed that investigators also would probe whether Goodling had relied on improper political considerations in reviewing the applications of people seeking to become assistant U.S. attorneys. Last year&#0039;s firings touched off a political furor over Attorney General Alberto Gonzales&#0039; management of the department and his close ties to President Bush. Many Democrats and several Republicans have called for Gonzales&#0039; ouster, although Bush has repeatedly expressed support for him. Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D., Vt.) said in a statement that he welcomed the expanded review. Goodling, who quit in April, told the House Judiciary Committee under a grant of limited immunity that she sometimes considered lawyers&#0039; political views when reviewing them for positions as immigration judges or assistant U.S. attorneys. Both jobs are covered by civil-service laws barring such assessments.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18922846/&cid Little action follows New Orleans tower plans - U.S. Business - MSNBC.com Little action follows New Orleans tower plans Aside from proposed Trump Tower, construction has stalled on high-rises Bill Haber / AP A giant poster marks the proposed site where the Trump Tower is to be built in downtown New Orleans. NEW ORLEANS - Lured by congressionally authorized tax credits and other financial incentives after Hurricane Katrina, a procession of developers announced plans to build high-rises. But 20 months after the storm, most have fallen by the wayside. The slow pace of the recovery gets much of the blame. New Orleans still has no comprehensive rebuilding blueprint, and funding is falling far short of plannersâ expectations. Adding to the tension for commercial investors: Construction and insurance costs have soared. âThere have been a lot of announcements, but you donât see a lot of cranes, do you?â said Michael Siegel, executive vice president of Corporate Realty Inc., a New Orleans-based brokerage. âI think we all underestimated how long this (the recovery) was going to take.â At least one big plan â a $400 million proposal by Donald Trump to construct the cityâs tallest building â is going ahead, although the only visible sign at the planned site of the Trump International Hotel & Tower is the tycoonâs name painted on a brick-wall mural. Every weekday morning, cars fill the parking lot where the 70-story building is to be built. Not to worry, said Trumpâs son, Donald Jr. The cityâs slow recovery, he said, hasnât derailed the plan to build more than 700 units of condos and hotel rooms in the cityâs central business district. A sales office is expected to open near the site in less than three months, he said. But while the Trump proposal is making its way through the city approval process, most other projects have seen more hype than hard hats. Many have stalled or fallen apart. David da Cunha, president of the commercial investment division for the New Orleans Metropolitan Association of Realtors, said many developers are waiting for government leaders to devise a clear rebuilding plan before they invest. âI think thatâs what is slowing things down,â he said. Redevelopment proposals are making their way through the city approval process, and the cityâs recovery director, Ed Blakely, hopes the pace of reconstruction will pick up by fall. Blakely envisions a $1 billion program of mixed-use redevelopment, but his funding source â the federal government â has only $117 million available for the task. Doubts about the strength of the cityâs flood protection system also are weighing on developersâ minds, said city planning administrator Arlen Brunson. When Katrina struck on Aug. 29, 2005, levees broke and flooded about 80 percent of New Orleans. The water extended well into the business district, and hurricane-force winds blew out windows in many high-rises. The Army Corps of Engineers is pumping billions of dollars into flood protection improvements. But the Corps itself acknowledges some levees are not up to federally mandated standards set before Katrina. The Trumps, at least, have not been deterred. âThis is going to be a big statement for the city and its recovery,â Donald Trump Jr. said recently. âItâs not charity, but we do think itâs one of Americaâs great cities and we want to be there to support it any way we can.â The Trump project is one of eight new luxury condo complexes, totaling more than 8,000 units, approved by the city planning commission since Katrina. At least one of those projects, Vantage Tower, has fallen apart. In January 2006, Trey Cefalu announced plans to build the 25-story condo complex in the central business district. Prospective buyers reserved 105 of 219 units at Vantage Tower, but about half of them backed out after the developers raised prices to offset a 30 percent increase in construction costs. Cefalu said he decided to shelve Vantage Tower in February.

Lewis "Scooter" Libby &laquo; AMT Overhaul Schedule Slips The Scales Of Justice &raquo; Bush Sets New Global Strategy On Climate Change The White House has announced a new long-term, international strategy for combating climate change ahead of next week's Group of Eight summit in Germany. The plan, which was to unveil in a speech today, calls for global economic powers to band together and set shared targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. released prior to the president's speech, "the U.S. strategy calls for consensus on long-term goals for reducing the greenhouse gases that spur global warming, but not before the end of 2008." also previewed the new plan this morning, noting that "the initiative... is likely to run into criticism among some environmentalists, who worry that Mr. Bush's separate dialogue among the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitters will tend to undermine broader United Nations negotiations that are just getting under way." U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change is seeking a more formal agreement among nations that would succeed the Kyoto Protocol when it expires in five years. A senior White House official told the that "the dialogue Mr. Bush envisions will actually strengthen the formal U.N. discussions, by solving the biggest impediments to a deal, namely the lack of participation by emerging giants like China, India and Brazil, which aren't covered by Kyoto."

The blue chip company has allegedly been involved with the Central Intelligence Agency with âthe forced disappearance, torture and inhumane treatmentâ of three men suspected of being terrorists. According to the suit, âPublicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standardsâ. The three men on behalf of whom the suit was brought includes Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian, who was allegedly mistreated in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and subjected to torture in May 2002 and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian who, while seeking asylum in Sweden was arrested by Swedish police and handed over to the CIA, underwent torture in December 2001. While Mohamed is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Britel is being held in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt. Mike pound, a spokesperson for Jeppesen has said, âThere isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for themâ. Boeingâs representative Timothy Neale has commented, âWe have not gotten the lawsuit yet, so we are not commenting on it. We are not confirming the reports that Jeppesen did work for the CIA. The services Jeppesen provides are provided on a confidential basis for all its customers.â The suit alleges that the detainees were taken to countries where they underwent inhumane, degrading treatment and torture since they were beyond the reach of the law. The suit also states that Jeppesen provided services to the flight and crew used in the rendition program âto unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistanâ. The suspects were apprehended under the U.S. government's âextraordinary rendition programâ. Extraordinary rendition is the clandestine capture and transfer of suspects to be detained and interrogated in countries where the protection of U.S. laws does not apply, said Ben Wizner, an ACLU attorney. He also said that âEither they knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program.â The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

As Council members took turns speaking on the issue, crowds booed, hissed and cheered, and the meeting was called to order several times. Adding to the drama, Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who is white, was chastised by Councilman Charles Barron, a Brooklyn Democrat and a former Black Panther, for her opposition to the measure. The Council voted down the measure 25-15, with seven abstentions. Staten Island's three-member contingent rejected the Carson street renaming. The tally broke down largely along racial lines, with only one vote to rename the street coming from a white member and all black members either voting for the renaming or abstaining. "This fairly innocuous bill, a street renaming ... sounds so innocuous, so routine, and yet now it's not that," said Councilman Albert Vann, a black Democrat from Bedford-Stuyvesant who spearheaded the measure. "You've hit a nerve. You're harking back to a time that we've already overcome. You're infringing upon our human right." Ms. Quinn, a Democrat, called Carson "divisive" in explaining her "no" vote. "If you look at the life and the full record of who Sonny Carson was, it was divisive. It is a record that is without apology. It is not a record which stood in full support and full solidarity for all New Yorkers of all races and religions," Ms. Quinn said, while the crowd fired jeers of "You didn't know him!" Carson, a Korean War veteran who died in 2002, led protests against police brutality, among other things. He was criticized for calling himself "anti-white," a quote Barron said was taken out of context by the media. Carson was arrested in 1974 on charges of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping -- prosecutors claimed he had ordered the revenge shootings of two men -- and convicted of kidnapping. Sentenced to seven years in prison, he served 15 months and became politically active following his release. Ms. Quinn, who is openly gay and is regarded as having liberal views, was on the end of a harangue by Barron and other black Council members. "You brought us to a place of divide that this City Council has never experienced," Barron said, often pointing a finger at her during his speech and refusing to stop when his two-minute time allotment ended.

Wearing a pinstripe suite and a cabana hat, Councilman Albert Vann, who represents District 36 in Bedford Stuyvesant, said renaming parts of Gates Avenue in Brooklyn to Sonny Abubadika Carson Avenue was an issue of self determination for the Black community. This is not just disrespect for Sonny Carson, its disrespect for the struggle of Black people. You are infringing upon our rights, Vann expressed. Supporters of the name change want Gates Avenue from Classon to Marcy Ave. to be renamed Sonny Abubadika Carson Avenue. The news conference was a spirited gospel of community activists, educators and elected officials all demanding in unison that a hero comes in different shades, genders and ideologies. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn withdrew Carsons name from the street naming ballot because she considered him anti-white and divisive. If you are going to sit here and tell me that Gates, Fulton and all of these slave holders and racists [can have a street] you need to shut up, Councilman Charles Barron yelled. Barron said Carson was the least divisive of the people commemorated with streets named after pervious slave owners, and that Carson deserves a street named after him. How many of you would want your life judge by a few words that you might have uttered in anger? Rev. Daughtry preached. No one, and therefore we want our life judged not only on a word but on the totality of everything. This city owes him a debt of gratitude instead of denying him as a hero. Back to Previous Page Email This Story to a Friend Click here for an Copyright 2007 All Rights Reserved :: Legal and Privacy Policy

Expands Internal Inquiry Justice Dept. Expands Internal Inquiry Ex-Aide Monica Goodling's Recent Testimony Prompts New Questions About DOJ Hiring and Firing Practices The Justice Department has expanded its investigation into the firing of eight U.S. attorneys after Monica Goodling's testimony last week. &#40;ABC News/AP Photo&#41; Wednesday the Department of Justice informed the House and Senate Judiciary Committees that it was expanding an internal investigation into the bungled firings of eight U.S. attorneys. The internal probe is being expanded after Monica Goodling, the former Justice Department White House liaison, testified to Congress earlier this month that she may have broken the law by using political considerations in hiring career officials. Internal Justice Investigation: News to Former Gonzales Aide Aide on Gonzales Chat: 'Uncomfortable' Democrats Grill Gonzales on Firings Gonzales Defends U.S. Attorney Firings, Resists Resignation Justice Morale Takes Hit as Gonzales Controversy Lingers Bush White House Pressured Justice Department for Terror Powers "We have expanded the scope of our investigation to include allegations regarding improper or other considerations in hiring decisions within the Department of Justice," wrote Glenn Fine, DOJ's inspector general, and Marshall Jarrett, chief of the Office of Professional Responsibility, to the chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Both the Inspector General's Office and the Office of Professional Responsibility serve as internal watchdogs for the department. 'I May Have Gone Too Far' Last week, Goodling testified before the House Judiciary Committee that she may have gone "too far" and inadvertently "crossed the line" in asking political questions of applicants for nonpolitical jobs at the Department of Justice. "I don't believe I intended to commit a crime," Goodling said in her appearance before the panel. "I do acknowledge that I may have gone too far in asking political questions of applicants for career positions, and I may have taken inappropriate political considerations into account on some occasions. And I regret those mistakes," the former aide to Gonzales said. Goodling took a leave of absence in March, as the political firestorm over the attorney dismissals began to grow. She stepped down permanently in April. The former aide had initially told Congress she would invoke her Fifth Amendment right and refuse to testify about her role in the controversial U.S. attorney firings but received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony. "Ms. Goodling's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee indicated that political litmus tests were administered to applicants for some career, nonpolitical positions within the department," House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., said in a statement Wednesday.

The page is still readable. [ Register now - free! Thursday, 31st May 2007 Wed 30 May 2007 Boeing unit sued over CIA flights NEW YORK (Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union is suing a Boeing Co. unit it accuses of helping the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency transfer foreign suspects to overseas prisons where it says they were held and tortured. The New York-based rights group said it would file a suit against Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. on Wednesday, charging that the company provided flight and logistical support to at least 15 aircraft on 70 so-called "rendition" flights. The suit, to be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, is being made on behalf of Binyam Mohamed, Abou Elkassim Britel and Ahmed Agiza, who the ACLU said were abducted by the CIA, detained and tortured. The complaint alleges Jeppesen organized flights over a four-year period to countries "it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted standards." "Extraordinary rendition should be condemned. It should not be seen as a source of corporate profit," Anthony Romero, ACLU executive director, told a news conference. A European Parliament-backed report found at least 1,245 CIA flights were made into or over Europe in the four years after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Washington acknowledges the secret transfer of suspects to third countries but denies torturing them or handing them over to countries that did. Jeppesen declined to comment on the ACLU suit, and would not say if the CIA was a customer. According to the ACLU, Jeppesen played a key role in what it called Washington's extraordinary rendition program, providing aircraft crew with itineraries, preparing flight plans, procuring landing permits from foreign governments and helping with customs clearance and ground transportation. Steven Watt, an ACLU attorney, said that without Jeppesen's services the rendition program could not have operated. "It's both illegal and immoral for a corporation to profit from kidnapping and torture and any corporation that knowingly does so must be held to account," he said. Romero warned other companies involved in a "program that is illegal and aids the government in the practices of torture" that they too are at risk of liability in U.S. courts. "There are a number of other corporations that are involved with such efforts, whether they are military contractors at Guantanamo or personnel services in Iraq," he said. The ACLU did not say whether it was considering further legal action. The suit claims Jeppesen knew the purpose of the rendition flights. It is to be filed under the Alien Tort Statute, which permits foreigners to bring claims in the United States for violations of the law of nations or a U.S. treaty. British resident Mohamed and Italian citizen Britel were separately arrested in Pakistan in 2002, while Egyptian citizen Agiza was apprehended in Sweden in 2001, the ACLU said. Mohamed is now held at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. military prison in Cuba, Britel was convicted and imprisoned in Morocco on terrorism-related charges, while Agiza was convicted and imprisoned in Egypt for being a member of a banned group. The ACLU also said on Wednesday it would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the dismissal of a lawsuit against former CIA Director George Tenet and 10 CIA employees by a German who says he was kidnapped and tortured by the agency. In March, a U.S. appeals court upheld the dismissal of the suit, brought by Khaled el-Masri, a German of Lebanese origin, after agreeing with government arguments that moving forward with the case would pose a risk of exposing state secrets.

Norwich soldier dies in helicopter crash in Iraq NORWICH [AP] &#151; A helicopter crash in Iraq on Memorial Day claimed the life of a Norwich soldier, the governor's office said Tuesday. Army 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman, 24, was the 37th military member with Connecticut ties to die since the war began in 2002. Two Connecticut civilians have also been killed. Gov. M. Jodi Rell ordered all state and U.S. flags lowered to half staff in Heidtman's honor. "Lt. Heidtman made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, and he did so to protect the freedom that we so often take for granted," Rell said in a statement. "To have given his life on Memorial Day is especially poignant." Heidtman was one of 10 U.S. soldiers who died in roadside bombings and the helicopter crash on Monday, the military reported, making May the deadliest month of the year for U.S. troops in Iraq. The American deaths raised the number of U.S. forces killed this month to at least 112, according to an Associated Press count assembled from U.S. military statements. Eight of the soldiers were from Task Force Lightning &#151; six killed when explosions hit near their vehicles and two in a helicopter crash. The military did not say if the helicopter was shot down or had mechanical problems. Heidtman was a 2001 graduate of Norwich Free Academy and a graduate of the University of Connecticut. His parents were notified Tuesday morning. He was the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux. His stepfather is Art Robidoux. A phone message from The Associated Press was left at his family's home. "If you had to pick your son, this is who you would pick. He was handsome, he was bright," Kerry Heidtman told The Day of New London. Heidtman arrived in Iraq in December and was scheduled to come home for leave in July. "We're sending our finest, and we're losing them," Kerry Heidtman said. Mail to a friend

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Death of Guantanamo Detainee Is Apparent Suicide, Military Says Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2007; Page A08 A Saudi detainee at the , was found dead in his cell from an apparent suicide yesterday afternoon, military officials said. He would be the fourth detainee to take his own life at the facility in the past year. Military officials at U.S. Southern Command did not release details about the death or identify the detainee, who was among about 80 Saudi Arabians in custody. Attorneys with the Center for Constitutional Rights, a -based law group that represents many Guantanamo detainees, said they had learned no details as of last night and did not have independent confirmation that the death was a suicide. In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article "The detainee was found unresponsive and not breathing in his cell by guards," military officials said in a news release on Southcom's Web site. "The detainee was pronounced dead by a physician after all lifesaving measures had been exhausted." Naval Criminal Investigative Service has started an investigation, and a cultural adviser is assisting officials at the base to ensure that the detainee's body is handled in a "culturally sensitive and religiously appropriate manner," according to the release. Three detainees committed suicide in their cells simultaneously on June 10, 2006, using clothes and sheets to fashion makeshift nooses. officials called the incident an act of "asymmetric warfare" and a way to garner negative publicity for the detention facility on the U.S. base. Those detainees, according to the military, allegedly conspired with others to carry out a suicide pact and passed notes among themselves about how to do it. The three suicides in June were the first detainee deaths reported at Guantanamo since it opened in January 2002. As of last year, there had been more than 40 suicide attempts by about 25 detainees, including some who had tried to overdose on hoarded drugs and one who repeatedly tried to die by hanging and slashing himself. Such cases are illustrative of the negative image that Guantanamo has internationally; even Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has expressed a desire to close the facility because of the taint it carries. Attorneys for detainees have talked emotionally about the desperation their clients feel and have railed against what they consider worsening conditions at the facility's newest camp, which is modeled after U.S. prisons. There are about 380 detainees at Guantanamo, fewer than half of the 775 detainees who have been there since it was opened to house those captured in the war in and in the larger Bush administration effort against terrorism. Three detainees have been charged with crimes under the Military Commissions Act of 2006. and at Guantanamo referred all inquiries to Southcom. A Southcom spokesman said last night that he could not elaborate on details of yesterday's death. Wells Dixon, an attorney at CCR, said last night that he has asked the for information about the detainee, and that his organization is already calling for an independent investigation into his death. Dixon, who visited Saudi detainees at Guantanamo earlier this month, said they "were suffering terribly." "The fact that four detainees have now died while in military custody should not surprise anyone," Dixon said. "These results are predictable, given the fact that these men have been confined for so long without charge or trial under such difficult circumstances."

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 CANAL POINT, Fla., May 30  This state seems to seesaw perpetually between crises related to water: either too much or too little. Skip to next paragraph Scott Fisher/South Florida Sun-Sentinel, via Associated Press Fire burning to western shore of Lake Okeechobee on Tuesday. Levels are falling about a half-inch a day. Wednesday was no exception, as the retreating waters of drought-sapped Lake Okeechobee, a vital reservoir for millions of residents in dry times, sank toward a new low. Signaling the intensity of this once-a-century drought, roiling smoke clouds rose from exposed stretches of the saucerlike 730-square-mile basin midway between the crowded coasts. The plumes came from wildfires sweeping a 12,000-acre stretch of lakebed exposed as the waters retreated and sank about half an inch a day, water officials said. The flames fed on weeds and grasses that normally provide hiding places for bass, but are now baked by the sun and dehydrated by relentless winds. Officials at the South Florida Water Management District said the lake depth on Wednesday &#151; about six feet below normal &#151; matched the record low set in a long drought in 2001 and would certainly break the record overnight. This year is definitely a larger challenge than 2001, said Carol Wehle, executive director of the water district. We have drought all the way from Disney to Key West. Ms. Wehle said the easterly winds like those blowing over this town on the eastern shore of the lake were accelerating the drop in water by speeding evaporation. Add to that warmer temperatures and lots of sunshine and when it gets this dry it doesnt take much for the fire to spread, she said. Thunderstorms predicted for this week, even a hurricane or two, are unlikely to end the water woes, Ms. Wehle said. We need feet of rain, but coming every day throughout the summer, she said. When you have one big storm dumping a lot of water, the system cant catch it. More Articles in National &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Rudy Giuliani says he is the Republican Party's best shot at taking California. Giuliani's lead in the polls may soon change if, as expected, another prominent republican gets into the race. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani spent almost thirty minutes at Burlingame's Broadway Grill -- meeting and greeting supporters. The republican presidential candidate is pro-choice, pro-gun control something he clearly believes will help him, win over Californians. Rudy Giuliani, Presidential Hopeful: "I believe if I'm the candidate you'll be seeing a lot more campaigning in California because I think I'm the one Republican candidate who has a legitimate chance to win California." But Giuliani's moderate views may be the reason why Fred Thompson is on the verge of declaring his candidacy. Fred Thompson, Former Senator: "You wouldn't think you'd have to make the lower tax case again, but you have to make it every day in Washington D.C." GOP conservatives have been pushing the former Tennessee senator, and current Law and Order star to run for president. Just today, Thompson asked the producers of Law and Order to release him from the television show. Bill Whalen, Republican Strategist: "Well, what it means to me is that he's running." Bill Whalen is a republican strategist and a fellow at the Hoover Institution. Bill Whalen: "Right now he has been a concept. And now he's becoming a Republican, and he's a very lofty concept to Republicans, why? Because he has this Reaganesque communications qulaity that people talk about. He's an actor, he's this wonderful persona in movies and TV. Republicans look at that and think. Aha." According to a CBS/New York Times Poll, Republican voters are hungry for a new candidate. Only 38-percent said they were satisfied with the republican candidates now running for president, while 57-percent said they would like to have more choices. Giuliani, who has been leading the polls among republican candidates so far, says he welcomes Thompson to the race. Rudy Giuliani: "I'm very comfortable with the idea that the Republican Party members get to decide who the candidate's going to be and they have a right to be exposed to all the possible different candidates that they are. I think Fred joining the race; will be a really good thing." Thompson is expected to launch a major fundraising drive next week, and could officially enter the race as early as July, at which time he'll likely face tough questions about his lack of legislative accomplishments, and about his past career as a lobbyist.

Fred Thompson plans to begin formally "testing the waters" for a Republican presidential run receives heavy coverage, with all three networks covering it -- two in depth -- and most major national newspapers putting the story on the front page. Coverage is generally sympathetic toward the new candidate, noting his Hollywood fame and his appeal to conservatives in the unsettled GOP race. Many reports mention Thompson's desire to evoke thoughts of an earlier actor-politician, Ronald Reagan. However, some stories have an undercurrent of doubt about, in ABC's words, Thompson's "lack of legislative accomplishments" during his Senate tenure. reported, "Ten Republicans are already running. How about number 11?" Thompson "lawyer, actor, former senator -- will file papers Monday to begin raising money, the first step toward candidacy. Thompson is expected to announce as early as the Fourth of July." ABC, noting his Hollywood career, added, "But playing a president is a lot easier than being one." In a 2,000-word front-page story, says Thompson "has been coy with audiences as he flirts with a bid," but in an interview with the newspaper, he "makes it clear that he plans to run, he describes how he aims to do it. He's planning a campaign that will use blogs, video posts and other Internet innovations to reach voters repelled by politics-as-usual in both parties." In his column, Robert Novak says Thompson suggested at a Tuesday dinner with "20 fellow conservatives, mostly journalists," that "his candidacy will be different from other Republicans, in both substance and style." Thompson "envisions a 21st-century campaign, using the Internet more and spending less than his opponents." , also on its front page, says Thompson's backers "hope his name recognition as an actor and radio commentator, conservative stands on issues like immigration and government spending, and strength in the South will differentiate him from the current crop of candidates." Under the perhaps inevitable headline "Thompson Prepares For Biggest Role Yet," the also says that as a "plain-spoken southern Republican with a solidly conservative voting record," Thompson "would hope to become the consensus candidate the party is so far lacking." says Thompson will position himself "as a down-home antidote to Washington politics" and will run his "campaign out of Nashville while promising leadership on a conservative agenda that will appeal to his party's base." The Post says his entry will add "a fourth candidate to the field's top tier," since Giuliani, McCain, and Romney "have struggled to win the confidence of conservative Republicans." But GOP strategists "cautioned that Thompson will need a more refined message and an error-free start to live up to the publicity surrounding his all-but-certain candidacy." The New Hampshire Union Leader also says "polls indicate he would start in the first tier of candidates." says Thompson "has been keeping a high profile in conservative circles and preparing behind the scenes to start a campaign. He has gathered a cadre of senior advisors that includes" former RNC political director Ken Rietz and former Federal Election Commission chairman Michael Toner. says Thompson "will have to move quickly to expand his support to catch up to his leading GOP rivals, in a race where several candidates are expected to raise as much as $100 million before the 2008 primaries." Effect On GOP Top-Tier Candidates Remains Unclear focused on "how this affects the already crowded field." NBC (Russert): "The Fred Thompson campaign senses an unease among the top Republican contenders amongst the conservative base, and that Thompson will try to cast himself as a consistent conservative and try to fill that vacuum." Giuliani's campaign "expects their candidate will take a hit initially in the polls that some of their supporters who gravitated Giuliani will go to Thompson, feeling more comfortable with his conservative credentials, but it will also unsettle the race. If you talk to the Mitt Romney people, it says he'll hurt John McCain because he supported John McCain in 2000. And they have to raise money from similar places. McCain says, no that's not the case, he'll hurt Romney, because Romney had got some momentum, particularly in Iowa, and this now shakes up the race and makes Romney look less conservative than Fred Thompson." says Thompson "is likely to cut into support for a prominent real-life ex-prosecutor, Rudolph Giuliani." While some analysts said Romney "has the most to lose if Thompson can pick up the conservative voters Romney is banking on," Giuliani "would suffer too if conservatives rally to Thompson's side and see in him what they have seen in the ex-mayor -- an electable candidate with the aura of celebrity." However, Giuliani backer Rep. Peter King said he "believes voters will see the difference between real life and TV when they are looking for a strong leader." King said, "Rudy had 9/11, and Fred Thompson had 'Law & Order.'" Thompson Likely To Be On Ames Straw Poll Ballot reports Thompson will probably be on Iowa's August 11 Ames straw poll ballot "whether he wants to be or not." While "some Thompson advisers are urging him not to contest the straw poll," the event "is run by the Iowa Republican Party, and the party's members, not the candidates, decide which contenders are listed." Obama, Romney Focus On Foreign Policy reports Sen. Barack Obama and Mitt Romney "outline their respective foreign policy visions in lengthy articles in the next issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, offering sharp contrasts on issues including the war in Iraq and climate change." Obama "calls the Bush administration's Iraq policies 'tragically misguided' and advocates a phased withdrawal of U.S. combat forces, to be completed by next March," while Romney "notes that there is 'no guarantee' that the administration's current strategy will succeed but says that 'the stakes are too high and the potential fallout too great to deny our military leaders and troops on the ground the resources and the time needed to give it an opportunity.'"

Hillary Clinton responded to the lawsuit brought by shareholders of InfoUSA against chief executive Vinod Gupta for allowing Clinton to travel aboard company planes by saying "that she followed all Senate rules" and that her acceptance of this travel did not negate her criticisms of "corporate America's largesse and skyrocketing executive pay." Calling Gupta a "longtime benefactor," the AP notes that "Clinton's campaign has said she reimbursed Gupta at the cost of a first-class flight, typically a significant discount off the expense of a private jet." Brownback Expands On Evolution Views op-ed called "What I Think About Evolution," Sen. Sam Brownback writes, "I suppose I should not have been surprised earlier this month when, during the first Republican presidential debate, the candidates on stage were asked to raise their hands if they did not 'believe' in evolution. As one of those who raised his hand, I think it would be helpful to discuss the issue in a bit more detail and with the seriousness it demands. The premise behind the question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly assert belief in evolution, then one must necessarily believe that God created the world and everything in it in six 24-hour days. But limiting this question to a stark choice between evolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity of the interaction between science, faith and reason." Tancredo Has "Cult Following" profiles "Rep. Tom Tancredo: A Lightning Rod On Immigration." The Tribune says Tancredo's "crusade to have every illegal immigrant in the country deported and to make English the country's official language has inspired a cult following for this grandson of Italian immigrants, attracting white supremacists and PTA moms alike." While his presidential bid "is widely regarded as a long shot, the reaction he has received so far in Iowa shows his campaign can't be entirely dismissed, political analysts say." FEC: Kerry Violated Spending Limits reports a Federal Election Commission draft audit says Sen. John Kerry's publicly funded 2004 presidential campaign "broke spending limits by nearly $1.4 million during his 2004 presidential bid, including some funds spent on customizing his campaign jets." The FEC "could rule that Kerry's campaign must reimburse the government." says Kerry-Edwards lawyer Marc Elias "says the campaign stayed within the limits and accused the commission's auditors of taking 'an unsupportably aggressive view of the law.'" to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Bush Sees Korea When He Looks At Iraq The White House on Wednesday offered the US military mission in South Korea as a model for its role in Iraq. The suggestion drew skeptical treatment from the media, as well as renewed questions about the success of the Iraq troop "surge." The reports White House press secretary Tony Snow "told reporters that" President Bush "believes US forces eventually will end their combat role in Iraq but will continue to be needed in the country to deter threats and to help handle potential crises, as they have done in South Korea." The reports the comparison between Iraq and South Korea "was offered as the Pentagon announced the completion of the troop buildup ordered by Bush in January. The last of about 21,500 combat troops to arrive were an Army brigade in Baghdad and a Marine unit heading into the Anbar province in western Iraq." runs a brief report on Snow's comments under the headline "Bush Sees Troops In Iraq For 'Long Time,'" while the portrays the new "model" as a consequence of the possible failure of the current "surge." A "resurgence of sectarian violence and attacks on US troops, coupled with little to no progress on crucial Iraqi political goals, is already spurring discussion about whether the current strategy can succeed." David Broder, in a column titled "Endgame Ahead," writes in the that "the end is coming into view -- not soon enough to spare every precious life, but sooner than President Bush and Vice President Cheney may wish. The dynamic in Congress has been set in motion that will bring this war to an end -- or at least reduce the scale of American involvement and redefine the mission of U.S. troops." Petraeus: Iraqis Must Take Opportunity interviewed Gen, David Petraeus, who said, "Everyone is impatient, including the Iraqi leaders. And what we have to see, now, is, in fact, whether they can make the most of this opportunity that our soldiers and their soldiers are fighting and dying to give to them." Maliki Warns Of Iraqi Army Coup Schemes interviewed Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, who said, "I have to watch the army because those still loyal to the previous regime may start planning coups. Those people don't believe in democracy and for that reason we are monitoring the status of the army very carefully." Bush Team Considers New Media Outreach Current and former Bush administration communications officials tell the US News Political Bulletin that they now believe they relied too heavily on traditional media and the White House press corps to get out the President's message about the broader war on terrorism and the booming economy. "We didn't use the new tools of communication" like the Internet, blogs and mobile technology, said a former key official. As a result, added another official, the President's message was filtered through the mainstream press which eventually got bored with the story and stopped reporting the President's repetitive messages. "You've got to use the new tools. They can reach far more people than TV or the papers," said an administration official. "A video on the Internet or some blogging can reach millions and we should have played with that much more," said the official. White House insiders, however, dismissed the complaints, mostly from former communications officials, claiming that they have worked with bloggers and non-traditional media but that the tide has turned against them. The White House lessons are being played out on the 2008 presidential campaign where several former Bush aides are working for GOP candidates who are relying more on Internet and blog-based communications than the traditional TV ads and national press corps. "We've got to learn to communicate in a different way," said an advisor to likely GOP candidate Fred Thompson. DOJ Probe: The Plot Thickens After Monica Goodling, a former Justice Department aide, testified last week that she "crossed the line" by using political affiliation as a criteria for hiring decisions, the DOJ inspector general and other ethics officials have expanded their investigation. reports Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine and Counsel Marshall Jarrett of the Office of Professional Responsibility, "which investigates misconduct within the agency, sent a letter to Congress on Wednesday saying they are also looking into the program for hiring entry-level lawyers and summer interns." The says the "expanded investigation also appears to reflect concerns among a growing number of career employees at the Justice Department who have suggested that politics have compromised the hiring process at the department during the Bush administration." And the says the "widening inquiry is likely to pose an additional challenge for Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales." While the US attorney "dismissals have prompted wide political criticism, improper hiring practices could be deemed a violation of the law." reports it "couldn't be determined whether the Goodling inquiry will be expanded to include what direction she received from higher-ups within the department or the White House. The announcement Wednesday, however, indicated that the internal inquiry is looking more broadly at charges of politicization across the department." The runs a similar report. Pattern Seen In Minnesota Case reports that by the time Minnesota US Attorney Tom Heffelfinger "resigned last year, his office had collected a string of awards and commendations from the Justice Department. So it came as a surprise -- and something of a mystery -- when he turned up on a list of U.S. attorneys who had been targeted for firing." But "part of the reason, government documents and other evidence suggest, is that he tried to protect voting rights for Native Americans." to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Bush AIDS Proposal Widely Praised In what has become a rare occurrence, a proposal by President Bush yesterday is earning praise from almost all corners. reported Bush "says he wants to double America's commitment to fighting AIDS in Africa." Bush is asking Congress "to authorize an additional $30 billion for his AIDS program over a period of five years." called Bush's proposed funding increase "dramatic." Under the headline "Bush AIDS Plan Gets Bipartisan Praise," the says Bush's proposal "was met yesterday with broad support uncommon in Washington. International aid organizations, advocacy groups and members of Congress from both parties offered praise for the proposal -- even if some argued that the proposed increase is insufficient." The notes Bush also "announced that his wife, Laura, will visit four African countries -- Zambia, Mali, Mozambique and Senegal -- that have benefited from the U.S. program and report back to him on her findings. The trip will take place June 25-29." says Bush's proposal "comes a week before he and other leaders will discuss AIDS and Africa at the Group of Eight summit of leading industrialized nations." Among the few who criticized Bush plan, says the , was Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, who "said the government should also boost spending on malaria and tuberculosis, and on related efforts that are not part of the program but could bolster the fight against HIV/AIDS, including education, nutrition, water, food security and healthcare workers." Praising Bush's announcement, meanwhile, was Bono. reports "the Grammy-winning rock star sang Bush's praises Wednesday" in a phone interview from Morocco. reports White House counselor Dan Bartlett "said the president was convinced America's image in the world would improve because" of initiatives like this one. Jenna Bush's Book On AIDS-Stricken Girl reports in its "Reliable Source" column that Bush twin Jenna "completes her transformation from party girl to global activist this weekend when she starts the promotional rounds for her book, 'Ana's Story: A Journey of Hope.'" Bush, 25, will "appear Saturday at N.Y.C.'s BookExpo America, meeting with booksellers to spike sales and generate buzz." A "peek at the 296-page advance manuscript shows a strong narrative as Bush traces the life of a 17-year-old Panamanian girl living with HIV-AIDS." Pay Discrimination Ruling Under Fire In the wake of the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to limit employees' ability to sue for pay discrimination, the says congressional Democrats have pledged to reverse the outcome of the case through legislation. The decision is also generating significant media criticism, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's outspoken dissent drawing positive media coverage. The reports that both in "the abortion case the court decided last month and the discrimination ruling it issued on Tuesday," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg "read forceful dissents from the bench." Ginsburg "may have concluded that quiet collegiality has proved futile and that her new colleagues, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., are not open to persuasion on the issues that matter most to her." says in an editorial, "The Supreme Court struck a blow for discrimination this week by stripping a key civil rights law of much of its potency. ... Fortunately, Congress can amend the law to undo this damaging decision. It should do so without delay." The writes "Ginsburg is clearly right on the policy: It's impossible for every victim of pay discrimination to know and take action within 180 days. Congress should adjust the law accordingly." And the editorializes that Ginsburg "attempted to call the court's attention to those real-world facts." Congress is "left to act because the Supreme Court has read the law so rigidly that it has misread life." to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. The Latest From Late Night Comedians The late-night political shows were reruns last night. to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Copyright &copy; 2007 by the Bulletin News Network, Inc. 7915 Jones Branch, Suite 6200 &bull; McLean, VA 22102 every weekday at 8 a.m. BEST CAREERS 2007 &raquo; Here's where &#151; and where not &#151; to look if you're considering a fresh career start in 2007.

Thompson, the former Tennessee senator and star of NBC's "Law & Order," will jump into the 2008 presidential race and start raising money next week, supporters and advisers said yesterday, delivering a jolt to a GOP field that some party activists and analysts believe lacks a viable conservative candidate. Thompson set to run, in jolt to GOP field Late entry poses challenges By Scott Helman, Globe Staff | Republican Fred D. Thompson, the former Tennessee senator and star of NBC's "Law & Order," will jump into the 2008 presidential race and start raising money next week, supporters and advisers said yesterday, delivering a jolt to a GOP field that some party activists and analysts believe lacks a viable conservative candidate. Thompson, who served eight years in the Senate until 2002, plans to establish a presidential exploratory committee in the next several days, allowing him to begin collecting campaign contributions. He will make an initial fund-raising push Monday, when a select group of supporters called "First Day Founders" will attempt to raise at least $46,000 each on that day alone. Given his comparatively late entrance, Thompson will have to work intensively to build a fund-raising base and political organization. The current leading candidates -- Mitt Romney, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and former New York mayor Rudolph Giuli ani -- have each raised millions of dollars; signed on scores of advisers, fund-raisers, and volunteers; and built formidable ground operations in key early primary states. Still, Thompson, 64, is hardly starting from scratch. His acting career, as well as media speculation in the last several months over whether he would run, instantly make him one of the better-known candidates. Indeed, he already registers high -- above Romney, in some cases -- in surveys of likely Republican primary voters. Thompson's supporters say he can capitalize on a hunger many conservatives feel for a top-tier candidate they can whole-heartedly embrace. For them, McCain has gone against the GOP on too many issues, Romney's recent shifts to the right on high-profile issues undermine his credibility, and Giuliani's more liberal social positions make him a nonstarter. "Fred Thompson's entry becomes one of the defining events of the summer," said strategist Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. "He's filling this tremendous void in the conservatives' eyes. He's got a good conservative voting record in the Senate and ran on good Southern, Tennessee values." Thompson has staked out conservative positions on major issues -- he supports gun rights, opposes same-sex marriage, and believes Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion, was wrong. He's also expressed reservations about the Senate immigration reform bill championed by McCain and President Bush. But Thompson doesn't fit the conservative mold perfectly. He has made statements in the past in support of abortion rights, and Christian conservatives backed his primary opponent when he first ran for Senate in 1994. Thompson also backed McCain's landmark campaign finance reform bill, which many conservatives vehemently oppose. And he has acknowledged having a spirited dating life between his first and second marriages. Some prominent social conservatives have privately expressed skepticism about a Thompson candidacy, questioning whether he was an enthusiastic champion for their causes in the Senate. And influential evangelical leader James Dobson, in an interview with US News & World Report earlier this year, said he hadn't seen evidence of Thompson's faith, adding, "I don't think he's a Christian." "The fact is, a lot of Republican primary voters, a lot of conservatives, are looking at the field and sort of saying, 'Hmm, this is interesting, but isn't there somebody else?' " said David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union . "And Fred is somebody else. . . . The question is, who?" In recent months, he has delivered high-profile speeches to Republican groups, put together a nascent campaign team, and visited Capitol Hill to gauge support among Congressional Republicans. Earlier this spring, he fueled speculation he would run by disclosing that he had been diagnosed in 2004 with a treatable form of lymphoma. Now, Thompson faces immediate strategic decisions, including whether to compete in a key straw poll in Ames, Iowa, this August. Success in the poll frequently predicts success in the Iowa caucuses, but doing well in Ames requires methodical -- and expensive -- preparation, something Romney and other GOP candidates have been doing for months. Some Republicans report that Thompson is already generating excitement among party activists. "With all the other candidates, when you mention them with the base, it's, 'I like this, but I don't like that,' " said Brad Unruh, chairman of the Young Professional Republican Federation of Alabama. "But you mention Fred Thompson and, 'Bam, there's my candidate.' " Chip Felkel, a GOP political consultant based in Greenville, S.C., said he's picked up similar sentiments from conservatives there. "The Republican Party is looking for a candidate that has no caveats," said Felkel, who worked on Bush's election campaigns. Thompson, who first made a name for himself as an aide to the Senate Watergate Committee, had been a Washington lawyer, lobbyist, and actor when he ran for Senate in 1994 to complete Al Gore's term, though he won by running a folksy campaign as a pickup- driving populist. He was reelected in 1996 but did not run again in 2002, saying after his 38-year-old daughter died of a heart attack that January, "I simply do not have the heart for another six-year term." He has since played a steely prosecutor on "Law & Order" and has filled in for legendary radio host Paul Harvey. Wire services reported last night that Thompson has told "Law & Order" producer Dick Wolf that he won't return for the new season in September. Thompson didn't discuss any future political plans but "asked to be released from his responsibilities on the show," Wolf said in an e-mailed statement. McCain, Romney, and Giuliani all issued statements welcoming Thompson into the race, but his presence complicates things for each of them in different ways. McCain and Thompson are close -- Thompson helped lead McCain's 2000 presidential campaign, and their Senate voting records have much in common. McCain, who fell short of fund-raising expectations in the first quarter of 2007, cannot afford to lose fund-raisers or potential donors. Some analysts say Thompson's entry would deny Giuliani his status as the GOP's sole celebrity candidate. For Romney, Thompson poses a new threat in the contest for conservative voters. Thompson has also stolen away one of Romney's top supporters in Congress, Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who was with Romney until last week. But with Thompson facing questions about how badly he wants the presidency -- "I have never beaten down a lot of doors in my life," he acknowledged in a recent FOX News interview -- Romney's staff members are convinced that his organization will thwart Thompson's challenge. Thompson's supporters say he has the experience, the presence, and the demeanor to lead the country and heal some of the divisiveness that has rankled Washington. "I think it's a matter of who can best lead the country, who can win the primary, and who can bring together the Democrats, and the Independents, and certainly Republicans back under one candidate," said Mack Mattingly, a former senator from Georgia. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Justin Song came through during Thursday's semifinals with the correct spelling of diastrophe, which means a deformation of Earth's crust. He had advanced to Thursday morning's televised rounds, which began at 7 a.m. local time, by passing a 25-word written test, then correctly spelling the words hoodlum, cytochrome and rissole. Justin competed last year, but was eliminated early. He qualified for a return trip to the national competition by winning the San Diego County Bee in March. He prepared for the national bee by poring over books of complex words and their definitions, and archives of word lists previously used at past spelling bees, according to his mother. The national bee began with a record field of 286 contestants, 11 more than the previous record set last year. It is limited to students in eighth grade or below. In addition to the United States, the field included 10-to-15-year-olds from American Samoa, The Bahamas, Canada, Europe, Guam, Jamaica, New Zealand, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Last year, Justin correctly spelled his word, &#8220;rhadamanthine,&#8221; which means strictly and uncompromisingly just, but his score of 16 was not enough to advance to the quarterfinals. ESPN is televising the semifinals live from 7-10 a.m. and ABC will air the finals on a delayed basis from 8-10 p.m. The winner will receive $20,000, plus two $5,000 cash awards from sponsors, a $2,500 savings bond, reference materials from Encyclopedia Britannica valued at more than $3,800 and an engraved cup. A donation of $5,000 plus 50 reference works will be made to the school or library of the champion's choice. The National Spelling Bee began in 1925.

May 30, 2007 1:11 pm This fraud is being fought with mostly private contractors that get big bucks. Sometimes the soldiers have to train these guys and then are pushed aside. This Iraq Fraud is all about private contractors and corporations that buy Congress. At least watch "Why We Fight" and "Iraq For Sale" before you continue to support this occupation and stealing of tax dollars that could be used to build hospitals, provide medical care and about a million other things here at home. L.A. May 29, 2007 9:46 pm K.B.R. charges about 30 times for laundry alone what a soldier can do for $3.00. In other words, K.B.R. will charge $90.00 at least for what a person can do for $3.00. 40% of the money that Congress controls goes to private contractors. Some of the C.E.O.s of these firms make over $40 million a year. There are over 100,000 private contractors in Iraq and Kuwait. They do not have to abide by the laws of the military. They can even kill without consequence. Remember these corporations that you pay for and they pad the bill to the point of nausea. C.A.C.I., K.B.R., Halliburton, Blackwater, Dyncorp., Transatlantic Traders, Parsons, this Occupation is a Corporate Congressional Fraud designed to exploit taxpayers, military personnel, and even the low level private contractor himself who makes an obscene amount of money compared to a soldier. The soldiers are treated like garbage. This Occupation proves that our government is the most Evil in the world because they are all aware of this and yet do nothing to stop it. Yet they still have the American public in the dark and Brainwashed. See..."Iraq For Sale". Davy Wane May 29, 2007 7:37 pm This is very sad time we are living in. I do believe that our government lost the support of the people home and a round the world. We are stuck in Iraq my friend. We are stuck because we went after a country that our leaders did not like and now we are all alone with out any help forth-coming anyone. It is say, My heart is hurting for my beloved USA. L.A. May 29, 2007 7:24 pm Gotham, Yes, alot of thought is put into our country's decisions for the benefit of big oil, finance and aerospace and defense. We have a dictator here and one of the people pulling the strings is David Rockefeller. One of his favorite stomping grounds is the C.F.R., The Harold Pratt House, 58 East 68th Street, New York, New York 10021. We had our civil war and resolved it. The Iraqi people will have to close the can of worms that we opened. The U.S. is now a military dictatorship, no different than Germany from 1933-1945. The reason we are not pulling out has nothing to do with the civil war. It is that large corporations had Iraq divided up for war spoils decades ago. Democracy indeed!...a farce and lie. Cpl Gotham May 29, 2007 4:24 pm Iraq is currently in a civil war. The reason we are not pulling out is because their police forces and their Gov't will not be able to handle the country and it will split itself. Even if we did pull out with the current state it is in, How hard would it be for someone like saddam or kim jong il or a hitler personality to take power and all of our efforts would be in vien. There is alot of thoughts put into our country's decisions. Johnny Mac May 29, 2007 1:36 pm I think if you pull into a gas station, you'll see that the Iraq war has nothing to do with oil. andre May 29, 2007 1:23 pm Don't think they will beable to steal any at the rate they are going L.A. May 29, 2007 12:56 pm You are right Mike. Don't forget the base building. All of this money can be used to help people who are dying here from things like medical neglect. Everyone knows that WMD was an analysis done accidentally on purpose. There are other agendas but just knowing a few of the big ones should have been enough to wake people up. Apathy and ignorance is destroying this country and has already destroyed Iraq. The real terrorists are the ruling class within our borders and all of the politicians that work for them.....or else suffer the consequences of being put out of office by cutting off their campaign finances.

"New Orleans is coming back, whether you like it or not," Nagin said to applause from the crowd of city workers and community members gathered at the National World War II Museum. "And you might as well deal with it." Returning residents deserve a 'hand up,' Nagin says Nagin called on President Bush and Gov. Kathleen Blanco to do more to help speed the city's recovery from the August 2005 storm. He said Bush has failed to move federal aid to "the people who need it the most," and said he should forgive millions of dollars in disaster loans that the city took out after the storm to help it to continue operating. He also called on Blanco to use a budget surplus to help the city. "Use the $3 billion budget surplus to ensure a strong future for our state and for all our citizens," Nagin said. "Because as New Orleans recovers, and as south Louisiana recovers, so does Louisiana." A message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for Blanco. A White House spokeswoman said the city, not the federal government, must be the force behind the recovery effort. "The federal government has committed more than $110 billion to help the Gulf Coast recover, and we will continue to provide assistance. But the people of the Gulf Coast and their elected leaders must drive the effort to rebuild their lives and their communities," said Jeanie Mamo, a spokeswoman for the White House. Nagin referred to the city's challenges, including a storm-depleted police force dealing with a rise in violent crime and a health care system in "crisis," but he also touted what he deemed successes, from the cleanup of the French Quarter to the return of more than half the city's pre-Katrina population of 455,000. He compared his city to a patient written off as dying who eventually recovered. "We have stabilized. We are implementing plans for our future, and we are strong enough for the next phase of recovery &#8212;the transformation to the new New Orleans," Nagin said. The speech comes just two days before the start of a new hurricane season, and against the backdrop of a city still fighting to recover from a storm 21 months ago. Swaths of some neighborhoods remain in shambles, with houses empty and many small businesses ailing or shuttered. Police still work out of trailers. As of mid-month, the city said it had received just $163 million in federal rebuilding aid, a fraction of the $1 billion or more it says it will need just to restore what Katrina damaged and with little earmarked for permanent infrastructure work. Nagin asked residents &#8212; those in the city and still displaced &#8212; to not lose heart. He said he, too, has dealt with feelings of frustration and despair and with rebuilding challenges such as a new roof leaking that very morning. "Don't give up. Don't give up on us," he said against cheers and applause. "We will be back. The city of New Orleans will be back." Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Let us know about it, at Update: Sonny Carson Avenue The dispute over whether to rename a portion of a Brooklyn street for black activist Sonny Carson sharply split the City Council today. With support from the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, Councilmember Albert Vann introduced an amendment to add Sonny Carson Avenue back to the street renaming package bill. The move failed. Carson Avenue, along with the rest of the street name proposals had been and removed from the street renaming bill after a contentious vote in the parks committee. Councilmembers, the media and the public have of honoring Carson and the process by which streets are renamed. At today&#8217;s meeting, Vann urged his colleagues to vote their conscience and emphasized the importance of honoring the wishes of local communities. Earlier, Vann connected the issue to self-determination and freedom, If you tell us who we cannot honor today, youll tell us who we cannot worship tomorrow. On Memorial Day, Councilmember Charles Barron led an effort to rename a Brooklyn park after Sonny Carson by putting up new signs.  Today, Barron spoke at length on the issue, singling out Letitia James for abstaining from voting on Sonny Carson Avenue while on the Parks Committee and criticizing Council Speaker Christine Quinns efforts to block the renaming. Quinn responded by emphasizing that those who the city honors with street names must reflect the citys core values and principles and unite, not divide, us. Before the meeting, Barron, who has referenced the numerous streets named after slaveholders and the councils honoring of entertainer Al Jolson who dressed in blackface, spoke about the controversial Irish New Yorkers and members of the Irish Republican Army who had been honored by the city in the past and supported by the local African American community. Spectators in the crowded City Hall chambers chanted Whose streets? Our streets. Whose streets? Sonnys streets? and self-determination, but the council voted against adding Sonny Carson Avenue with 15 in favor of the amendment, 25 against and 6 abstaining.  Some councilmembers voiced concerns about the process as they voted no, while others cited allegedly hateful comments by Carson as they emphatically voted no.  Compiled by Sydney Beveridge This entry was posted on Wednesday, May 30th, 2007 at 5:31 pm and is filed under .

Wednesday, water levels of the second largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States tied record lows at 8.97 feet, a record previously set during a drought in May 2001. âThere is no joy over this record breaking event,â said Carol Ann Wehle, Executive Director of the South Florida Water Management District in a release. âAs these extreme weather conditions continue, we are focused on the challenges ahead to best protect drinking water supplies, meet agricultural needs and safeguard our natural resources.â Water levels historically have fluctuated by almost ten feet, according to record keeping dating back to 1931.

She cited her frustration with the Republican and Democratic parties, as well as exhaustion and a desire to be near her children, as reasons for her return home to California. "When I started to hold the Democratic Party to the same standards that I held the Republican Party, support for my cause started to erode," Sheehan wrote in her . "I guess no one paid attention to me when I said that the issue of peace and people dying for no reason is not a matter of 'right or left,' but 'right and wrong.'" Sheehan's decision to withdraw from the anti-war movement comes days after Congress approved a bill authorizing supplemental funding for the war in Iraq without benchmarks for troop withdrawals. Some Democrats, , voted against the bill. But other Democrats defended their support of the supplemental funding by saying that Democrats in Congress currently do not have enough votes to override the president's veto of a bill that includes benchmarks. Representative John Murtha (D-PA) said that Congress will receive a report of the surge, which he said "is not producing the results that were promised," in September. He said that the Democrats will then find "the votes from both Democrats and Republicans to change policy and direction." The approved supplemental bill includes funds to benefit veterans and Hurricane Katrina victims. A minimum wage provision that extends to the Northern Mariana Islands is also included.

Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., head of the Immigration Reform Caucus, took offense at President Bush&#8217;s assertion that critics of a Senate immigration bill were determined to find fault with the measure by looking &#8220;at a narrow slice of it.&#8221; &#8220;Amnesty for 12-20 million illegal immigrants isn&#8217;t a &#8216;narrow slice&#8217; Mr. President, it&#8217;s the whole darn pie,&#8221; Bilbray said, in a press release. &#8220;The American people want us to secure the border and crackdown on the number one incentive for illegal immigration which is illegal employment - they don&#8217;t want another amnesty,&#8221; he added. The House Immigration Reform Caucus has more than 100 members who are pushing for stronger enforcement against illegal immigration. Bush made the statement Tuesday at a federal training facility in Glynco, Ga. The president said: &#8220;Those determined to find fault with this bill will always be able to look at a narrow slice of it and find something they don&#8217;t like. If you want to kill the bill, if you don&#8217;t want to do what&#8217;s right for America, you can pick one little aspect out of it, you can use it to frighten people.&#8221; The president contends that the measure is not amnesty because it requires illegal immigrants to pay fines, learn English and wait for years before they can become permanent legal residents. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee also objected to Bush&#8217;s &#8220;narrow slice&#8221; comment. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter how you slice it, the Senate amnesty bill is a raw deal for American workers and the rule of law&#8230;according to a law dictionary or common sense, the Senate bill is amnesty,&#8221; he said. May 31, 2007 2:55 AM | According to Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation the Presidents amnesty program would result in 100 new American voters whom by 80% would vote democrat, bankrupt social security, and END his own republican party. This President has lost his mind. Time to impeach his derelict derriere. He will guard IRAQs borders but now ours. Take a look at what is going on in Venezuela, it is coming to a town near you. By the way are Linda and Hugo Chavez related? May 31, 2007 3:14 AM | This is the right time for a rational and realistic approach to immigration. President Bush and the Senate are on the right path.

Pu, an eighth-grader from Auburn, was No. 277 of 286 spellers in this year's bee, which forced him to wait on stage for 45 minutes during Round 2 and nearly two hours for round three while others faced the ultimate challenge in spelling. Pu made it to the third round Wednesday but tripped on the word "rambla," which means dry ravine. Pu, who admitted he wasn't familiar with the word, spelled it "rombla." The disappointing end was in direct contrast to his strong and confident performance earlier in the day. Despite waiting for nearly 100 spellers to finish in round two, Pu didn't waste any time when his name was called. He stepped to the microphone. He heard the word, asked for a definition then barely hesitated before correctly spelling "shindig." The success pushed him through to the third round of the nation's premier -- and most difficult -- spelling competition and a step closer to a grand prize of $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. He was in the third round with 106 other spellers, along with much tougher words and immense pressure. All 107 qualified by scoring high enough on a 25-word written test and spelling a word to a large audience. Pu admitted the wait was tough. "It's true. Because you're waiting for your turn and you don't really pay much attention to the other people, and then when it's your turn, you get really nervous," said Pu, who attends Federal Way Public Academy. He was sponsored by the Seattle P-I. In past years, spellers from Washington state have grown apprehensive as they watch competitors spell easy words. The fear, they have said, is that the quota of manageable words will end, leaving them with brutally difficult words. Pu had no such thoughts: "I like to think optimistically." Pu wasn't the only one who breezed through the early rounds only to fall in round three. The round eliminated 13 of the 107 who began. With more free time than expected, Pu said he will watch the bee, go sightseeing in Washington, D.C., and concentrate on one other goal. "I want to convince my sister to start spelling," he said. The oral round was hardly taxing for the top spellers. Tia Thomas, 12, of Coarsegold, Calif., back for her fourth national bee, correctly spelled "flagrant." The audience laughed when pronouncer Jacques Bailly defined "ninety" as "being one more than 89" for 13-year-old Mary Harrington of Vineyard Haven, Mass. Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kan., made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever when correctly spelling "enumerated." Kate Weir, 13, of Christchurch, New Zealand, traveled far to participate, and she must have thought the wait was even longer when she was kept at the microphone while the judges conferred over her Kiwi-accented spelling of "eeriness." Her spelling was eventually declared correct. The bee concludes Thursday night with the champion being crowned during a prime-time broadcast.

H. R. Jackson, Jr. L. Rossiter, Jr, MD On the blog now: Updated at 12:58 PM Bugliosi on the Assassination of JFK Updated: 12:19 PM 05/31/07 When Media Pit-Yorkies Attack Updated: 12:12 PM 05/31/07 Yepsen: In Iowa, Thompson Hurts Romney Updated: 11:29 AM 05/31/07 Updated: 10:29 AM 05/31/07 I Offer My Show, All Three Hours, And Invite Michael Medved To Co-host Updated: 10:13 AM 05/31/07 The Fred Factor and the Al Davis Republicans Thursday, May 31, 2007 "[Thompson] is sure to face sharper criticism from those who say that his eight-year Senate record was undistinguished and that his credentials as a conservative are marred by his support of campaign finance reform. Some also say he is a lackadaisical campaigner, pointing to his sometimes rambling maiden speech last month in Orange County, Calif., as evidence that he is overhyped. Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who helps conduct the NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll with Democrat Peter Hart, said an analysis of their most recent poll indicated that Thompson's entry could initially hurt Giuliani and McCain." --a Michael Shear and Dan Ballz story in The Washington Post, 5/31/07 It is different in the pool. There are elbows, and reporters, and opposition research. But from the perspective of a columnist and talk show host, the entry of Fred Thompson into the race is a great day. The sooner the GOP debates get down to the big four (plus Newt if he gets in) the better. Senator Brownback, Governor Huckabee, and Congressman Hunter are fine men and serious public servants, but if you canât get over 10% in even one state poll from among the first four states in which contests will be held âIowa, New Hampshire, Florida and South Carolinaâyou shouldnât be in the first tier, and only the first tier should be taking up prime time in the months ahead. Many of my blog readers think I am in the bag for Romney based on my bookâs disclosure that if the California primary had been held the day the book appeared I would have voted for Romney. That assessment still holds, but as the book noted, campaigns are long, strange affairs. People cry in the back of trucks. Candidates grab microphones and fall off stages. Even presidents can make astonishing errors in their appearances, and they have the best advance team in the world. So a lot can happen between now and next January and February. Fred Thompson is yet another entrant in the GOP lists who is serious about the war, making that unanimous agreement among the GOP top tier versus a unanimous endorsement of retreat and date certain defeat among the Democrats. Thereâs the defining issue f the general campaign. One of the defining issues of the primary campaign will be the immigration bill, and it has defined John McCain right out of his already thin chance to be the nominee. He has now added McCain-Kennedy 2.0 to McCain-Feingold, The Gang of 14, McCain-Kennedy 1.0 and the display of pique last September on the trial and treatment of terrorists in an impressive bid to antagonize every conservative on at least two grounds. I donât think he makes it to Iowa and the humiliation of fourth place finishes there and in New Hampshire. As the Post notes, Thompson bleeds McCain immediately, giving all the early McCain boosters who thought they were signing up for a front-runner certain to benefit from the GOPâs ânext-in-lineâ tradition of nominees a chance for a Mulligan. Do-overs are rare in politics, but the unexpected arrival on the scene of an âold friendâ presents just such an opportunity. Mayor Giuliani and Governor Romney might lose some folks as well, but their supporters signed up for something completely different than a coronation, and thus far they are getting exactly what they ought to have expected: vibrant and interesting campaigns by candidates of the sort that donât normally show up in the GOP primaries. Fred Thompson arrives with many on the sidelines whispering Reagan. Perhaps, but just perhaps. President Reagan was a Californian, not a southerner, an upbeat and sunny optimist who had spent 16 years on the chicken circuit helping the party, and having made one unsuccessful run for the GOP nomination. Few Republicans every thought to raise questions about Reaganâs fire in the belly. What Republicans really want is a candidate capable of handling the coming onslaught. There is a great fear in the GOP that Hillary is approaching with Bill in the sidecar and Senator Obama on the bottom of the ticket, MoveOn and Kosputin whipping the fever swamp into a frenzy and Soros pouring his last cent into his last play. Thompson as Reagan meant for a lot of these people not Thompson as a conservative's conservative, but Thompson as a powerful candidate capable of summoning a huge outpouring of energy and enthusiasm from the base and the old Reagan Democrats alike leading to a big win as in 1980 and 1984. Couldn't we please have a candidate who could establish and keep a lead like the Gipper. Except, of course, Ronald Reagan did not establish and keep a lead in 1980. Until the last few days of the race, President Carter and Governor Reagan were viewed as neck-and-neck in a race too close to call. There isn't any reason to believe that Fred would have any easier a go of it than Rudy or Mitt, and as that becomes obvious in the days and weeks and months after his entry, the folks hoping for an easy win are going to drop that enthusiasm and start looking hard again at all three, asking which one is the best candidate. These are the Al Davis Republicans --"Just win, baby"-- and their support will be decisive in 1Q08. One reason I suspect the Fred boom may be over before it has even really begun is the recognition that on the stump Fred will be seen as the southerner he is --slow, folksy, plain spoken. In a year when an anti-Bush may be needed, a Brooklyn-born Mob-busting tough guy, or the hyper-intelligent, hyper-eloquent investment banker turnaround executive may emerge quickly as far more likely to be the "something completely different " that Reagan was in 1980, and thus the strong preference of the Al Davis GOPers. Too early to say, and besides, no one in my business would want a rout one way or the other. A long campaign of intense debates and lots of press attacks and parries is exactly what the eventual nominee will need to be in fighting shape for the fall of â08. Hillary is not going to get bloodied along the way as Senators Edwards and Obama know better than to poke that nest. Sheâll process to Denver, and then when the storm arrives weâll see which party had the better approach.

O'Dorney -- stumped by the word "mirliton" in 2006 -- finished 14th last year and was 17th as a spelling bee rookie in 2005. This year, he has advanced through a written test and four rounds to be one of three California students remaining in the event. In round five, O'Dorney spelled "affiche" correctly. Two other contestants from the Bay Area were out by Wednesday's fourth round. John Doner from San Francisco misspelled "ursigram" to be eliminated in the fourth round while Kyle Rogacion of Salinas did not advance to the third round. O'Dorney told the Contra Costa Times that he wasn't feeling any pressure coming into the bee. "I'm not hoping for anything," he told the paper. "I'm just going to do my best." While O'Dorney wasn't feeling any outward pressure, all eyes were focused on 13-year-old Samir Patel is trying to avoid becoming the Dan Marino of spelling. Samir, a Dallas Cowboys fan from Colleyville, Texas, knows all about Marino's 17-year Hall of Fame career as the Miami Dolphins' quarterback, in which he set records but never won a championship. This week, Samir is one of the favorites to win as he makes his fifth and final appearance in the bee. Samir breezed through "decor" without a hitch. Tia Thomas, 12, of Coarsegold, Calif., back for her fourth national bee, correctly spelled "flagrant." Both advanced to the quarterfinals. "Having come for five years, I'm a lot more prepared than I was the first year," said Samir, who has finished third, 27th, second and 14th. "I'm not as nervous, and I already know sort of the routine, so I'm not so much worried about 'Am I going to be there on time?''Am I going to make a mistake in walking down the stage?'" Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kan., made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever by correctly spelling "enumerated" and advanced to the quarterfinals. Kate Weir, 13, of Christchurch, New Zealand, traveled far to participate, and she must have felt the wait was even longer when she was kept at the microphone while the judges conferred over her Kiwi-accented spelling of "eeriness." Her spelling was eventually replayed over the loudspeakers before it was declared correct. There were a few flubs. Ten-year-old Seher Sethi of Rhinebeck, N.Y., let out a sigh after misspelling "pallbearer." Christian Wilks, 10, of Freeport, Ill., tried to put an "a" and an extra "l" in "felony." During the breaks, the ballroom was vibrant with spellers who have become fast friends during their short time in Washington  and some who have formed a camaraderie over the years. Matthew Evans, a 12-year-old from Albuquerque, N.M., who is also appearing for the fourth time, excitedly compared notes with Tia following the multiple choice test. Matthew said he got 24 correct. The semifinals and finals take place Thursday, with the champion crowned in prime time on ABC for the second consecutive year. The winner receives $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. . The Associated Press contributed to this report. All rights reserved.

Gray of the Colorado State University updated his hurricane predictions for the 2007 storm season, expecting 17 named storms and nine hurricanes in the Atlantic basin. The forecasts were unchanged from his last bulletin. This image depicts a 3-day average of actual sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, from August 25-27, 2005. Image Credit: NASA/SVS. Gray said there is a 74 percent chance of at least one major (Category 3, 4, or 5) hurricane hitting the U.S. coastline (average probability for last century is 52 percent) and a 50 percent change of such a storm hitting the U.S. East Coast (versus a 31 percent risk for the past century). Gray also noted that he's handing the reigns of hurricane forecasting over to Philip J. Klotzbach so that he can devote more time to the "global warming issue." Gray believes that the human contribution to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions is overstated. Gray expects the 2007 hurricane season to be similar to those of 2003 (7 hurricanes, 3 of which were "major") and 1995 (19 named storms, 11 hurricanes).

Plame and her publisher, Simon & Schuster, sued the CIA in a New York federal court on May 31. They accused the government of illegally refusing to let Plame write about the specific dates she worked for the agency. The CIA, which has acknowledged only that Plame worked for the agency since 2002, must approve all writings of former officers before they can be published. "The sole benchmark is whether it contains classified information," CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said. "The concern is that publication of the manuscript as submitted would cause additional damage to operations and would affect the CIA&#39;s ability to conduct intelligence activities in the future. That&#39;s the issue here and it&#39;s an important one." Plame contends in court documents that the CIA released information about her work history in an unclassified letter about her retirement benefits. The letter, which the CIA says was sent inadvertently, was ultimately entered into the Congressional Record and says that Plame worked at the CIA for more than 20 years. Plame&#39;s lawsuit was announced on the eve of the annual trade convention BookExpo America, when publishers often try to release big news. Plame is scheduled to speak at the convention today. The book deal for Plame&#39;s memoir, is widely believed to be worth seven figures. Lawyers asked a federal judge in New York to order the CIA to allow Plame to print the information. No one was charged with leaking Plame&#39;s employment status. Vice President Dick Cheney&#39;s former chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, was convicted of obstructing the investigation and faces up to three years in prison when he is sentenced on June 5. On May 31, a federal judge said he would release more than 150 letters he received regarding next week&#39;s sentencing. The letters are expected to show that, despite his conviction in March of perjury and obstruction in the CIA leak case, Libby retains support from current and former government officials. Libby opposed release of the letters, saying the writers never expected their words to be made public. Attorneys for several news organizations, including the Associated Press, responded last week by saying the law required the letters be released. U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton agreed with the news organizations, citing a need for transparency. "The court has received more than 150 sentencing letters in this case, some urging leniency for the defendant and some expressing opprobrium at the defendant&#39;s actions and calling for the imposition of a substantial prison sentence," Walton wrote. Cheney recently called Libby&#39;s conviction "a great tragedy" but a spokeswoman for the vice president would not say whether Cheney wrote a letter to the court. White House press secretary Tony Snow said he did not know whether President Bush wrote a letter. The letters are to be released after Libby is sentenced on June 5, Walton said. Addresses and other personal information won&#39;t be released. Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, who has seen the letters, did not weigh in on whether to release them but noted that correspondence from current and former public officials is presumed to be public. Libby&#39;s legal defense fund has received public support from several former government officials, including former Republican Reps. Jack Kemp and Bill Paxon, former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and former Republican Sens. Alan Simpson, Don Nickles and Fred Thompson â a likely presidential candidate. Libby was convicted of lying about his conversations with reporters about Plame, whose secret position was revealed in a 2003 newspaper column. Libby was not the source for that story but a jury found that he made several false statements to leak investigators and obstructed the investigation. Prosecutors want Libby to serve up to three years in prison. Libby&#39;s lawyers said yesterday it would be unfair. Citing numerous letters from former colleagues and friends, they said Libby deserved only probation. "His dedication to promoting freedom abroad and keeping American citizens safe at home is beyond question," the attorneys wrote. Probation officers recommend a sentencing range of 15-21 months, but left open the possibility that defense attorneys could argue for less. Libby&#39;s attorneys say his distinguished career should persuade Walton to spare him prison. Former senator contends Libby prosecutor out of control Fred Thompson says Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald must have known from beginning that disclosing CIA officer&#39;s name was not a crime. 02.14.07 Libby found guilty in CIA leak case Former White House aide is convicted of obstruction, perjury but acquitted of one of two counts of lying to FBI. 03.06.07 View the latest news stories throughout the First Amendment Center Online.

Fighting for rights, mourning a fighter Marine battles military over his participation in antiwar activities Liam Madden, right, is one of three inactive reserve members facing Marine investigations for antiwar activities. (Lawrence Jackson/Associated Press) By Stephanie Ebbert, Globe Staff | Liam Madden was leading a cause before he became one. The 22-year-old former Marine sergeant had cofounded Appeal for Redress, a campaign urging troops to press Congress for an end to the Iraq war. Now, the Boston man is battling the military over his right to engage in antiwar activities, sparked when he received a certified letter threatening him with an "other than honorable discharge" from the reserves for wearing camouflage during a protest and for making "disloyal statements" accusing the Bush administration of war crimes. He viewed the threat as ammunition for his antiwar efforts. "I thought, 'this is trying to intimidate and clamp down on political opposition to the war,' " Madden said. "And I saw it as an opportunity to make them regret that they're doing this." Madden, who plans to attend Northeastern University in the fall, is one of three inactive reserve members facing Marine investigations for antiwar activities, in a controversial move that is spurring debate about free speech. As members of the Individual Ready Reserve, the men could be called up for service, but are not being paid or participating in training. They argue they have every right to be heard. "It seems to me as a civilian he's just as free as you and I to say the Bush administration has done bad things in Iraq and we ought to get out," said Arthur Spitzer, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in Washington, D.C., who was meeting with Madden yesterday. "Who is better qualified to speak to those issues than someone who has seen combat in Iraq? If what's going on here is an effort by the Marines to intimidate over 100,000 people in the Individual Ready Reserves from speaking out against the war, then it's a very nefarious activity on their part and very important to stop it." The Marine Corps confirmed the administrative action against Madden and one of the other two activists, but did not return calls. "By contract, they are still members of the Marine Corps IRR and must maintain standards of conduct in accordance with their oath of enlistment," the statement said. A Department of Defense spokesman, Major Stewart T. Upton, pointed to a policy covering reserves as well as active troops that warns against wearing a uniform during political events because it could be viewed as endorsement by the military. "The Marine Corps' digital cammies are trademark," Upton said. But the nation's largest combat veterans group urged the military yesterday to "exercise a little common sense" and call off its investigation, the Associated Press reported. "Trying to hush up and punish fellow Americans for exercising the same democratic right we're trying to instill in Iraq is not what we're all about," said Gary Kurpius, national commander of the 2.4 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars. "Someone in the Marine Corps needs to exercise a little common sense and put an end to this matter before it turns into a circus. " Madden, a Vermont native, enlisted months before the US invasion of Iraq and served about seven months in Anbar Province. Honorably discharged after four years, Madden helped form the Appeal for Redress, urging troops to speak out respectfully, with attention to their legal rights and limitations. Active members of the military may attend demonstrations but only in the United States, off base, and out of uniform, his website warns. Madden does not believe that a dishonorable discharge from the reserves would affect his benefits. Madden spoke by cellphone while on a train to Washington, where he held a press conference at Union Station late yesterday before embarking by bus to Kansas City, Mo., with Adam Kokesh, a fellow Marine who faces a hearing Monday on his antiwar activities. Madden's own hearing has not yet been scheduled. Iraq Veterans Against the War identified the third Marine reservist and antiwar activist being investigated as Cloy Richards of Missouri. The Marines' statement did not mention any administrative action against him. Madden, head of the Boston chapter of the Iraq Veterans Against the War, acknowledges the circumstances that led to accusations that he made "disloyal statements." "Not only do I believe I have the right to do that, I believe that it's the right thing to do and that I'm being truthful," Madden said yesterday. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

"It's time we leveled and are straight with the American people about the situation" the country is in, Thompson said. "The American people are waiting." The actor and former senator from Tennessee spoke for about 35 minutes at the Virginia Republican Party's annual gala here, receiving a minute-long standing ovation when he was introduced. During the speech, Thompson appeared to be testing out themes and catch phrases for future use. Some worked. Others didn't. His harsh criticism of the proposed immigration reform bill worked out by some GOP and Democratic leaders in the Senate received the most enthusiastic response - by far. "This is our home and we get to decide who gets to come into our home," he said. Thompson said Congress needs to "secure the border first before you do anything else," drawing another standing ovation. National defense in general and defending the country against fundamentalist Islamic terrorists specifically received the most time in his remarks. He talked of enemies who would "like to see a mushroom cloud over a city in the United States" and said that the country's defense budget was at a historic low of 4 percent of the nation's economic output. He talked of the need to permanently eliminate the estate tax and reminded the audience that "when you cut taxes and cut tax rates it grows the economy." And while he decried the partisanship in Washington, Thompson took his share of shots at Democrats. He mentioned Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., when he criticized the immigration legislation. And he said "Democrats are hot after repealing" President Bush's tax cuts. With Thompson as the keynote speaker, the gala drew 450 guests at $125 per ticket, about twice the attendance as last year. The party sought Thompson in an effort to rebuild party coffers in a state that helped give the Democrats its slim majority in the Senate when Jim Webb beat incumbent George Allen. Before his speech, Thompson roamed the high-ceiling room at the Greater Richmond Convention Center shaking hands and having his photo taken with guests. One of the first to grab Thompson's large hand was Noella Oberlin of Cleveland, Tenn., who made the drive to Richmond figuring that it would be easier to get a glimpse of Thompson early in his campaign. "I am thrilled he's running and I can't wait to vote for him," Oberlin said. "We have hope." Thompson's next major public appearance will be as a guest on the "Tonight Show" with Jay Leno on June 12. On Friday, he formed Friends of Fred Thompson Inc. to raise money and hire staff to explore running for president. Even before forming the committee, Thompson, part of the cast of the long-running "Law & Order" TV show, finished third among possible among GOP presidential candidates in national polls. , Draft Fred Thompson site.

(AP PHOTO/WEATHER UNDERGROUND) A truck jack-knifes in Florida due to conditions caused by tropical depression Barry. Tropical storm Barry weakens to depression Updated Sat. Jun. 2 2007 6:15 PM ET -- Tropical storm Barry weakened into a tropical depression as it moved through Tampa Bay on Saturday, though its rains brought some relief to the drought-parched region. Forecasters discontinued the tropical storm warnings and watches issued for stretches of the Gulf Coast. The depression's sustained winds had slowed to near 56 km/h and it was moving north-northeast at about 37 km/h. The storm made landfall in the Tampa Bay area around 10 a.m. EDT, according to Daniel Brown, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center. "The landfall in a case like this is kind of insignificant," Brown said. In Mexico, tropical storm Barbara made landfall Saturday on the southern Pacific coast near the Guatemala border, an area notoriously vulnerable to flooding. With maximum winds of nearly 80 km/h and higher gusts, Barbara was centred just southwest of the Mexican city of Tapachula. The storm was heading northeast at 11 km/h, and was expected to weaken as it continues moving inland over southeast Mexico and western Guatemala, the hurricane centre said. A tropical storm warning was in effect from Sipacate, Guatemala, to Barra de Tonala, Mexico, and the hurricane centre warned that Barbara could unleash life-threatening flooding and mudslides. Heavy rains were reported. Rain was falling throughout drought-stricken Florida and Georgia, where the dry conditions have fed wildfires for weeks. "We're hoping several of these fires will not be a problem anymore," said the Florida Division of Forestry's Mike Newell. "It's too early to tell right now. Everybody's basically waiting for the rain to stop to go out and see what's going on." The depression was expected to drop seven to 15 centimetres of rain on parts of those states, along with South Carolina and North Carolina on Saturday. Isolated areas could get up to 25 centimetres of rain. The National Weather Service said isolated tornadoes over central Florida were possible. A tropical storm warning was cancelled after being issued from Bonita Beach on Florida's southwest coast northward to Keaton Beach, near the state's Big Bend area. A tropical storm watch for the area between Keaton Beach west to St. Marks, south of Tallahassee, also was cancelled. The storm developed Friday, the first official day of a hurricane season that forecasters have said they expect to be busier than normal. The National Weather Service said it expects 13 to 17 tropical storms, with seven to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to five in the strong category. "There is no correlation at all between activity in the early part of the season and later parts," said Lixion Avila, a hurricane specialist at the centre. Barry formed more than three weeks after the first named storm of the year - subtropical storm Andrea - developed off Florida's eastern coast. Andrea skirted the southern Atlantic coast but caused minimal damage.

Way out on the right and left margins of the line-up were peace candidate Representative Dennis Kucinich and maverick former senator from Alaska Mike Gravel. As in the Republican primary, it is the job of these quixotic figures to tell the unvarnished truth, while the rest of the field and debate moderator Wolf Blitzer smile condescendingly. Gravel, sounding like his Republican counterpart Ron Paul, was the voice of reason on Iraq. But he also set the record straight on gays in the military. While Hillary Clinton struggled with her qualified endorsement of her husband's don't-ask-don't-tell policy, Gravel explained that, no, it is not complicated and difficult to craft the perfect compromise on this issue as the frontrunner suggested. Just as Harry Truman integrated the military by executive fiat in one fell swoop, so, too, can the President order the simple integration of gays and lesbians. Kucinich was slower out of the blocks, failing to give a direct answer to a question about whether the Patriot Act, which he rightly opposed, made possible the recent arrest of terrorist suspects plotting an attack on Kennedy Airport. Instead of dealing directly with the issue, Kucinich said something vaguely confusing about how Americans need to reconnect with their essential identity. Still, it was he who called his fellow Democrats to account on funding for the war. The power of the purse is Congress's only way to check the war. If they pull the funding, "the war is over," he said. He, too, set Hillary Clinton straight on whether it is possible to stop having an endless "conversation," and do the right thing. Kucinich corrected Clinton's suggestion that Iraq is Bush's war and the Democrats are neither culpable nor fully in control. "Oh, no," Kucinich said. "This is the Democrats' war, because the Democrats were put in charge in the last election." While Hillary and Obama both voted against the recent cave-in on continued funding, both have voted previously, and repeatedly, for other funding resolutions, and expressed sympathy for their colleague Joe Biden, who said, "We're funding the safety of the troops"--never mind that continuing the war will only cost more lives. Biden won't stop voting for more funding, he said, until there is an even larger Democratic majority in Congress. Too bad for the people who die waiting for the Democratic leadership to pull that one off. Edwards also attacked the two frontrunners for failing to speak out against the recent cave-in that sent more money to the war without any timetables for withdrawal. They ultimately voted the right way, he said, but at the last minute and without comment. The bill, Edwards said, was the "moment of truth" on Iraq. Anyone who wants to be President has "a responsibility to lead" on the crucial issue of getting us out of the war. Obama came out ahead in the exchange with Edwards, though, pointing out that Edwards had voted for the war originally. "You are four and a half years late on leadership on this," he said. Little noted during the debate was Hillary's most conservative statement of the night. Taking a line straight from the neocons who got us into this disastrous war in the first place, Clinton asserted "it is the Iraqis who failed to take advantage of those opportunities" that we supposedly gave them. Blaming Bush, underplaying the Democrats' ability to end the war, chastising the Iraqis ala Donald Rumsfeld, and giving vague, mixed signals about how she plans to lead, it's Clinton who gives the antiwar base plenty of reason to feel nervous. On the popular-outside-Washington issue of universal health care, Edwards challenged his opponents by pointing to his more detailed and more progressive plan, which actually covers everyone. Obama and Clinton also used the phrase "universal health care," but neither has produced a truly universal plan, Edwards pointed out. Still, it was up to Kucinich to shout from the wings that "there's only one way" to get to universal health coverage, and that is "a single-payer, not-for-profit " system like Canada and most of Europe have. That's not on the table among the mainstream candidates. "They're talking about letting the insurance companies stay in charge," he said. "We need a President to challenge that." In our strange political culture, the Democratic candidates all denounced the havoc Bush has wreaked in Iraq and lamented the demise of American diplomacy and credibility abroad, yet submitted to several flippant "show of hands" votes posed by Blitzer: quick, raise your hand if you are willing to kill a bunch of innocent civilians with a Hellfire missile in order to get Osama bin Laden! Only Kucinich balked at that one, asserting that he's not in favor of foreign policy by assassination. Obama quickly stepped in to show he's not afraid to pull the trigger. Clinton, alone among the candidates, objected to the testosterone test style of decision making--quick, you're under attack, how fast can you deploy missiles to kill a bunch of people without stopping to flinch. Isn't this style of leadership what got us into the mess we're in today? Clinton, to her credit, pointed out that a more considered approach might be what we want from our next President.

A major part of the former Tennessee senator's strategy is a heavy reliance on the Internet to get his message out and to raise funds. He is also trying to tap into the large number of well-heeled Republican financiers who have yet to commit to a 2008 hopeful, amid widespread disaffection among party loyalists with the current field. Yet a late start and signs that Mr. Thompson may adopt an unconventional campaign style -- limiting in-person appearances by making extensive use of blogging and online video -- could crimp the television actor's ability to raise money over the long haul. He has suggested he isn't enamored of leaving his family for long stretches of campaign travel. The question is whether an Internet campaign will help him raise money quickly or leave big donors cold. Signs suggest that he won't have trouble in the early going. In a conference call Tuesday with more than 100 supporters, Mr. Thompson flogged each to raise a quick $46,000 by early this week to become "First Day Founders," participants said. Each can presumably meet his or her goal by tapping 20 friends to make a maximum $2,300 individual donation. If they do, Mr. Thompson will start his campaign with a quick display of fund-raising prowess and about $5 million on hand. "I see the indecision and noncommitted people on the Republican side who are yearning for a conservative," said Mack Mattingly, a former Georgia senator who was on the conference call and committed to raising the cash. "I don't see raising money as a big problem. Even bad candidates are raising money." Mr. Mattingly said the quick money infusion into Mr. Thompson's campaign is calculated to be "part of the splash" the "Law and Order" star makes this week in a race where polls have already placed even his prospective candidacy toward the top of the pack. Mr. Thompson's ability to raise money for a presidential campaign formally began Friday, with official creation of an exploratory committee in Nashville. Mr. Thompson will have a boost from Tennessee Republican Rep. Zach Wamp, who says his four-month-old draft-Thompson Web site has collected the email addresses of 30,000 people who have signaled they are willing to help a Thompson campaign. Mr. Wamp was also on the fund-raising call. Mr. Thompson also comes late to other factors of the campaign, such as building organizations in crucial states and establishing name recognition among voters. But the 2008 presidential race is marked in the early going by the tidal wave of money that has already flowed to the top candidates in both campaigns. The Republican money leader so far is former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, whose first-quarter fund-raising total stood at $20 million. Rudy Giuliani and John McCain raised $16 million and $13 million, respectively. Delaying his candidacy cost Mr. Thompson support of two prominent Tennessee fund-raisers: Chip Saltsman, former state party chairman, who raised more than $100,000 for President Bush's 2004 race; and Ted Welch, a Nashville developer who raised more than $200,000 for Mr. Bush's last campaign, becoming a Bush "Ranger." Mr. Saltsman has committed to longshot Arkansas ex-Gov. Mike Huckabee. Mr. Welch said he would have been happy to raise funds for Mr. Thompson but has already committed to Mr. Romney. Brad Freeman, a Los Angeles investment banker and Bush Ranger who is raising money for Mitt Romney, said most of his friends have already committed. He points to Mr. Welch as a symbol of the difficulties that may face Mr. Thompson: "Even his natural constituency is spoken for," Mr. Freeman said. "I think he'll find it tough sledding -- a lot of ships have sailed." WHO'S IN FOR 2008 who's in and who's out for the 2008 U.S. presidential race, and how much money they've raised. And in a hint of what could become a problem with an Internet-heavy strategy, Mr. Wamp said Mr. Thompson fielded a number of questions about his platform in the conference call last week on positions that the candidate has already sketched out. "The money people aren't bloggers and activists, so they didn't know Fred has spoken extensively about many of these issues, such as immigration," Mr. Wamp said. "So I broke in and told them it's all collected on our Web site, and they should go and take a look." Few Republican operatives doubt Mr. Thompson can raise the initial $5 million he seeks. As one major party fund-raiser noted, "You don't put out a figure like that unless you're pretty sure you can get there." Moreover, the fund-raiser said, four large states that turned out well for President Bush in 2004 have been tapped only lightly by the current crop of candidates. The states he cited are Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan. "I expect Fred will concentrate on those," said the fund-raiser, who has committed to another candidate. First-quarter finance reports suggest numerous former Bush mega-fund-raisers remain uncommitted and could be tapped. In Florida, for example, Gov. Charlie Crist has a massive fund-raising apparatus and has notably avoided formally endorsing anyone. And former Gov. Jeb Bush has yet to back anyone. "I will remain neutral and try to help our party's nominee," he said in an email.

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's decision to take opposition broadcaster RCTV off the air "undemocratic" and called for the Organization of American States (OAS) to investigate the incident. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro shot back by comparing the U.S. imprisonment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay to Nazi Germany and by accusing Washington of meddling in his country's affairs. The testy exchanges played out at a meeting of the OAS that was supposed to be about energy but instead was marked by Rice and Maduro making dueling speeches and then each demanding the right to respond to the other. Rice fired the first shot by telling reporters as she flew to Panama: "I do not see how closing down an opposition (TV station) literally because they have taken you on and taken on your policies can be seen as anything but anti-democratic," "The unfettered public discussion of ideas is the greatest guarantee for the rule of law and the surest protection against the whims of rulers," she then told OAS officials, singling out Venezuela for its closure of RCTV. Chavez took RCTV off the air on May 27, silencing what had been a major opponent to reforms that have given the leftist leader greater control over the judiciary, the military and the oil sector of the OPEC member. Two days later, he called news channel Globovision -- the last main opposition media in Venezuela although it does not have nationwide coverage -- an enemy of the state and said he would do what was necessary to stop it from inciting violence. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Flight 3050 was en route from Sacramento to San Diego on Sunday when the pilot noticed a problem with the nose wheel just after takeoff. The plane was diverted to Oakland where it landed, with the nose wheel collapsing as it touched down. There were no injuries. The 119 passengers and crew evacuated the plane on an inflatable slide. A crane was being brought in from Phoenix to lift the plane off the runway. Because the main runway remains blocked until then, passengers with flights from Oakland International have been told to check with their airlines about any delays.

In a speech at a Virginia state party dinner, the conservative former Tennessee senator and Hollywood actor made only passing reference to his presidential ambitions but took a jab at Democrats while praising limited government and lower taxes. "There are all kinds of threats out there in America," Thompson said, citing a disrupted plot at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York as the latest example. He said the United States must send a message to its allies about the dangers of terrorism. "This is a battle between the forces of civilization and the forces of evil and we've got to choose sides," Thompson said. Thompson took the first formal step toward running on Friday with the formation in Tennessee of a committee that will allow him to hire staff and raise money for a presidential campaign. His late candidacy, fueled in part by conservative dissatisfaction with the 10 official Republican candidates, has stirred heavy interest among curious activists and could fill a void for conservatives. Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has led the field for months ahead of Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. But many conservatives are dissatisfied with all three top contenders and Thompson already runs third in many national polls, ahead of Romney. Thompson has broad name recognition from years as a Hollywood actor in movies like "The Hunt for Red October" and his just-concluded role of a district attorney on NBC's "Law and Order." &copy; Reuters 2007.

The video, which was not independently verified, featured a still image of the photo identifications of Spc. Alex R. Jimenez , 25, of Lawrence, Massachusetts, and Pvt. Byron W. Fouty, 19, of Waterford, Michigan, as well as personal items belonging to the two missing soldiers. While the Pentagon spokesman did not confirm the authenticity of the video, a spokesperson did tell the BBC that the ID cards on the video did appear to be genuine. Jimenez and Fouty were seized with Pfc. Joseph J. Anzack Jr., 20, of Torrance, California, following a May 12 ambush south of Baghdad. While the both Jimenez and Fouty's whereabouts remain unknown, on May 23, Anzack's body was found in the Euphrates River, south of Baghdad. While U.S. and Iraqi forces continue their hunt for the missing soldiers, the U.S. government has also offered rewards of up to $200,000 for the safe return of the two men.

Federal Judge Reggie B. Walton is scheduled to respond to the recommendation of the special prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, that Libby spend from 30 to 37 months in prison. Libby's lawyers have urged the judge to reject jail time on grounds he had done nothing illegal in leaking the identity of the agent. Ever since Libby's conviction, a steady buzz has circulated in political circles about whether President Bush would give a presidential pardon. Doing so would rekindle the long dispute on whether the story of the unmasked CIA agent was a mountain or a mole hill. The mole-hill devotees have argued that Libby was never charged with breaking any national-security law because Wilson's identity was not clearly applicable, and that in Fitzgerald's tenacious pursuit of tangential allegations, the prosecution was politically motivated. Others seeing the case as mountainous have said Libby was the hit man in trying to discredit the CIA employee's husband, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, in retaliation for his public questioning of Bush's justifications for invading Iraq. In any event, Libby's false testimony denying he had leaked the agent's identity led Fitzgerald to prolonged and costly efforts to get reporters to testify that Libby had told them about Plame Wilson. The prosecutor has argued that this history warrants the stiff sentence he has recommended for Libby. Somewhat obscured was the White House disclosure in 2003 that the president on his own had declassified CIA information in a National Intelligence Estimate relating to the Wilsons, authorized Cheney to use it and Libby thereupon passed it on reporters. If so, Bush's action was a clear politicization, legal or not, of classified material at the highest level. Bush early in the case told reporters that anyone in the White House involved in leaking classified information would be dealt with. He apparently sidestepped that issue simply by declassifying the agent's status so it could be disclosed by Libby or anyone else. Plame Wilson continues to be embroiled in a dispute with the CIA. On Thursday, she sued the agency in another federal court for refusing to give clearance to a memoir that Simon and Schuster had planned to publish next fall. The CIA's grounds were that, by disclosing her starting date at the CIA, she had breached the agreement required of employees not to make public details of her agency service. Her lawyers have argued that the information was already in the public domain. In any event, the story of the uncovered CIA agent continues to have legs. Either a stiff sentence for Libby from the judge or no jail time at all can be expected to keep it alive, all the more so should Bush intervene with a pardon that would light a match anew to the whole controversy.

"Fearing the occupying army will continue its searches, harming our Muslim brothers ... (the Islamic State in Iraq) decided to settle the matter and announced the news of their killing to cause bitterness to God's enemies," said a speaker on the video. "The three soldiers were captives, then dead bodies." The 10-minute video carried a picture of the U.S. Army identification cards of Byron Fouty and Alex Jimenez, with the caption: "(President George W.) Bush is the cause of the loss of your captives." The video, posted on Web sites often used by al Qaeda and other Islamists, did not provide clear evidence that the two were dead. In Baghdad, the U.S. military said it was studying the video. "We are further analysing the video, however it doesn't appear to contain any definitive evidence indicating the status of our missing soldiers," Brigadier General Kevin Bergner said in a statement. The U.S. military has carried out an intensive search and found the body of one of the three U.S. soldiers missing after an attack south of Baghdad last month. "As you refuse to hand over the bodies of our killed, we shall not deliver the bodies of your dead," the off-camera speaker said on the video which also showed credit cards and what it said were other belongings of the two soldiers. The U.S. military has said it believed the three had been taken by al Qaeda or others associated with the militant group, after the Islamic State in Iraq group said it was holding the soldiers. The video also showed a group of masked insurgents planning an attack and shaky night footage of what it said was the raid on a U.S. patrol which led to the capture of the three. The insurgent group, formed last year by al Qaeda's wing in Iraq and several smaller Sunni insurgent groups, has claimed responsibility for mass kidnappings and a series of major attacks. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Facts & Figures - Landmine casualties (2004) Nigeria seeks $6.95 bln in new suit against Pfizer Iraq Qaeda group says killed captured U.S. troops Mauritania Islamist suspects were tortured -lawyer Insurgent video shows IDs of missing U.S. soldiers Omega-3 fatty acids reduce blood pressure -study InterAction Statement on President's Renewed AIDS Plan Source: InterAction - USA American Red Cross Promotes Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis Along U.S. - Mexican Border Source: American Red Cross - USA Leader of AJWS Grantee Wins Prestigious Human Rights Award Source: AJWS - USA Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision U.S. Welcomes President's Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA The U.S. commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, speaks during an awarding ceremony for helicopter crews in Camp Anaconda, north of Baghdad June 4, 2007.

Marine Corps officials argue they are enforcing military codes in the case of Cpl. Adam Kokesh. Kokesh, 25, participated in an anti-war protest in Washington in March. When he was identified in a photo caption in The Washington Post, a superior officer sent him an e-mail saying he might have violated a rule prohibiting troops from wearing uniforms without authorization. Kokesh responded with a letter that contained an obscenity. Kokesh is a member of the Individual Ready Reserve, which consists mainly of those who have left active duty but still have time remaining on their eight-year military obligations. His service is due to end June 18, but the Marine Corps is seeking to let him go two weeks early with a less-than-honorable discharge. That could cut some of his health benefits and force him to repay about $10,800 he received to obtain his undergraduate degree on the GI Bill. Kokesh's attorney, Lt. Jeremy Melaragno, said during an administrative separation board hearing that his client's free-speech rights are at stake. "It has everything to do with freedom of speech," Melaragno said. "Ask yourself, would we be here if he was advocating for the Bush administration?" During a break in the hearing, Kokesh told reporters that the case appears to be punitive. "More importantly, it's a case of fraud, waste and abuse and a disgusting waste of government resources," Kokesh said. "While Marines are dying every day in Iraq, they are spending time investigating members of the individual ready reserves for political activity." Kokesh was honorably discharged following a combat tour in Iraq, but he remains part of the Individual Ready Reserve, comprised of those who have left active duty but still have time remaining on their eight-year military obligations. His attorneys said Kokesh was not subject to military rules during the protest because he was not on active duty. They said the protest was a theatrical performance, which meant wearing a uniform was a not a violation of military rules. The military considered it a political event, at which personnel are not allowed to wear their uniforms without authorization. The Marines' first witness, Maj. John R. Whyte, testified Monday he was the officers who wrote Kokesh the e-mail informing him the Marines were investigating the possible uniform violation. On cross examination, the defense had Whyte read a memo he had written on how the Corps should respond to protests. "There should be manpower assigned to search for and remediate misinformation by opposition groups and individuals," he read. Whyte recommended Kokesh's discharge be "other than honorable." Several Kokesh supporters turned out Monday at the Marine Corps Mobilization Command and stood in front of a bus painted with anti-war slogans. Kokesh was a reservist in an artillery unit when he became disillusioned with the war during his first tour. He said he believes there is no way for Iraq to achieve rule of law with a foreign military imposing martial law.

Rice hit out at the shuttering of Radio Caracas Television, RCTV, calling it Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez's "sharpest and most acute" move yet against democracy. Venezuela's top diplomat, Nicolas Maduro, then accused her of hyprocrisy, unacceptable meddling in his nation's affairs and compared the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and secret prisons elsewhere to something not seen since "the time of Hitler." The dispute between Washington and Caracas took center stage at a gathering of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States, a meeting intended to focus on environment and development issues. Rice told reporters en route to Panama that Chavez's closure of RCTV was just the latest and perhaps strongest attack on democracy since coming to power in the late 1990s and pursuing an increasingly anti-U.S. and leftist line. At the meeting, she urged the OAS to send its secretary-general, Jose Miguel Insulza, to Venezuela to look into the closing of the station and deliver a full report on his findings. "Freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of conscience are not a thorn in the side of government," Rice told the ministers. "Disagreeing with your government is not unpatriotic and most certainly should not be a crime in any country, especially a democracy." Maduro, speaking after Rice, reacted angrily, saying her comments were an "unacceptable intervention is the internal affairs of a nation, and that is why we reject it." "Venezuela is asking for respect," he said. "We demand respect for our sovereignty." Maduro defended the decision to close RCTV as "democratic, legal and fair" and accused the United States of repeated violations of human rights, including at the U.S.-Mexico border where immigrants "are chased and hunted like animals" and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he said terrorism suspects are being "held hostage." Rice requested and was given time to rebut Maduro's comments, saying that "issues of democracy and the defense of democracy are never inappropriate" and defending the United States' record on press freedom, noting that media outlets routinely criticize the U.S. government. "I am quite certain that it would be difficult for any commission to debate more fully, to criticize more fully the policies of the United States government than is done every night on CNN, on ABC, on CBS, on NBC and on any number of smaller channels," she said. "That is the point of press freedom," Rice said. "In a democracy the citizens of a country should have the assurance that the policies of their government will be held up for criticism by a free and independent press without the interference of their government. "The citizens of the United States have that assurance, I sincerely hope that the citizens of Venezuela will have that assurance as well," she said to loud applause before leaving the room before Maduro could reply. In response, Maduro lashed out at Rice for leaving the room and kept to his criticism of Guantanamo. "There are hundreds, a disastrous thing comparable only to the time of Hitler, when there were clandestine jails with prisoners who didn't have names. It's monstrous," he said. He suggested that journalists from a new state-funded Venezuelan public television station TVES should be allowed to interview detainees at Guantanamo and renewed a call for a commission to look into the abuses of Latin American immigrants to the United States. "The United States and its government, sooner rather than later, will have to learn to respect the sovereignty of our governments, our people, our new Latin America, our new Caribbean that will never again become a colony," Maduro said, also to applause. It was unclear whether Rice's prediction that the OAS meeting would produce a statement of support for freedom of the press and expression in the Americas. Brazil, Honduras, Guatemala and Chile have expressed support for RCTV and on Monday in Panama, newspapers and a consortium of media groups published ads, saying "Without freedom of expression, there is no liberty, not in Venezuela or any other part of the world." Protests have surfaced at most of Caracas' public and private universities since the opposition-aligned channel RCTV was forced off the air May 27 by Chavez's decision to not renew its license. The demonstrations have spread to other universities nationwide. Most of the Venezuelan news media are in private hands, including many newspapers and radio stations that remain critical of Chavez. But the only other major opposition-sided TV channel is Globovision, and it is not seen in all parts of the country. The populist Chavez has been a source of deep concern for the United States since he took power in the late 1990s and steered the country down an increasingly leftist, anti-U.S. path with close and strong ties with Washington's arch-foe in the America's Fidel Castro of Cuba.

REGISTER-MAIL Caisha Gayles waits with classmates for commencement ceremonies to begin Sunday at Galesburg High School in Galesburg, Ill. Gayles and four other students were denied diplomas after enthusiastic friends or family members cheered for them during commencement. GALESBURG, Ill. &#8211; Caisha Gayles graduated with honors last week, but she still is waiting for her diploma. The reason: the whoops of joy from the audience as she crossed the stage. Gayles was one of five students denied diplomas from the public high school in Galesburg, Ill., after enthusiastic friends or family members cheered for them during commencement. About a month before the May 27 ceremony, Galesburg High students and parents had to sign a contract promising to act in dignified way. Violators were warned they could be denied their diplomas and barred from the after-graduation party. Many schools across the country ask spectators to hold applause and cheers until the end of graduation. But few of them enforce the policy like Galesburg has. &#8220;It was like one of the worst days of my life,&#8221; said Gayles, who had a 3.4 grade-point average and officially graduated, but does not have the keepsake diploma to hang on her wall. &#8220;You walk across the stage and then you can&#8217;t get your diploma because of other people cheering for you. It was devastating, actually.&#8221; School officials in Galesburg, a working-class town of 34,000, said the get-tough policy followed a 2005 ceremony where hoots, hollers and even air horns drowned out much of the ceremony and nearly touched off fights in the audience when the unruly were asked to quiet down. &#8220;Lots of parents complained that they could not hear their own child&#8217;s name called,&#8221; said Joel Estes, Galesburg&#8217;s assistant superintendent. &#8220;And I think that led us to saying we have to do something about this to restore some dignity and honor to the ceremony so that everyone can appreciate it and enjoy it.&#8221; The issue has taken on added controversy with accusations that the students were targeted because of their race: four are black and one is Hispanic. Parents say cheers also erupted for white students, and none of them was denied a diploma. Principal Tom Chiles said administrators who monitored the more than 2,000-seat auditorium reported only disruptions they considered &#8220;significant,&#8221; and all turned in the same five names. School officials said they will hear students and parents out if they appeal. Meanwhile, the school said the five students still can get their diplomas by completing eight hours of public service work, answering phones, sorting books or doing other chores for the district, situated about 150 miles southwest of Chicago. Gayles&#8217; mother said she plans to fight the school board &#8211; in court if necessary &#8211; to get her daughter&#8217;s diploma. The noise &#8220;was like three seconds. It was like, &#8216;Yay,&#8217; and that was it,&#8221; Carolyn Gayles said. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Carhart. The ruling held a federal ban on so-called "partial-birth abortion" as constitutional unless this procedure was essential to preserve a woman's life. Activists in the pro-life camp regarded the decision as a victory, one of the few enjoyed by abortion foes since 1973 when Roe v. Wade held laws allowing abortion do not violate the Constitution. Unfortunately, the rhetoric and political posturing surrounding "partial-birth abortion" have done little to further a meaningful discussion regarding the place of abortion in our society. The term "partial-birth abortion" was crafted by pro-life advocates as an evocative description of a procedure otherwise known as dilation and extraction, used to terminate pregnancies in the late second and third trimesters. The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 claimed "factual findings" established a "moral, medical and ethical consensus" that "D&X" was a "gruesome and inhuman procedure." Speaking as a doctor, the aforementioned "consensus" is fabrication. Space constraints prevent vivid descriptions of D&X and an alternative procedure still regarded as legal, dilation and evacuation, D&E. Either procedure can qualify as "gruesome" with D&E offering more potential risk to the mother. Truth be told, the debate between the relative merits of D&E versus D&X has little to do with the underlying purpose of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban. This legislation and similar efforts, such as the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act, are components of the long-range strategy created by abortion opponents to ultimately overturn Roe v. Wade and allow individual states to determine the legality of abortion within their borders. Abortion supporters fully understand the intent of their adversaries. Given the makeup of the Supreme Court and the knowledge that one of its four remaining liberals is 87-year-old Justice John Paul Stevens, their fears regarding the demise of abortion rights may have some justification. Advocates of abortion rights realize a consensus will never be established regarding when a fetus becomes a human being. Horror stories of women dying from illegal septic abortions or unwanted children marginalized by society provoke accusations of moral relativism from abortion foes and are dismissed as irrelevant. The right of "choice" is also ridiculed by conservatives. However, given the traditional place of women in our society and their susceptibility to violence and oppression by males, the argument granting the right of "choice" to terminate a pregnancy inflicted on a woman has merit. Also, one can justify abortion to preserve a woman's health throughout the course of pregnancy. The issue of preserving health may be the most vexing to pro-life activists. Abortion may be performed prior to fetal viability and whenever pregnancy presents a health risk. Abortion opponents argue this latter parameter allows abortion to be "legal at any time, for any reason." It is easy for abortion foes to sound righteous on this issue, but they do not occupy the moral high ground. A substantial number of these individuals are hardly pro-life and exhibit their own brand of moral relativism given their positions on other matters, such as the environment, gun control, government-provided social services, homosexuality and U.S. military activity. Also, many abortion adversaries regard abstinence as the single acceptable method of contraception, a completely unrealistic position that can only foster more unwanted pregnancies. There are two facts regarding abortion in the United States that neither side of the debate wants to consider together. First, the majority of us support use of abortion in some restricted fashion. Second, the United States, as compared with other Western countries such as Finland, France, and Germany, has some of the least restrictive abortion regulations. Rectifying the above realities through frank discussion of the appropriate limits of this procedure would require each camp to appreciate its own fallibilities and drop its all-or-nothing positions. The controversy surrounding the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act did nothing to promote this discussion. The focal point of the abortion issue, the life of the fetus versus the right of the pregnant woman and her physician to terminate a pregnancy, represents a complex, emotionally charged dilemma that is difficult to solve in a pragmatic fashion. Unfortunately, as each side in the abortion war has some validity to their arguments, our society cannot reach a consensus as to which position is more principled. Given the above, a middle ground has to be established that allows the concerns of each faction to be heard and addressed. Perhaps then, with time, we will discover the most moral solution. This is the opinion of St. Cloud resident Dave Shuster.

Thompson in Richmond, Va., Saturday. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: June 3, 2007 RICHMOND, Va., June 2  In a preview of the themes he is likely to emphasize in a presidential campaign, tossed some red meat to here Saturday night, assailing the bill in Congress and warning of a mushroom cloud he said radicals around the world were waiting to see rise over the United States. Skip to next paragraph Excerpts From Fred D. Thompson's Speech in Virginia ( The TV Watch: In Casting for President, Will Actor Rate a Callback? Stir in G.O.P. as Ex-Senator Moves to Run The latest political news from around the nation. But Mr. Thompson spoke in a soft Southern cadence, weaving in his biography as a homespun, small-town lawyer with a belief in basic principles and a desire to bring people together. Mr. Thompson, 64, a former senator from Tennessee, has all but announced that he will be announcing his candidacy for president, probably within several weeks. He filed preliminary papers on Friday that allow him to start raising money and hiring staff. He did not directly address his intentions here Saturday, but he made several allusions about the country needing new leadership and said at one point in his 35-minute speech, Were going to cut some new ground over the next year or so. In a brief interview afterward, he said he was just testing the waters, but added, The waters feel pretty warm, to tell you the truth. Mr. Thompsons appearance at the event, a previously scheduled fund-raising dinner for the Virginia Republican Party, was his first since he and his supporters indicated a few days ago that he was preparing to enter the race. His supporters say he can fill what they see as a void for a true conservative who can also get elected. The speech was both a call to arms and a declaration to conservatives that he is one of them. Mr. Thompson paid homage to Barry Goldwater as his political inspiration. He denounced the so-called death tax. He took a swipe at Democrats for what he said was hanging out a surrender sign in the war in Iraq. Believe it or not, we still have many friends around the world, Mr. Thompson said. But he said those friends needed convincing that this is a battle between the forces of civilization and the forces of evil and weve got to choose sides. He was short on specifics, offering instead a broad conservative approach toward smaller government, lower taxes and a bigger defense budget. It was his views on immigration that brought the diners to their feet with sustained applause. Youve got to secure the border first before you do anything else, he said, adding, This is our home, and we get to decide who comes into our home. Supporters have said Mr. Thompsons plan is to become the plausible alternative to the 10 Republicans who are already running for president but have failed to excite the broad base of conservatives who dominate the partys primaries. At the same time, he wants to appear nonthreatening to general-election voters. The Republican candidates include Senator of Arizona, long a Thompson ally, who helped draw up the immigration bill currently under debate in Congress. Mr. Thompson, who spent eight years in the Senate, took several jabs at Washington, where he still lives. Referring to his acting career, he said he had left the Senate because after eight years in Washington, I longed for the realism and sincerity of Hollywood. More Articles in National &#x00bb; Love the Op-Ed columnists?  Try TimesSelect free for 14-days.

Jefferson Indicted in Bribery Probe Jury Indicts Jefferson in Bribery Probe Grand Jury Indicts Rep. Jefferson in Bribery Investigation Louisiana Congressman, William Jefferson, D-New Orleans, left, and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, appear before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development meeting in New Orleans Friday afternoon Jan. 13, 2006. The subcommittee came to New Orleans to discussing the housing problems caused by Hurricane Katrina. &#40;Bill Haber/ AP Photo &#41; By LARA JAKES JORDAN Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON Jun 4, 2007 (AP) Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., was indicted Monday on federal charges of racketeering, soliciting bribes and money-laundering in a long-running bribery investigation into business deals he tried to broker in Africa. The indictment handed up in federal court in Alexandria., Va., Monday is 94 pages long and lists 16 alleged violations of federal law that could keep Jefferson in prison for up to 235 years. He is charged with racketeering, soliciting bribes, wire fraud, money-laundering, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Jefferson is accused of soliciting bribes for himself and his family, and also for bribing a Nigerian official. Almost two years ago, in August 2005, investigators raided Jefferson's home in Louisiana and found $90,000 in cash stuffed into a box in his freezer. Jefferson, 63, whose Louisiana district includes New Orleans, has said little about the case publicly but has maintained his innocence. He was re-elected last year despite the looming investigation. Jefferson, in Louisiana on Monday, could not immediately be reached for comment. Two of Jefferson's associates have already struck plea bargains with prosecutors and have been sentenced. Brett Pfeffer, a former congressional aide, admitted soliciting bribes on Jefferson's behalf and was sentenced to eight years in prison. Another Jefferson associate, Louisville, Ky., telecommunications executive Vernon Jackson, pleaded guilty to paying between $400,000 and $1 million in bribes to Jefferson in exchange for his assistance securing business deals in Nigeria and other African nations. Jackson was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. Both Pfeffer and Jackson agreed to cooperate in the case against Jefferson in exchanges for their pleas. The impact of the case has stretched across continents and even roiled presidential politics in Nigeria. According to court records, Jefferson told associates that he needed cash to pay bribes to the country's vice president, Atiku Abubakar.

No one on the ground was hurt when the twin-engine Piper Seneca came to rest atop a garage, said Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane was approaching Cable Airport about 45 miles east of Los Angeles when it lost power and crashed into three homes. None caught fire. The plane departed from Van Nuys Airport about 50 miles northwest from Upland. "They were on approach when the pilot reported engine problems," Gregor said. Weather didn't appear to be a factor. It was sunny with no clouds or fog. Housing tracts surround the small airport. A plane crashed into a home in nearby Claremont on Dec. 14, 2003, killing the pilot.

Kelly said the terrorists were plotting to blow up a 40-mile pipeline that takes fuel from a facility in Linden, New Jersey through Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens to the JFK airport. Experts appearing on broadcast television said the terrorists plot to destroy the JFK airport by blowing up the pipeline was foiled, but their fantastic vision of the ensuing explosion wiping out everything was more like a science fiction movie than reality, claiming the destruction would have been contained and most of the damage localized. The FBI has arrested three of the suspects in the JFK bomb plot, a fourth is still at large in Guyana. The US Department of Justice for the Eastern District of New York said two of the four suspects included a former member of the parliament of Guyana and a former airport cargo worker at the airport. Russell Defreitas is a former JFK employee who was arrested in Brooklyn. Abdul Kadir served as a member of the Guyanese Parliament and is now in custody in Guyana. Two other men, Kareem Ibrahim of Trinidad, is in custody in Trinidad and will likely be extradited to the U.S. after court hearings. A fourth man, Abdel Nur of Guyana is still being sought by authorities there. Authorities in Trinidad and Tobago say Kadir and Nur are longtime associates of a Trinidadian radical Muslim group, Jamaat al Muslimeen, which launched an unsuccessful rebellion in 1990 that left 24 dead. The United States plans to seek their extradition. Commissioner Kelly said that authorities need to pay closer attention to the Caribbean as an area that needs more focus from counterterrorism officials. The Justice Department said the plot tapped into an international network of Muslim extremists from the United States, Guyana, and Trinidad. A Muslim informant helped U.S. authorities foil the plot. His identity has not been revealed. The four began plotting to blow up JFK airport in January, 2006, according to the criminal complaint. The terrorists were allegedly plotting to destroy buildings, fuel tanks, and fuel pipelines at JFK airport with explosives. JFK handles on average over 1,000 flights daily, approximately half of which are international flights, and handles annually, approximately 45 million passengers and over 1.5 million tons of cargo with an estimated value of $120 billion. The fuel supply for these operations are linked primarily to the Buckeye Pipeline, which distributes fuel and other petroleum products to various sites in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens, New York, among others. In tapped conversations, the ex-JFK employee, Defreitas, was recorded saying, "the attacks would result in the destruction of the whole of Kennedy, that only a few people would survive the attack, and that because of the location of the targeted fuel pipelines, part of Queens would explode." Kadir and Nur were supposedly reaching out to other terrorist organizations in South America and the Caribbean in the hopes of pulling together more support in attacking the United States when authorities swooped in to arrest the members of the terrorist cell. The FBI said that one of the contacts was a senior leader of the Jamaat Al Muslimeen (JAM) terrorist group. Mark J. Mershon, Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office, stated, &ldquo;The defendants had the connections to present their terrorist plot to radical groups in South America and the Caribbean." Mershon went on to say, " Kadir and Nur were longtime associates of JAM leaders. Kareem was also preparing to send an emissary overseas to present the plan to extremist networks there when law enforcement stepped in to disrupt it." According to FBI tapes of the defendants, Defreitas exulted over JFK airport's symbolic importance saying, "Anytime you hit Kennedy, it is the most hurtful thing to the United States. If you hit that, this whole country will be in mourning. It's like you can kill the man twice." In a later recorded conversation with his coconspirators in May 2007, Defreitas compared the plot to attack JFK airport to the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, stating, "even the Twin Towers can't touch it," adding that, "this can destroy the economy of America for some time." In discussing the plans, Kadir stressed the goal of causing economic damage and suggested minimizing the killing of innocent men and women. In one conversation, Kadir and Defreitas discussed the need to disable the airport control tower from which airport security monitors the fuel tank locations. Kadir, an engineer by training, explained that the tanks were, most likely, double tanks, requiring two explosions to provide enough oxygen to ignite the fuel inside the inner tank. Kenneth L. Wainstein, Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Justice Department credited authorities cooperative work in foiling the JFK airport bomb plot to that of the Fort Dixon terrorist plot several weeks ago, saying, "this plot highlights the evolving nature of the terrorist threat we face, and our investigation into both plots highlights how our agents and prosecutors are refining their capability to detect and pre-empt such plots before they advance to a dangerous stage." Roslynn R. Mauskopf said, "Had the plot been carried out, it could have resulted in unfathomable damage, deaths, and destruction." The four terrorists face life behind bars without the possibility of parole if convicted, Mauskopf added.

The plane was diverted to Oakland after crew noticed an emergency light indicating a problem with the landing gear. Flight 3050 was traveling to San Diego from Sacramento. During the investigation, the jet sat on the runway for nearly 9 hours. A spokeswoman for Southwest (NYSE: LUV) says the cause of the landing gear failure is not known.

The reason: the whoops of joy from the audience as she crossed the stage. Ex-FSB colonel Alexander Litvinenko's poisoning stirs up international scandal USA and Russia start new arms race Russia tests new missiles to subdue US air defense Fashion model Petra Nemcova: Fragile hottie nearly killed by Asian Tsunami 2004 Gayles was one of five students denied diplomas from the lone public high school in Galesburg after enthusiastic friends or family members cheered for them during commencement. About a month before the May 27 ceremony, students and their parents had to sign a contract promising to act in dignified way. Violators were warned they could be denied their diplomas and barred from the after-graduation party. Many schools across the country ask spectators to hold applause and cheers until the end of graduation. But few of them enforce the policy with what some in Galesburg say are strong-arm tactics. "It was like one of the worst days of my life," said Gayles, who had a 3.4 grade-point average and officially graduated, but does not have the keepsake diploma to hang on her wall. "You walk across the stage and then you can't get your diploma because of other people cheering for you. It was devastating, actually." School officials in Galesburg, a working-class town of 34,000 that is still reeling from the 2004 shutdown of a 1,600-employee refrigerator factory, said the get-tough policy followed a 2005 commencement where hoots, hollers and even air horns drowned out much of the ceremony and nearly touched off fights in the audience when the unruly were asked to quiet down. "Lots of parents complained that they could not hear their own child's name called," said Joel Estes, Galesburg's assistant superintendent. "And I think that led us to saying we have to do something about this to restore some dignity and honor to the ceremony so that everyone can appreciate it and enjoy it." In Indianapolis, public school officials this year started kicking out parents and relatives who cheer. At one school, the superintendent interrupted last month's graduation to order police to remove a woman from the gymnasium. "It's an important, solemn occasion. There's plenty of time for celebration before and after," said Clarke Campbell, president of the Indianapolis school board. In Galesburg, the issue has taken on added controversy with accusations that the students were targeted because of their race: four are black and one is Hispanic. Parents say cheers also erupted for white students, and none of them was denied a diploma. Principal Tom Chiles said administrators who monitored the more than 2,000-seat auditorium reported only disruptions they considered "significant," and all turned in the same five names.

(AP) - A federal appeals court ruled today that Michigan's law aimed at banning a controversial abortion procedure is unconstitutional. The Detroit-based Sixth US Circuit Court of Appeals says Michigan should have copied a similar Ohio law outlawing partial-birth abortion that was upheld by the Sixth Circuit in 2003. The three-judge panel says Michigan's law pushes beyond boundaries set by the US Supreme Court. The judges agreed with a district judge's opinion that Michigan's Legal Birth Definition Act places an "undue burden" on a woman's right to choose an abortion. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press.

The body of a California soldier later was found, but soldiers from Michigan and Massachusetts remain missing. The Washington-based SITE Institute said it had obtained the 10-minute, 41-second video that shows the planning stages and kidnapping operation as well as footage from after the attack. The institute, which monitors militant websites, said the video also shows the identification cards of two of the soldiers. A prominent Islamic website said in a banner headline that it soon would show the video, but it was not yet posted. The three U.S. soldiers were captured west of Baghdad on May 12 in an ambush later claimed by an insurgent umbrella group, the Islamic State of Iraq, which includes Al Qaeda in Iraq. The body of one of the soldiers was found on May 23 in the Euphrates River and later identified by the U.S. military as Pfc. Joseph Anzack Jr., 20, of Torrance, Calif. The two other soldiers &ndash; Spc. Alex R. Jimenez, 25, of Lawrence, Mass., and Pvt. Byron W. Fouty, 19, of Waterford Township, Mich. &ndash; remain missing. The three are from the 10th Mountain Division based out of Fort Drum, N.Y. A Fouty family friend said the military briefed Fouty&#39;s father, Mick Fouty, about the video on Saturday night. &#34;From what I hear, it shows the soldier&#39;s uniforms and dog tags and warns the U.S. to back off on the search,&#34; Cathy Conger said. Byron Fouty lived with her family in Oakland County&#39;s Commerce Township for 14 months before he left for Iraq. &#34;What it does not show one way or another is if they&#39;re alive or not,&#34; Conger said. &#34;I just feel really bad about it. I hope that he&#39;s still alive. My prayers are with him.&#39;&#39; Fouty&#39;s stepfather, Gordon Dibler of Oxford, Mich., said the military told him Saturday that the video showed personal identification items from the soldiers. &#34;They prepared me in a very proper and considerate way,&#34; he told WWJ-AM.

The head of Canada&#8217;s defense, General Rick Hillier said at a Federation of Canadian municipalities conference over the weekend that applications have already hit above the 12,000 mark this spring - well above the established targets. He also said the recruitment process has been substantially streamlined too, getting some recruits into uniforms in just five days. As a result, some 35,000 people have joined the military in the last year, up from 25,000 from the previous year. But as far as the mission is concerned, he was firm to say the mission to Afghanistan was only temporary but could have great potential in the future. &#8220;The best estimate is that 55 percent of the population is less than 14 years of age. Can you imagine the potential if you can keep those kids alive and educate them and give them some hope for the future?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Afghan people don&#8217;t want a handout &#8212; they just want help in the short term and they want to rebuild their own country.&#8221; Small Plane Crashes In Upland, Calif Upland (eCanadaNow) - A small plane carrying three people crashed in to a group of homes in Upland California Monday All three passengers were treated for minor injuries.

A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal said the Michigan Legislature would have been "virtually guaranteed" a favorable result on appeal had it copied an Ohio law that the 6th Circuit already has upheld. "It instead opted to use statutory language that pushed almost every boundary that the Supreme Court has imposed for these types of laws," the judges said. Previous attempts by Michigan lawmakers to stop the procedure were struck down by federal courts in 1997 and 2001. The U.S. Supreme Court in April upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, with the majority opinion carefully distinguishing the controversial procedure from a more common abortion method used in the second trimester of pregnancy. The latter was unaffected by the ruling. The appeals panel affirmed a Detroit district judge's opinion that the 2004 Legal Birth Definition Act in Michigan places an "undue burden" on a woman's right to have an abortion. Abortion rights groups have said the law - unlike the federal ban and the law in Ohio - overreached and would have banned pre-viable abortions, including the most common method of second-trimester abortion. The appeals court agreed. "The Michigan statute contains no similar exception or clear definitions that would avoid sweeping up protected abortion procedures within its prohibition," the court wrote. The Michigan Legislature approved the abortion law in June 2004. Hundreds of thousands of voters signed petitions that allowed the bill to become law with only the approval of the House and Senate - both of which were controlled by Republicans at the time - after Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm vetoed it.

Published June 2, 2007 Michael Hidalgo, of Lakeland takes cover under his umbrella as he exits the St. Petersburg Pier Friday afternoon. [Times photo: Scott Keeler] Well, we need the rain, right? Tropical Storm Barry brought wet, windy weather to the Tampa Bay area Friday evening, and is expected to do more of the same today. Early Saturday morning, Barry was headed northeast at nearly 10 mph, with maximum winds measured at nearly 50 mph. It was expected to weaken today, said Dave Roberts, a specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The storm formed on the first day of what forecasters are predicting will be an active hurricane season. Barry could make landfall as early as this afternoon anywhere from the Tampa Bay area to the Panhandle. The tropical storm warning for Barry stretches up the Gulf Coast from Bonita Beach to Keaton Beach in the Big Bend. Local emergency management officials seemed most worried Friday night about the high tide this afternoon around 2:30 and a potential 3- to 5-foot storm surge. "We&#39;re just beefing our staff up by a couple people," said Rich Mason, the supervisor of Pinellas County Emergency Communications in Clearwater. "Hopefully it&#39;ll be just a rain event and that&#39;ll be it. The Hurricane Center is expecting dangerous waves, coastal flooding of up to 5 feet and rainfall of up to 6 inches from the Keys to southeast Georgia. The National Weather Service in Ruskin says the rain should clear this afternoon. "I got people on standby if needed," said Pasco County Emergency Management director Jim Martin. The National Weather Service expects 13 to 17 named storms this year. Seven of them could become hurricanes, forecasters say, and three to five of those could turn severe. The first named storm of the year formed more than three weeks ago. Subtropical Storm Andrea developed about 150 miles northeast of Daytona Beach. The weather sparked several transformer fires in Pinellas County on Friday evening that left 11,000 customers without power. Most of the power was restored within a few hours. The organizers of a Taste of Pinellas canceled the first evening of the weekend-long event in Vinoy Park, and activity in downtown St. Petersburg seemed slower than on a typical Friday night. But Jonny Lang still played in the courtyard in Jannus Landing, and people were sitting at tables outside under overhangs at the Havana Room and the Independent. In Tampa, Hillsborough County Emergency Management was not expecting to have to order any evacuations, open any shelters, or activate the Emergency Operations Center, according to agency spokeswoman Holley Wade. Same deal in Pinellas, Pasco and Hernando counties. Pasco&#39;s Hurricane Expo, scheduled for 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. today at Gulfview Square Mall in Port Richey, was still on. Hernando&#39;s Hurricane Expo, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., was still on as well. Just in time for Barry. "It&#39;s something you need to watch," said Pasco&#39;s Martin. "It doesn&#39;t appear to be a wind event. It appears to be a potential surge event." "The high tide will be the only issue," said Tom Leto, the emergency management director in Hernando County. Friday night at the Publix downtown in St. Petersburg? Business as usual. Same at the Home Depot on N Dale Mabry Highway in Tampa. Assistant manager Lee Goodman said the store was fully stocked with hurricane supplies. "We sold a few generators and a lot of the weather radios, but nothing like a blitz now," he said. If Barry remains a tropical storm, it would be one of the earliest named storms to make landfall in the United States since the Hurricane Center began keeping track. Tropical Storm Allison made landfall at St. Teresa on June 5, 1995, after it formed in the gulf two days earlier as a hurricane and then lost speed. Other early storms: Tropical Storm Arlene, which hit just west of Pensacola on June 10, 2005, and Tropical Storm Alberto, which made landfall about 50 miles southeast of Tallahassee on June 13 of last year. Pinellas interim emergency management director Sally Bishop said Barry was a wake-up call to be ready for this hurricane season. "This is already the second storm of the season so far," Leto said. "It only takes one." Times staff writers Rebecca Catalanello and Anne Lindberg contributed to this report, which used information from the Associated Press.

(AP) &#151; Louisiana is on track to become the first state to outlaw a rare late-term abortion procedure, following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld a federal ban. A state Senate committee is expected to debate two bills this week that would ban so-called "partial birth" abortions, a surgical procedure that has become the center of angry debate between pro-choice and anti-abortion forces. Other states are expected to consider similar bans, though Louisiana is the first to take action on legislation. A bill to criminalize the procedure has been introduced in Michigan's Legislature, but lawmakers have not acted on it. Supporters of a ban in Louisiana call the procedure barbaric, and said they hope the Supreme Court's ruling is an indication that the nation's high court is moving toward overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that makes abortion legal. Rep. Danny Martiny, R-Kenner, said Louisiana needs a partial-birth ban in addition to the federal ban. "I think it is important for this state, if we believe this is illegal, that we not rely on the federal government, which might have other priorities," said Martiny, chair of the House Criminal Justice Committee. The Louisiana measures appear to have little or no opposition, despite complaints from pro-choice groups who said a state ban is pointless. The House unanimously approved one measure, by Rep. Gary Beard, R-Baton Rouge. That bill and another, by Sen. Ben Nevers, D-Bogalusa, will be debated this week in the Senate's health committee, Nevers said. Anti-abortion activists call the procedure partial-birth abortion and doctors call it "dilation and extraction." It involves partially removing the fetus intact from a woman's uterus, then crushing or cutting its skull to complete the abortion. The procedure is rare, though pro-choice and anti-abortion groups disagree over how often it's performed. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research center on reproductive health, 1.3 million abortions were performed in 2000 nationwide. Of those, 2,200 were partial-birth procedures, the group said. La.

LOUIS, Mo. -- A federal appeals court rules that Missouri&#39;s three-drug method of execution is not unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. The decision allows Missouri to renew execution of condemned inmates. The case filed on behalf of condemned killer Michael Taylor had effectively halted Missouri executions by lethal injection since early last year. The 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a ruling by federal judge Fernando Gaitan Junior in Kansas City. He who ordered reforms to Missouri&#39;s lethal injection procedures, including the use of a doctor specializing in anesthesia. So far, the state has been unable to find one willing to participate in executions. Missouri is among nine states that have put executions on hold as they grapple with whether lethal injection is inhumane. (Copyright 2007 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)

The FBI's Top Ten Art Crimes List Review of the PayPal Security Key The Justice Department will dispatch federal agents to Mesa, Ariz., Orlando, Fla., San Bernardino, Calif., and San Juan, Puerto Rico, to help slow down crime. The federal agents will combat the increase in murder, guns and gangs. The federal agents were dispatched Friday, June 1st by the Justice Department, as reported by the This is the second year in a row that the violent crime is up. In 2005 there was a 2.3 percent rise in violent crime and a 1.3 percent rise in 2006 regarding violence offenses. There was also a 6 percent rise in robberies as well as a significant rise in homicide as reported by the Associated Press. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told the Associated Press, "Each of these cities has seen an unacceptable increase in homicides or other violent crimes." With the critics hounding Gonzales to resign over the recent firings of U.S. Attorneys, Gonzales told the Associated Press that he would spend his final 18 months of his tenure "in a sprint" to curb the violent crime. As of Sunday, ATF Violent Crime Impact Teams are in 29 cities. The FBI, which has 180 Safe Streets Task Forces all around the country, is sending one to which has been engulfed with gang violence recently. Barbara Jones a spokeswoman for the Department told the Associated Press that the department "welcomes any additional federal support in our efforts to combat violent crime." Justice officials have made it perfectly clear that there are no additional funds or grants are going to be given to communities to bolster their own law enforcement efforts. Gonzales is also hoping for new laws that strengthen the penalties against criminals. He also would like to see a mandatory minimum sentence on federal convicts, the Associated Press reported. Between 2003 and 2006, Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine's report showed that in 256 cities all across the nation, 210 Justice Department task forces were working. ATF Director Michael J. Sullivan told the Associated Press that each of the Violent Crime Impact Teams cost 1.5 million dollars in personnel, expenses and equipment. He is also hoping that since the recent budget cuts, Sullivan is hoping that with the new teams comes money and bodies. Although violent crime did go up, property crimes such as burglary, car theft and arson dropped. The official FBI data is set to be released Monday, June 4, as reported by the Associated Press.

The scathing attack by Mohamed ElBaradei were swiftly dismissed by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who accused the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief of "muddying the message." "I wake every morning and see 100 Iraqis, innocent civilians, are dying," ElBaradei said in an interview for BBC Radio. "I have no brief other than to make sure we don't go into another war or that we go crazy into killing each other. You do not want to give additional argument to new crazies who say 'let's go and bomb Iran,'" he said in a documentary, excerpts from which were published on the BBC's Web site in advance. He said a nuclear-armed Iran would be terrible but added that the jury was still out as to whether the country even wanted atomic weapons. He warned that one could not "bomb knowledge." Asked who the "new crazies" were, he replied: "Those who have extreme views and say the only solution is to impose your will by force." It was ElBaradei's strongest warning yet against the use of force. To question the value of binding UN resolutions was unacceptable, Rice said, alluding to ElBaradei's remarks. Exploratory talks between the EU's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, and top Iranian negotiator Ali Larijani on Thursday yielded no breakthrough on the core dispute - Iran's refusal to suspend enrichment as a condition for negotiations. On arrival in Madrid, Rice said: "The only question is: are we getting to a point where the Iranians are prepared to suspend [sensitive nuclear work] so that negotiations can begin?" "I don't see any evidence of it but I frankly haven't had a chance to speak to Javier [Solana] since the talks concluded," she added. But a spokeswoman for Solana said Friday Iran pledged to end years of stonewalling and provide answers on past suspicious activities to the IAEA. "Iran is ready to discuss outstanding questions with the agency which are linked to information access and cooperation with the agency," she said. "This is the first time they made such a serious offer" without preconditions, a UN official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The official said, without elaborating, that Larijani had offered "a short timetable" for providing the answers sought by the IAEA. Rice rebuked ElBaradei after talks in Madrid with Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. "We have a diplomatic choice ... that is only going to succeed if we are absolutely clear with the Iranians, not muddying the message in any way," she said. "If we are absolutely clear that Iran's obligation is to live up to Security Council resolutions that have been passed, that means to suspend their activities on enrichment and reprocessing, that means to enter negotiations on a package of incentives and a civil nuclear program that would be compliant with the international community's demands. "But we aren't going to get to that favorable diplomatic outcome if we muddy the message for the Iranians. The Iranians need to hear it loud and clear. They are hearing it loud and clear from the Security Council," she said. "They are hearing it loud and clear from the international community. I expect them to hear it loud and clear from the IAEA and from its director." Rice, asked whether hawkish Vice President Dick Cheney wanted an attack against Iran, said President George W. Bush had made clear Washington was sticking to a diplomatic course. "But it is a diplomatic course that is backed up by disincentives for Iran to continue its activities." she added. Adding pressure on the Islamic Republic on a different front, Bush on Friday strongly condemned Tehran's detention of American citizens and called for them to be freed "immediately and unconditionally." Tehran has accused dual US-Iranian citizens Haleh Esfandiari, an academic, Kian Tajbakhsh, a social scientist, and Parnaz Azima, a journalist, of espionnage. The State Department said on Thursday that a fourth Iranian-American, California businessman Ali Shakeri had also been detained. "Their presence in Iran - to visit their parents or to conduct humanitarian work - poses no threat," Bush said in a statement. "I strongly condemn their detention at the hands of Iranian authorities. They should be freed immediately and unconditionally," Bush said. Bush also demanded to know the whereabouts of Robert Levinson, a former FBI official who went missing in early March while on a visit to the Iranian island of Kish. - Tags: Bush, Iran, Iraq, Negotiation, Nuclear, Official, Resolution, Tehran, War Send to a friend Save to My Web Your feedback is important to us!

The airline made the emergency landing after reporting problems with it's landing gear when it took off from Sacramento. None of the 119 passengers or crew aboard Southwest Flight 3050 were reported injured. (Sean Connelley/The Oakland Tribune) OAKLAND &#151; A Southwest Airlines flight en route to San Diego made an emergency landing at Oakland International Airport on Sunday, closing the main runway after the jet's front landing gear collapsed. The plane landed about 3:30 p.m. after it experienced problems with the landing gear. No injuries were reported and Southwest and airport officials said all 114 passengers were sent on their way out of Oakland within hours. "All of the customers have been accommodated," said Frank Guistiani, a Southwest station director. "They're on their way to their final destinations." Southwest officials did not have information on how the crew communicated with the passengers during the emergency nor on how old the plane was. They did say that Flight 3050 left Sacramento at At some point, the Boeing 737's crew decided to divert the plane to Oakland after receiving indications there were problems with the front landing gear. They requested a flyby and had the air traffic controller in Oakland look at the gear to see what was wrong. The crew opted to make an emergency landing rather than continue on to San Diego. The airliner's front landing gear collapsed upon landing, leaving the plane stranded on the runway. At last check, the runway was expected to remain closed until 6 a.m. today as crews are planning to use a crane to move the plane. Passengers and crew were evacuated safely from the plane, Southwest officials said, using a rear emergency slide to deboard. The Oakland Fire Department responded to secure the scene.

In a news conference on Friday, Ms. Rice maintained that Mr. Cheney supported her strategy of trying to deal with Iran&#8217;s nuclear ambitions through diplomacy. A senior Bush administration official separately denied that there was a deep divide between Ms. Rice and Mr. Cheney on Iran. But, the official said, &#8220;The vice president is not necessarily responsible for every single thing that comes out of the mouth of every single member of his staff.&#8221; The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about any divide within the administration. The reports about hawkish statements by members of Mr. Cheney&#8217;s staff first surfaced last week in The Washington Note, an influential blog put out by Steve Clemons of the left-leaning New America Foundation. The reports have alarmed European diplomats, some of whom fear that the struggle over Iran&#8217;s nuclear program may evolve into a decision by the Bush administration to resort to force against Iran. In interviews, people who have spoken with Mr. Cheney&#8217;s staff have confirmed the broad outlines of the reports, and said that some of the hawkish statements to outsiders had been made by David Wurmser, a former Pentagon official who is now the principal deputy assistant to Mr. Cheney for national security affairs. The accounts were provided by people who expressed alarm about the statements, but refused to be quoted by name. &#8220;The vice president and his staff fully support the president&#8217;s position on Iran&#8221; a spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney, Megan McGinn, said. During an interview with BBC Radio broadcast Friday, , the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , said he did not want to see another war like the one still raging in Iraq four years after the American-led invasion there. &#8220;You do not want to give additional argument to new crazies who say, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go and bomb Iran,&#8217; &#8221; Dr. ElBaradei said. &#8220;I wake up every morning and see 100 Iraqis, innocent civilians, are dying.&#8221; Dr. ElBaradei, who has urged Western powers to consider allowing Iran limited uranium enrichment on its own territory, is already facing criticism from Bush administration officials who say he should stick to monitoring Iran&#8217;s nuclear program and leave diplomatic policy to the six countries that have banded together to confront Tehran&#8217;s ambitions. But several Western European officials echoed his concern, and said privately that they were worried that Mr. Cheney&#8217;s &#8220;red line&#8221; &#151; the point at which he believed Iran was on the brink of acquiring a nuclear weapon and a military strike was necessary &#151; may be coming soon. &#8220;We fully believe that Foggy Bottom is committed to the diplomatic track,&#8221; one European official said Wednesday, referring the State Department. &#8220;But there&#8217;s some concern about the vice president&#8217;s office.&#8221; Dr. ElBaradei told the BBC that one could not &#8220;bomb knowledge.&#8221; Asked who the &#8220;new crazies&#8221; were, he said, &#8220;Those who have extreme views and say the only solution is to impose our will by force.&#8221; Exactly one year ago on Friday, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, Germany and France offered a package of incentives to Iran if it stopped enriching uranium, which Iran maintains is for peaceful purposes but which the West believes is directed toward a nuclear weapons program. Iran rejected the offer, and the United Nations Security Council has since passed two sets of sanctions aimed at forcing that country&#8217;s governing religious leadership to change its mind. Ms. Rice was the one who prodded Mr. Bush last year to offer to reverse 27 years of American policy and join European talks with Iran over its nuclear program, provided that Iran suspended its enrichment of uranium. Some conservative hawks in the administration have privately expressed doubt that the diplomatic course would yield much. Last week, the atomic energy agency issued a report detailing Iran&#8217;s progress in enriching uranium, and said that Iran had 1,300 centrifuges running during a surprise inspection in May. The report did say that Iran had fed only 260 kilograms of uranium hexafluoride into the machines for enrichment over the past few months, suggesting that the centrifuges were running quite slowly. But American officials have nonetheless called the report &#8220;alarming&#8221; because Iran is closing in on the 3,000 centrifuges needed to make a nuclear bomb. Ms. Rice, traveling through Europe this week, refused to say where her &#8220;red line&#8221; is on Iran, and, when asked, maintained that she intended to continue to pursue the diplomatic course with Iran. In Madrid on Friday for a brief stop to try to mend the Bush administration&#8217;s tattered relations with Spain&#8217;s Socialist government, Ms. Rice was asked whether she could assure that Mr. Cheney did not want to use military action to deal with Iran. &#8220;The most powerful set of disincentives that we have now are the collateral effects of Iran being under a Security Council resolution, which has made the private sector think twice about the investment and reputational risk of getting involved with Iran,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will tell you what will help to get us to a place where we don&#8217;t have an unpalatable choice,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We do have a choice, we have a diplomatic choice.&#8221; Bush Demands Iran Free Detainees WASHINGTON, June 1 (AP) &#151; President Bush demanded Friday that Iran &#8220;immediately and unconditionally&#8221; release four Iranian-Americans detained for alleged espionage, and provide information about a former &#8220;I strongly condemn their detention at the hands of Iranian authorities,&#8221; he said in a written statement.

Emilio Flores / Getty Images Running for President is a Hard Job: In California last month June 11, 2007 issue - Does Fred Thompson have what it takes to be president? The former senator turned "Law & Order" actor, who launched an exploratory committee last week, has been dogged by rumors that he doesn't have the work ethic for a long campaign. "The book on him is he's lazy," David Keene, president of the American Conservative Union, said last week. The criticism seems fed by Thompson's time in the Senate, where he maintained a less rigorous schedule than his colleagues and was known to duck out of late-night debates. Of the 90 bills he introduced during his eight years in the Senate, only four became law. Thompson has never denied being irritated with the pace of Senate life and cited it as one of the reasons he opted out of a 2002 re-election bid. "I don't like spending 14- and 16-hour days voting on 'sense of the Senate' resolutions on irrelevant matters," he said in 1998. "There are some important things we really need to get on withâand on a daily basis, it's very frustrating." His 2008 competitors have privately questioned his endurance, with one rival consultant (anonymous so as not to reflect badly on his own man) telling NEWSWEEK, "I doubt he has the fire in the belly to compete." Thompson allies are pushing back. "Anyone who says he's not a hard campaigner doesn't know what they are talking about," Tennessee GOP chair Bob Davis, a former Thompson aide, tells NEWSWEEK. "I was there, they weren't." Still, it's true that Thompson is preparing to mount a somewhat untraditional bid for the GOP nomination. Aides say he will spend less time on the road than his competitors and will instead rely on new forms of communication with voters, including blogs, online videos and other Internet tools. Thompson allies acknowledge that might not always fly in early-primary states where candidates are often judged as much by their ability to flip a pancake as on policy issues. Last week Thompson reached out to GOP officials in several primary states, including South Carolina, where he offered to emcee a fund-raiser for the state party. He is planning visits to Iowa and New Hampshire later this month. One of Thompson's key talking points will be that he's a Washington outsider, but he and his advisers are all Beltway vets. He's been consulting with former senators Howard Baker, Bill Frist and incumbent Sen. Lamar Alexander. He's tapped Tom Collamore, a former aide to Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, as his campaign manager and former Federal Election Commission chairman Michael Toner as the campaign's general counsel, with more hires expected in coming weeks. That's high productivity from a guy with a rep for laziness as far back as high school. In his yearbook at Lawrenceburg County High, Thompson put this quote next to his senior portrait: "The lazier a man is, the more he plans to do tomorrow." &copy; 2007 Newsweek, Inc. | MORE FROM NEWSWEEK PERISCOPE Conventional Wisdom: TB Sheets Edition Thompson and the 'Laziness' Issue Conventional Wisdom: TB Sheets Edition Military: Gates and the Press Supreme Court: Alito's Year Health: Can a Man Make a Baby?

Monday, Jun. 04, 2007 Former Bush White House aide Lewis "Scooter" Libby exits the U.S. Federal Courthouse after he was convicted of four federal crimes at the U.S. Federal Courthouse in Washington, March 6, 2007. Jim Bourg / Reuters When United States District Judge Reggie Walton sentences I. Lewis Scooter Libby Tuesday for perjury and obstruction of justice, watch how he handles one of the most troubling aspects of federal sentencing law: allowing a harsher sentence for a crime that was never proven. How Libby's Trial Hurt the Press On the eve of Scooter Libby's sentencing, the damage from a troubling prosecution has already been done &#151; to journalists and the public interest Will Bush Pardon Libby? The President has never been forthcoming with pardons, but he may at least leave the door open for Scooter Libby Why Libby's Defense Failed Lawyers for the former White House aide, convicted for his role in the Valerie Plame affair, couldn't deliver on their promises Libby: Fall of a Vulcan How a very smart and very loyal aide to Dick Cheney got indicted for allegedly lying about his role in defending the war In case you forgot, a jury convicted Libby, Vice President Dick Cheneys former chief of staff, in March of lying to federal investigators about leaking the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame. The leak was the thing for most Americans, the crux of an apparent White House campaign to discredit Plames husband, Joseph Wilson, who wrote a 2003 op-ed piece debunking WMD justifications for the Iraq war. But while outing a CIA agent can be illegal, neither Libby nor anyone else was actually charged with doing that to Plame. In fact, pre-trial maneuvering found the prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, insisting that this was not a case about a leak and fighting defense requests for documents about whether Plame was ever a covert agent, a status that could have made intentionally leaking her identity a crime. Thanks to Fitzgeralds brief advocating a stiff sentence for Libby, we found out last week that the CIA did indeed consider Plames identity classified, at least for 18 months. The prosecutor has brought this up now in apparent support of a remarkable claim: Libby should serve 30 to 37 months in prisonabout twice what the federal probation office recommends and way more than the probation favored by the defensebecause the underlying (and uncharged) crime was so serious. How can a crime that may never have happened &#151; and that at one point the prosecutor argued was largely irrelevant to the case &#151; now increase a criminal sentence? Its part of the magic of the federal sentencing guidelines, which were mandatory until two years ago. The controversial rules prescribe penalties that can be raised or lowered within a range, depending on various factors. One factor in a perjury case is the severity of the crime originally being investigated. Its part of a general category of enhancements &#151; from particularly depraved conduct to the use of a weapon &#151; that can, depending on the crime, increase a sentence if the judge determines by a preponderance of the evidence (the laws lowest level of proof) that they happened. To get a sense of the absurdity of this, think of someone found guilty beyond a reasonable doubtthe highest level of proofof dealing 20 grams of cocaine, and the judge saying, hey, theres evidence that you dealt 10 times that amount, so you get an extra eight years. The U.S. Supreme Court is well aware that enhancing sentences this way can be unfair, and the justices have struggled with it since 2000. Thats when the court ruled 5-4 in Apprendi v. New Jersey that a New Jersey mans 10-year sentence (the maximum under state law) for shooting at a black neighbors house could not be increased by two years just because the judge believed the crime was racially motivated. Unless the facts leading to the sentence are determined by a jury (or admitted to in a guilty plea), the court said, a judge required to impose a sentence longer than the prescribed statutory maximum violates the defendants Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The Supreme Court returned to the issue four years later in Blakely v. Washington. This time, the justices decided, also by a 5-4 vote, that Washington states sentencing rules violated a kidnappers Sixth Amendment right. Since the judge determined that the kidnapper had acted with deliberate cruelty, the rules allowed the judge to add 37 months to the 53-month sentence. Even though 53 months was far below the statutory maximum of 10 years, the sentence was still unconstitutional, a conclusion that suggested the federal guidelines, which operated in a similar way, were in jeopardy. In January 2005, the high court finally gave an answer: enhancements required by the federal guidelines also violate the right to a jury trial, but the constitutional fix is to make the guidelines optional. So a judge can use his traditional discretion to determine sentences, while consulting the guidelines, and so long as the sentences are reasonable, they wont violate the Sixth Amendment. This is the law that Judge Walton will operate under Tuesday. He must review the guidelines, and if he believes that Libbys lies hid a probable violation of the law against outing covert agents, he can bump up the sentence to 30 months or more. The betting here is that he wont. It would give too much weight to a mere suspicion. Still, the case is too high-profile for probation, so look for a sentence in the neighborhood of the 15 months suggested by the probation departments report. And dont expect Libby to be free on bond pending appeal. Federal judges usually dont allow that unless the bases for appeal are strong, and they dont seem to be in this case. Libby, it seems, will do time sooner rather than later &#151; even if he doesnt do as much as Patrick Fitzgerald would like, or sentencing guidelines would allow.

An Islamic militant Website has said it will soon release video clips showing the capture of three American soldiers who went missing in Iraq in mid-May. The body of one soldier was later found in Iraq's Euphrates River, but the other two remain missing. A family friend of one of the missing soldiers said the U.S. military has briefed the soldier's father about the video, which does not show if the men are alive. The Washington-based SITE Institute, which monitors militant Websites, said it had obtained the 10-minute, 41-second video that shows the planning stages and kidnapping operation as well as footage from after the attack that was shown on the pan-Arab satellite channel Al-Jazeera. The institute said the video also shows the identification cards of the missing soldiers. SITE released a still shot of the identification cards video that also displays the headline: "Bush is the reason of the loss of your POWs" written on the screen above the cards. SITE did not say how it obtained the video. A prominent Islamic Website, which commonly posts videos from militant groups, said in a banner headline that it would show the video within hours, but it was not yet posted. The three U.S. soldiers were captured south of Baghdad on May 12 in an ambush later claimed by an insurgent umbrella group, the Islamic State of Iraq, that includes al-Qaida in Iraq. The body of one of the soldiers was found on May 23 in the Euphrates River and later identified by the U.S. military as Pfc. Joseph Anzack Jr., 20, of Torrance, California. The two other soldiers - Spc. Alex R. Jimenez, 25, of Lawrence, Massachusetts, and Pvt. Byron W. Fouty, 19, of Waterford, Michigan - remain missing. On Sunday, the U.S. military said the search was continuing, with a joint U.S.-Iraqi force conducting what it called Operation Polar Charade near Rushdi Mullah, south of Baghdad. Nineteen suspected militants were detained during the effort, the military said, although it did not give more details about possible links to the missing soldiers. Officials have said many wanted men not connected to the ambush have been rounded up as a side benefit of the search. It said the suspects were taken to a detention facility for further questioning. A family friend of Fouty said the military briefed his father, Mick Fouty, about the video on Saturday night. "From what I hear, it shows the soldier's uniforms and dog tags and warns the U.S. to back off on the search," said Cathy Conger of suburban Detroit. "What it does not show one way or another is if they're alive or not," Conger said. "I just feel really bad about it. I hope that he's still alive. My prayers are with him." Fouty's stepfather, Gordon Dibler of Oxford, Michigan, told a suburban Detroit radio station that the military told him that the video showed personal identification items from the soldiers. "They prepared me in a very proper and considerate way," he told WWJ-AM radio. In Massachusetts, the Jimenez family had not seen the video, said family friend Wendy Luzon, who spoke with Jimenez's father, Ramon "Andy" Jimenez. "He said it was a good sign for the family," Luzon said. The three are from the 10th Mountain Division based out of Fort Drum, New York. No comments have so far been submitted.

The man, Abdel Nur, is believed to be at large on the island. Three other suspects are in custody, accused of conspiring to blow up fuel tanks and pipelines serving the airport, one of the world's busiest. The suspects include a former cargo worker and an ex-MP for the South American nation of Guyana. Had the plot been carried out, it could have resulted in unfathomable damage, deaths and destruction US attorney Roslynn Mauskopf JFK 'bomb plot' charges The plot - which is said not to have gone past the planning stages - involved blowing up the airport's fuel tanks and pipeline, US justice department officials said. One of the arrests was made in New York and the other two took place in Trinidad. Guyanese citizen Abdul Kadir, a former member of Guyana's parliament, and Kareem Ibrahim, from Trinidad, are in custody in Trinidad and Tobago. The authorities said both men were associates of Jamaat al Muslimeen, a Muslim organisation behind a coup attempt in Trinidad in 1990. The former JFK cargo worker was arrested in Brooklyn late on Friday and named as Russell Defreitas, originally from Guyana. Mr Defreitas was arraigned in New York City on Saturday afternoon, but did not enter a plea.

It was "one of the most chilling plots imaginable," US attorney Roslynn Mauskopf told a news conference. "Had the plot been carried out, it could have resulted in unfathomable damage, deaths and destruction." The pipeline is 40 miles (64km) long and carries jet fuel from New Jersey and through the New York boroughs of Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens. See a map of the area The pipeline serves two other airports in the area - LaGuardia and Newark Liberty. The FBI said the alleged plot never got beyond the planning stages and there was no threat to air safety or to the public, but that the group's intentions were never in doubt. "One clear signature of this cell was its persistence, they consistently worked to refine their plot," said Mark Mershon of the FBI's New York office. "They took extensive measures to seek expert advice, finances and explosives." The alleged plot was brought to light when Mr Defreitas recruited an FBI informant to help him in the plan, officials said. Mr Kadir is one of the three men already arrested The men conducted surveillance of the airport, including videotaping their targets and downloading satellite images from the internet, officials said. They said the informant had recorded some of the conversations he had with Mr Defreitas. "Any time you hit Kennedy, it is the most hurtful thing to the United States," Mr Defreitas said, according to a recording played to reporters. "To hit John F Kennedy, wow... they love John F Kennedy like he's the man... if you hit that, this whole country will be in mourning. You can kill the man twice." In another recorded conversation the suspect was alleged to have said: "Even the twin towers can't touch it," referring to the attack on the World Trade Centre in New York City on 11 September 2001 that killed some 3,000 people. Any time you hit Kennedy, it is the most hurtful thing to the United States Alleged statement by Russell Defreitas "This can destroy the economy of America for some time," Mr Defreitas was alleged to have said. Mr Kadir studied at the University of Guyana and at the Trinidad campus of the University of West Indies, the Associated Press (AP) reported. Mr Kadir's wife said her husband knew Mr Nur in the 1980s, but the pair were no longer in contact, AP reported. "We have not seen him for a long time and I would be surprised if my husband has any links with him still," the agency quoted her as saying. The arrests are the latest in a series of alleged plots targeting American facilities and landmarks. Six men were arrested last month on charges of plotting to attack Fort Dix army base in the state of New Jersey. Three people were arrested in July last year outside the US in connection with a plan to suicide bomb the tunnel under the Hudson River connecting Manhattan with New Jersey. And in June 2006, seven suspects were charged over an alleged plot to destroy the country's tallest building - the Sears Tower in Chicago.

Overall, the format of the debate was excellent. Abandoning the rigid structure with candidates speaking in a predetermined order with the yellow and red timer lights really helped the candidates come alive. Wolf Blitzer, who did an excellent job of moderating the debate, used his freedom with such a flexible format, creating some good follow-up discussion and debate among the candidates. This became especially effective in drawing out the differences between the candidates. Speaking of which, since Cornell decided to choose our convocation speaker from CNN, why couldn't we choose Wolf Blitzer? But enough on the format of the debate. Let's discuss the actual debate itself and my take on the top four performers in the debate. Even though I approach this from a liberal perspective, I probably have a different take since I'm naturally conservative, but hopefully you will appreciate this analysis from a former debater in high school. Obama really differentiated himself on Iraq from other candidates by how he magnified the impact of Iraq, discussing on how it affects the real war on terror in Afghanistan and on the ability of the United States to deal with other nations such as Iran and Pakistan. No other candidate laid out the negative externalities of the Iraq war like he did. I definitely noticed how Edwards teamed up with Obama against Hillary in the early part of the debate, as both traded compliments on Iraq and healthcare. When Edwards really tried to go after Obama on healthcare, he lost. I saw the most actual debate and clash in this moment of the debate, so that played a huge role in why I choose Obama. Obama's healthcare views focused on driving down healthcare costs. Edwards required mandatory insurance and accused Obama's plan of creating gaps since it is not mandatory. Obama then proved how high healthcare costs can prevent people from buying insurance even if it is mandatory, creating gaps. Both plans create gaps, not just Obama's, but Obama's plan drives down costs. Obama's decision to mandate health are for children also blocked out another attack from Edwards about the advantage of mandatory healthcare, allowing Obama to sail smoothly to victory. In general, Obama displayed a strong knowledge of the issues and talked specifics. When he started talking about how families feel financial strains from all sides with kids and college, retirement savings, gas prices, etc., Obama displayed some of his fine speaking skills and knowledge, whether on the topic of the country of Iraq or the small family and their needs. Edwards had many of the same strengths Obama did, especially on Iraq and healthcare. Although his attempt to overtake Obama on the issue of healthcare ultimately failed, he still benefited from their alliance and mutual compliments in the debate, propelling both to the top of the field. On the issue of Iran, he delivered a very intelligent answer showing his excellent understanding of the political situation there. Also, I liked how he focused on reestablishing America's moral authority and standing in the world as his number one issue in the first 100 days. Furthermore, whenever Edwards answered his questions, he often made it a point to distinguish himself from other candidates, showing how he's better. Biden obviously took an unconventional approach by supporting the war funding bill, but I really liked his approach and how he defended it. Discussing his reasons to continue to fund the war, Biden focused on why he was right and refused to focus on why others were wrong or even call them wrong. That put him on a higher ground than the other candidates in terms of character. Also, he cited specifically how voting against funding would have a real impact on protecting troops' lives from I.E.D. attacks. Everyone supports the troops as Obama mentioned, and Biden played off of that well, putting himself above politics on the vote. His focus on practicality and reality also worked effectively, and Hillary even complemented his pragmatism when discussing Don't Ask, Don't Tell . Kucinich, who is too idealistic, provided another good opportunity to show the advantage of pragmatism. As much as the other candidates promised to do this or that on Iraq, Biden laid out the disturbing truth: under Bush, Democrats either had to put together 67 votes to override his veto or win in 2008 to safely reverse course in Iraq. Any other way could endanger the troops. On the issue of immigration, he started by building off the excellent answer of Richardson and then further expanded on relating the legislation to its positive impact on the war on drugs. Responses like that demonstrated his broad knowledge of the issues and his experience in the Senate. Darfur also proved to be a strong point for Biden. He laid out a real strong case on why we need to act and not talk on Darfur, setting the tone for all future discussion on Darfur in the debate. Clinton had some good humor, some nice anti-Bush jabs, and some powerful sound bites, but she lacked substance beyond that. Obama opposed the war from the start but said little on Congress's war funding bill until he voted "No" in the end. Edwards voted for the original war but vocally opposed the new war funding bill. Hillary voted for the original war and stayed silent on the war funding bill until she voted in the end. While Obama and Edwards debated specific details of the other one's healthcare plan, Hillary had to discuss her unsuccessful attempt for universal healthcare back in the '90s. Also, she refused to discuss how to deal with Iran if diplomacy does not work, dismissing it as a hypothetical situation, not even going into the topic of sanctions as others did. Hillary spent too much time dismissing âhypotheticalâ scenarios and questioning the questions. It can be done effectively once as Obama did on the question of English as the official language (he argued that it divided America and distracted from the real issues on immigration), but Hillary overdid it. While Obama gave specific reasons on why to target Osama bin Laden if civilian casualties would occur, Hillary asked for specifics on the question. She came off as indecisive and pretentious. at Jun 4 2007 - 7:33am | Flat list - collapsed Flat list - expanded Threaded list - collapsed Threaded list - expanded Date - newest first Date - oldest first 10 comments per page 30 comments per page 50 comments per page 70 comments per page 90 comments per page 150 comments per page 200 comments per page 250 comments per page 300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes. The Democrats are worthless. The Republicans are twice as worthless. By Anonymous (not verified) at June 4, 2007 - 8:02am | Republicans vs Democrats. Big difference here for I do not think either of them are worthless for they hold there offices by being appointed by the people. Hiliary in the debate did a overall great job. For the article says she did to much on not answering questions because of them being to hypothetical. I do not think she was. I mean look at the basis of the questions definetly one on Bin Laden "if you had intelligence on him that he is there would you attack?" well we had intelligence that there where wmd in Iraq. But overall in the Debate I would think Obama did the est in answering the questions as if he was going to be the president and Clinton answered them as she was in office and called President. By Anonymous (not verified) at June 4, 2007 - 12:19pm | The big loser in this "debate" was Wolf Blitzer and CNN. The placement on stage of the debaters, and the number of questions and time allowed for each debater, highlights a glaring problem with the U.S. election process. If the debates are intended to inform voters, then every candidate ought to be given equal respect, prominence, and an equal number of questions and response time. That didn't happen. It was clear who CNN and Blitzer favored, and who they didn't. The manipulation of the audience' time and attention was shameful, in my opinion. The questions were inane. Is this the best that CNN could do? As far as the candidates go, I thought every candidate had good points to make, and we obviously need to hear more from all but CNN's top three. I don't think a "winner" can be declared without offering an equal debating ground, and that wasn't there. By Kevin Rydell (not verified) at June 4, 2007 - 8:53am | Thankyou for your analysis of the Democratic debate last night. It was refreshing to hear someone who wasn't in lock-step with the political pundits last in giving the debate to Hillary Clinton. I myself thought John Edwards was very clear in presenting his positions on the different topics. I especially liked the answer he gave on the issue of the high price of oil. He said we should go after the oil companies and form a committee to investigate their practices. This was an immediate solution unlike the the other candidates who talked about our dependence on foreign oil which is a long term solution. Another point I'd like to make which no one has addressed is the strategic placement of Hillary Clinton in the debate. She's always in the center which puts the spotlight on her. Granted she's the only woman candidate, but is that a valid reason to place her in the center? Isn't that discrimination? One of the pundits last night said that Senator Clinton was so strong that all of the other candidates eyes were on her. Of course, she was in the center and she spoke forcefully. I give the debate to Edwards. Thankyou for allowing me to respond.

(not verified) at June 4, 2007 - 10:25am | One could only be thankful for the analysis here concluding that Obama won if that is what they want to hear. But the so-called pundits are right. I mean, when even Hillary-hating, Obama-loving Arianna Huffington calls it Sen. Clinton's night, its time to let a little reality sink in. Sen. Clinton is now the consesus winner of both debates. Why? The MSM? The Party power bosses? Some other unfair conspiracy? No. Its really quite simple: competence. She is the most informed, the most articulate, and far-and-away the most experienced of the candidates. After six-plus years of Bush incompetence, these traits are setting her apart from the field. As they should. By Joe Brooks (not verified) at June 4, 2007 - 11:02am | Are you an indiot? Read the Are you an indiot?

This Week In OFFbeat Crime 6.1.2007 Catholic Parish Cans Organist For Selling Sex Toys Add This Blog To: Illinois School Denies Diplomas For Enthusiastic Cheering Was Galesburg High Justified in Withholding Five Students' Diplomas Because of Parental Over-Exuberance? Honor Student's Achievement Superseded by Audience's Lack of Decorum (AP) When it comes to offbeat news topics few sources have been so rich as the American education system. The latest in what is already an embarrassingly long list of stories I've covered comes out Galesburg, a former factory town in northwestern Illinois, where five high-schoolers had their diplomas withheld because the audience cheered when their names were called during graduation. How could this be legal, you ask? Last month, Galesburg High School asked students and parents "to sign a contract promising to act in [a] dignified way. Violators were warned they could be denied their diplomas and barred from an ." As a result, five students, including honors student Caisha Gayles, had what should have been a moment of celebration transformed into "one of the worst days of [their] li[ves]." For its part the school claims that it was just trying to maintain order after past graduations proved unruly. According to school Assistant Superintendent Joel Estes, "we have to do something... to restore some dignity and honor to the ceremony so that everyone can appreciate it and enjoy it." And so, even though all five have officially graduated, they cannot get the diplomas they earned until completing eight hours of public service, "answering phones, sorting books or doing other work for the district." not even the ACLU denies Galesburg High School's right to have order during graduation, the methods they have chosen to maintain it raise a number of questions about rationality and fairness. For instance, why would the school punish students for the actions of their family and friends? It certainly wouldn't reward students if those same people helped complete their educational requirements for them. Wouldn't it make more sense to remove those causing the commotion rather than punish those who earned a right to be there? Another question is how the school administrators were able to tell within a 2,000-seat auditorium whose family and friends were doing the cheering? As Nadia Trent, one of the five denied her diploma pointed out, "[i]t's not fair. Somebody could not like me and just decide to yell to get me in trouble." Moreover, some witnesses have confirmed that other students received their diplomas even though cheering occurred when their names were called. If this is true, what standards were used to quantify unacceptable jubilation? Was it decibel level or cheering pitch or, as some have alleged, and the school has denied, did race play a role? Beyond the "how" and "why," though, is the question of commonsense -- or lack thereof -- that makes a school enact such a policy as this in the first place. On a day when families are celebrating a milestone in their children's lives, it is only natural for them to yell for joy. This "dignity and honor" that the school is striving for must be balanced against the pride and elation parents instinctively feel at the ceremonial culmination of what, in most cases, is their child's greatest lifetime accomplishment. Attempting to silence that emotion by withholding diplomas seems almost as heartless and illogical as denying a couple their wedding license because their family cried too loudly during the ceremony. By Emil Steiner | June 4, 2007; 11:34 AM ET | Category: to report offensive comments. These students were singled out because they were black plain and simple. The school is racist and everyone who was there knows it but they don't have the courage to speak up. Posted by: Billy | June 4, 2007 11:31 AM This does violate all the moral principles of American society. With public schools like this, is it any wonder we re-elect war criminals to violate the human rights of millions? After all, the students learned that it is OK to punish one person for something bad another one did. It really isn't possible to have a government run school system teach anything we want our children to know about the need to limit government power and ensure it is used appropriately. Posted by: Andy | June 4, 2007 12:31 PM A perfect example of what is wrong with our educational system. This is like holding a sales clerk responsible for being robbed at gun point. The community should be outraged. Those responsible should be humiliated, just as they have humiliated these innocent students, this is shameful. Posted by: Ewe x Forritt | June 4, 2007 12:31 PM As usual simple rules cannot be followed and the school is the bad guy. These students did not deserve this. But at what point do we actually hold people responsible for their actions. I've been to plenty of graduations, and the families behavior gets worse and worse each year. This school put out a warning way ahead of time, and of course the rules were not followed. Lets send this message to our kids, rules are rules, you dont have to follow them, and if you dont you wont get in trouble either. People should just do whats right, the families of these kids are to blame. Posted by: Kevin | June 4, 2007 12:44 PM Hmmm...seems extreme liberalism and political correctness are now reaping what they have sowed. What a disgrace...what message does this send to those grads...that celebrating is wrong...good God (yep, I said God) will somebody turn off the politically correct gas that's choking this nation! Posted by: Jamie | June 4, 2007 12:52 PM The rules were sent home in advance saying no disruptive behavior. The parents and the students signed the rules in advance saying they would not be disruptive. They were disruptive and the school did exactly, to the letter, of wat they said they would do. It is not a racially motivated issue except for the fact that the disruptive people are not white. Good on the school for saying and then DOING exactly what they said they would do. Posted by: Come On People | June 4, 2007 12:54 PM Here is a thought! Instead of voicing our concerns on this site lets just voice our concerns to Mr. Joel Estes himself. Mr. Joel Estes, Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum & Instruction Sorry, I couldnt find his personal email but I am sure the school would forward our concerns to his office. Love our education system, Posted by: John Stevens | June 4, 2007 12:55 PM They probably don't know how to read those diplomas anyway! Posted by: ed | June 4, 2007 12:56 PM I attended and graduated from Galesburg High School in 2003. It's ridiculous how parents and family members acted at graduation. There was no respect to other fellow graduates and their families. After graduation, my family commented after the event about how disrespectful people are. They could barely hear my name being said. If you sign a contract, that's that. Abide by it. Actions were taken appropriately. You broke the rules, deal with the consequences. Posted by: JC | June 4, 2007 12:57 PM I agree parents should act respectful, but as the author points out,why not hold them responsible. Have police remove them from the gym, by force if necessary, but don't punish students who did nothing wrong for it. This school deserves an F for its judgment Posted by: Kelly | June 4, 2007 01:04 PM The USA public school bureaucracy is one of the last refuges for individuals who fail to master or even exercise basic skills w/r to human social interaction. In other words, they threaten and then punish the innocent, thinking that a gross demonstration of power will allow them to control the unruly. This is wrong on too many levels to discuss here. The school management may also be racist, but their primary failing is incompetence. It is the height of irony for this type of destructive behavior to be employed against a body of new graduates by their supposed teachers and role models. Posted by: The Garrett | June 4, 2007 01:12 PM Rules are rules. School said behave in a dignified way and these people behaved like animals. How are youngsters supposed to be accountable for their actions when not even their parents can keep their word? One things for sure I betcha next year graduation will be orderly. Posted by: Edward, NJ | June 4, 2007 01:22 PM The one thing I have the biggest grievance with is all the people assuming that all five kids were black because of the picture. In the article it says nothing about their ethnicity. Posted by: mec | June 4, 2007 01:26 PM I was there for my daughters graduation and most everyone was sickened by what happened. The cheering was minor, around 3 seconds worth and they refused to give them diplomas for that? I could barely hear it. To answer the race question, 4 were black and one was hispanic. Some parents have met and we are considering taking on the school district over this. Galesburg High is the only school around so we have to send our children there. If we had other options we would boycott but they have a monopoly on education around here. Posted by: A Parent | June 4, 2007 01:33 PM Well I guess if it was only minor and only 3 seconds the school should just look the other way. While were at it why not just throw at the rules altogether. Seems to me if they wouldnt have broken the rule about cheering there would be nothing to report. Why not contact those other families and blame them instead of the school. Oh wait that would mean hold them accountable. We wouldnt want to do that would we. Lets sue the school!! Do people really live in this reality? Posted by: Kevin | June 4, 2007 01:52 PM I applaud the administration, faculty, and Board of Education at Galesburg High School for their attempts at silencing the raucus hooligans at Commencements, who, with their pre-planned, orchestrated displays and outburst, strip all dignity from a special ocassion and achievement. Are these people so starved for attention, that they are willing to 'steal' 10-15 seconds of focus on a young person, who is their friend or family member, on his/her special moment culminating 12 years of formal schooling? Galesburg set reasonable standards, announced expectations and consequences and received statements of compliance. Then, it held accountable those who ignored the standards--sounds like what we expect from schools. By the way, this isn't about 'race,' it's about 'class.' Posted by: Dennis Hunt | June 4, 2007 01:57 PM This is the problem with "reporting" done from far away, and while not in attendance; the lack of conveying the whole story. The issue was not cheering, as this has always occurred. The issue was the horrible profanity and vulgarity that laced the "only natural cheering for joy"; this in a family environment with many small children. I agree that is a difficult proposition to punish the graduates for the actions of the audience, but having attended several graduations there, SOMETHING had to be done. I applaud the effort, if not the method. Mr. Steiner thinks it wrong that 5 students had their diplomas withheld for the actions of others. While this is arguably true, what is completely neglected is the effect the raucous vulgarity had on EVERYONE in attendance. Next time, he should obtain all the facts and include them in the story so an accurate picture can be portrayed. Posted by: ksd | June 4, 2007 02:11 PM Umm, "Kevin", "ksd", "Dennis Hunt" and "Come on People" seem to be missing the point. The kids weren't violating any rules. Period. None of the children punished violated the rules. They made no noise. Spectators made the noise. This is not hard to understand. Kids - no noise. Spectators - noise. Got it? Good. So no, the kids should not be punished for the actions of third parties. The actions of third parties are the responsibility of said third parties. Anyone claiming otherwise is advocating guilt by association, not justice and individual accountability - something conservatives claim to champion. Punish those who made the noise (parents and other spectators), not those who were on the stage obeying the rules (students). But then, I'm a rational libertarian who believes in individual responsibility - not an authority worshipping control freak who believes in punishing a son for the sins of his father. Posted by: James Landrith | June 4, 2007 02:32 PM Wow. Punishing somebody for the actions of another person. This is called fair? Then again, I knew a few people that needed some punishment when I was in High School. It would have been easy to get ten-twenty people to scream loudly when their names were called. As far as the first poster: racist, NO. Stupid, YES. Posted by: SoMD | June 4, 2007 02:34 PM Just stupid. Our childred are being taught by retards. Posted by: Jackal | June 4, 2007 03:10 PM I don't think this was a racist move as suggested below, but I've been to several high school graduations including my own 7 years ago, and it seems to be a trend that the African American families cheer loudly for their graduating kids while the white families just kept quiet. It was very annoying honestly, and the audience was told to hold the applause till the end, but without fail a good number of the African American students family's always yell for them. It is stupid to withold their diplomas, and I think a different method to discipline should be enacted, such as escorting those making loud and obnoxious noises out of the building. The cheer often times lasted long enough so that you couldn't hear the next graduates name being called over the loudspeaker. Posted by: MC | June 4, 2007 03:25 PM 2 simple truths: White folks can't jump and black folks can't stay quite in an auditorium/movie theater. Don't ask why, its just the way of the world. Posted by: | June 4, 2007 04:04 PM It sounds like there wasn't a clear understanding of what "disruption" means. I fail to see what good it does to blatantly disobey rules, especially noting how important this is to one's child. So, take away the idea that the family members broke the rules out of spite. It probably was just a miscommunication on the part of the staff and parents. Next year will be better. Posted by: Becca | June 4, 2007 04:17 PM They still graduated..they just didn't get the piece of paper. I'm also fairly sure that if the families of the individuals took responsibility for what they did and came to the district offering to complete the community service required to receive the slip of paper, the school district would take it. There were no other options to reduce the behavior issues and if you can think of one...I suggest you call the school district...but you can't think of a better way can you? Posted by: A teacher | June 4, 2007 04:49 PM So, "a teacher" (6/4/2007, 4:49 pm) believes in punishing innocent students to get back at parents? Wow. I am speechless. I sincerely hope this person does not teach in Fairfax County. Posted by: James Landrith | June 4, 2007 05:01 PM A teacher you should be fired. People like you are what makes America the laughing stock it is today. Give these girls their diplomas and let this idiocy be over.

NBC's Jim Miklaszewski reports. NBC, MSNBC and news services CAIRO, Egypt - An al-Qaida umbrella group claimed in a new video Monday that its militants killed three U.S. soldiers after capturing them last month. In Baghdad, the U.S. military condemned the claim and said the search for them will continue. An Islamic militant Web site said earlier on Monday it would soon release video clips showing the capture of three American soldiers who disappeared following an ambush in Iraq in mid-May. The body of one soldier was later found, but the other two remain missing. The video shows the kidnapping as well as footage from after the attack, according to the Washington-based SITE Institute, which said it had obtained the 10-minute, 41-second clip. The institute, which monitors militant Web sites, said the video also shows the identification cards of the two of the soldiers. A prominent Islamic Web site said in a banner headline it would soon show the video, but it was not yet posted. Terrorism expert Evan Kohlman told NBC News he has seen the video and that it does not show any of the three soldiers who were abducted. According to Kohlman, the footage is of a nighttime attack from a distance, which the video claims is when the Americans were grabbed. One GI found dead The three U.S. soldiers were captured west of Baghdad on May 12 in an ambush later claimed by an insurgent umbrella group, the Islamic State of Iraq, that includes al-Qaida in Iraq. The body of one of the soldiers was found on May 23 in the Euphrates River and later identified by the U.S. military as Pfc. Joseph Anzack Jr., 20, of Torrance, Calif. The two other soldiers â Spc. Alex R. Jimenez, 25, of Lawrence, Mass., and Pvt. Byron W. Fouty, 19, of Waterford, Mich. â remain missing. A family friend of Fouty said the military briefed the soldierâs father, Mick Fouty, about the video on Saturday night. âFrom what I hear, it shows the soldiers' uniforms and dog tags and warns the U.S. to back off on the search,â said Cathy Conger. Fouty lived with her family in the Detroit suburb of Commerce Township for 14 months before he left for Iraq. âWhat it does not show one way or another is if theyâre alive or not,â Conger said. âI just feel really bad about it. I hope that heâs still alive. My prayers are with him.â Foutyâs stepfather, Gordon Dibler, said the military told him Saturday that the video showed personal identification items from the soldiers. âThey prepared me in a very proper and considerate way,â he told WWJ-AM radio in suburban Detroit. In Massachusetts, the Jimenez family had not seen the video Monday, said Wendy Luzon, a family friend who spoke with Jimenezâs father, Ramon âAndyâ Jimenez. âHe said it was a good sign for the family,â Luzon said. The three are from the 10th Mountain Division based out of Fort Drum, N.Y. Meantime, the U.S. military said Sunday that 14 American soldiers were killed in three deadly days in Iraq, including four in a single roadside bombing and one who was struck by a suicide bomber while on a foot patrol southwest of the capital. The blast that killed the four soldiers occurred Sunday as the troops were conducting a cordon and search operation northwest of the Iraqi capital, according to a statement. Two other soldiers from Multi-National Division-Baghdad were killed and five were wounded along with an Iraqi interpreter in two separate roadside bombings on Sunday, the military said. One soldier was killed Friday after the patrol approached two suspicious men for questioning near a mosque, and one of the suspects blew himself up, according to a statement. The military did not provide more details. Seven others troops were killed in a series of attacks across Iraq on Saturday. The deaths raised to at least 3,493 members of the U.S. military who have died since the war started in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count.

Jefferson indicted in bribery probe Rep. Jefferson indicted in bribery probe By LARA JAKES JORDAN, Associated Press Writer 4 minutes ago WASHINGTON - Rep. Willi, , ), D-La., was indicted Monday on federal charges of racketeering, money-laundering and soliciting more than $400,000 in bribes in a long-running investigation into business deals he tried to broker in Africa. He is the first sitting congressman to face charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits corporate bribery overseas. "But the essence of the charges are really very simple: Mr. Jefferson corruptly traded on his good office and on the Congress," said Chuck Rosenberg, the U.S. attorney for eastern Virginia. The 63-year-old Jefferson, whose Louisiana district includes New Orleans, has said little about the case publicly but has maintained his innocence. He was re-elected last year despite the investigation. Joseph Persichini, who leads FBI &#145;s Washington field office, called on the public to "take the time, read this charging document line by line, scheme by scheme, count by count. This case is about greed, power and arrogance." Two of Jefferson&#145;s associates have already struck plea bargains with prosecutors and have been sentenced. Another Jefferson associate, Louisville, Ky., telecommunications executive Vernon Jackson, pleaded guilty to paying between $400,000 and $1 million in bribes to Jefferson in exchange for his assistance securing business deals in Nigeria and other African nations. Jackson was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. The impact of the case has stretched across continents and even roiled presidential politics in Nigeria. According to court records, Jefferson told associates he needed cash to pay bribes to the country&#145;s vice president, Atiku Abubakar. The indictment does not name Abubakar. But it describes Jefferson&#145;s dealings with an unnamed "Nigerian Official A" who was a high-ranking official in Nigeria&#145;s executive branch who had a spouse in Potomac, Md. One of Abubakar&#145;s wives lived in that Washington suburb. In May 2006, the FBI raided Jefferson&#145;s congressional office, the first such raid on a congressman&#145;s Capitol office. That move sparked a constitutional debate over whether the executive branch stepped over a boundary. The raid&#145;s legality is still being argued on appeal. House leaders objected to the search, saying it was an unconstitutional intrusion on the lawmaking process. The FBI said the raid was necessary because Jefferson and his legal team had failed to respond to requests for documents. Some but not all the documents seized in the raid have been turned over Justice Department prosecutors. Associated Press writers Cain Burdeau in New Orleans and Matthew Barakat in McLean, Va., contributed to this report. -- -- -- -- A publication by the News One Publishing Group.

LOUIS &mdash; A federal appeals court opened the way for Missouri to resume executing inmates, ruling Monday that the state's lethal injection procedure is not cruel and unusual punishment. The case filed on behalf of condemned killer Michael Taylor had effectively halted Missouri executions since early last year. A judge said he wanted to be sure that the three-drug injection method did not cause risk of pain and suffering. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found "no evidence to indicate that any of the last six inmates executed suffered any unnecessary pain," according to its ruling. The court's decision reversed a ruling by U.S. District Judge Fernando Gaitan Jr. ordering reforms to Missouri's lethal injection procedures. He wanted the state to involve a doctor specializing in anesthesia, but the state has been unable to find a doctor willing to participate. Missouri is among nine states that have put executions on hold as it grapples with whether lethal injection is inhumane. Attorney General Jay Nixon said the decision "reopens the necessary legal avenue for the state of Missouri to move forward on this issue." Gov. Matt Blunt said he is directing the Department of Corrections to prepare execution procedures in compliance with the ruling. "One of the most important jobs I have as governor is to help keep Missourians safe," Blunt said. "Capital punishment is a vital deterrent to the most serious of crimes." Margaret Phillips of the Eastern Missouri Coalition Against the Death Penalty said many questions remain unanswered and it would be unwise for the state to renew executions. "The uncertainty of all of this is a good indication that Missouri needs a moratorium on the death penalty," she said.

According to a federal complaint, the four accused Muslim men and an informant who helped crack the plot to attack John F. Kennedy International Airport visited a compound belonging to Jamaat al Muslimeen, a radical Islamic group known for launching a bloody 1990 coup attempt in Trinidad. "These terrorists are in our own backyard," said Tom Corrigan, a former member of the FBI-New York Police Department Joint Terrorism Task Force. "They may have to reach out to people they don't necessarily trust, but they need - for guns, explosives, whatever." Although Jamaat al Muslimeen did have contact with the men accused in the Kennedy airport plot, it is not accused of offering them any support. The group, whose followers are largely black converts to Sunni Islam, has faded as a political force in Trinidad as its leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, fends off criminal charges of inciting violence. The Kennedy airport case and the recent plot to attack Fort Dix illustrate the need for inside information, Corrigan said. Six men were arrested in a plot to attack soldiers at the New Jersey military base after an FBI informant infiltrated that group. "These have been two significant cases back-to-back where informants were used," he said. In the Kennedy airport case, the informant was a twice-convicted drug dealer who found himself in the midst of a terrorist plot conceived as more devastating than the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. However, authorities say the plan was not well developed or far along. "Would you like to die as a martyr?" the informant was asked, according to the indictment. The man accused of being the mastermind, Russell Defreitas, 63, immigrated to the U.S. more than 30 years ago, but he told the federal informant that his feelings of disgust toward his adopted homeland had lingered for years. "Before terrorism started in this country," he said in one secretly recorded conversation. When Defreitas discussed his radical "brothers" with the informant, he made it clear they were not Arabs, but from Trinidad and Guyana. The complaint made clear the informant had deeply infiltrated the group. Defreitas, a retired JFK airport cargo worker, made four reconnaissance missions to the airport, authorities said. They captured each one on audio and video equipment. Kareem Ibrahim and another suspect, Abdul Kadir, were in custody in Trinidad awaiting extradition hearings. Officials identified Kadir as a former mayor of a Guyanese town and a member of the country's Parliament. Authorities in Trinidad were still seeking a fourth suspect, Abdel Nur.

They scour the international news media for stories on Hussein's deadly arsenal. They consult foreign intelligence agencies on the status of Iraqi weapons. And they maintain a cadre of about 300 weapons experts from 50 countries and prepare them for inspections in Iraq -- inspections they will almost certainly never conduct, in search of weapons that few believe exist Poisoning the Troops, Again The Pentagon has a disturbing pattern of withholding information on the impact of chemical/biological weapons and other toxins on US service members.

Blog About It! or just enabling jstl so that we can just write ${bean.property} and jsp takes care of the new lines. --> A reserve Marine, on his way to Kansas City, was in the center of a political storm on Friday. Sgt. Adam Kokesh was making his way from D.C. for a hearing Monday questioning his patriotism. Sgt. Kokesh could face charges of misconduct after attending an anti-war protest in uniform. Veterans and military agencies were divided over the whether Kokesh has the right as a reservist to exercise his freedom of speech while in uniform. On March 29 Sgt. Kokesh was told he was being investigated for taking part in an anti-war protest while in uniform. "They asked for a fight on this, were going to give it to them," Sgt. Kokesh said. Sgt. Kokesh served as a Marine in Iraq, and is now a part of the Independent Ready Reserve, or the IRR. "That after having served honorably," Sgt. Kokesh said. "If you're in that IRR on that list and you're only responsibility is to maintain a proper address and you're a civilian, until you are called back then you have at least the rights of every American citizen. No less. No more." The Veterans of Foreign Wars agree. In a response released recently, a VFW spokesperson supported Kokesh by saying, "trying to hush up and punish fellow Americans for exercising the same democratic right we're trying to instill in Iraq is not what we're all about." Some Metro veterans strongly disagree. "He has every right to an opinion but he should have not done it in uniform," Jay Hyde, retired US Airforce, said. Even a veteran who opposes the war in Iraq felt Kokesh stepped out of line. "I wouldn't have in uniform, nor would I have said anything that would have demoralized the services in any way," James Connor, retired US Navy, said. On Monday morning, a marine panel in Kansas City will decide if Kokesh should be dishonorably discharged. , FOX 4 News Email to a friend Executions May Resume in Missouri A federal appeals court on Monday opened the way for Missouri to resume executing condemned inmates, ruling the state's lethal injectio...

Featuring some strong words, Iraq topped the agenda, with other hot topics including Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions, ending the bloodshed in Darfur, immigration, and health care reform. Each candidate will be hoping to win back the White House held by the Republican George Bush since January 2001. Hilary Clinton, who was criticised by the party for supporting a congressional war resolution in 2002, was attacked for voting, along with Illinois Senator Barack Obama, against an Iraq war funding bill last month that did not include a troop pullout date. North Carolina Senator John Edwards, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2004, said the votes by Mrs Clinton and Mr Obama, while the right thing to do, were done too quietly and without firm leadership. Mrs Clinton tried to deflect the attack by blaming President Bush, saying: "This is George Bush&#39;s war," while Obama said he had opposed the war from the outset: "So you&#39;re about four and a half years late on leadership on this issue," Mr Obama responded to Mr Edwards. The front-runners in the battle to win the Democratic nomination were joined by the other contenders: J Biden, Chris Dodd, Mike Gravel, Dennis Kucinich and Bill Richardson. Analysts say that for the lesser-known candidates it is vital that they use the debate to impress voters to overcome their lack of funds and media attention to stay in the election campaign. On Tuesday, New Hampshire will host the ten Republicans seeking their party&#39;s nomination, with many of the issues expected to be the same.

"I think that everybody was kind of sitting back, taking it easy and thinking that, you know, peace and prosperity were going to kind of last forever. I think we know better than that now," the former Tennessee senator told The Associated Press. Actor and former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., speaks at a fundraiser in Richmond, Va., Saturday, June 2, 2007. Thompson took the first formal step toward a widely expected bid for the presidency, establishing a preliminary campaign committee on Friday. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) (Steve Helber - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article "We live in a more dangerous (time of) things that threaten our very existence, things that threaten our peace, things that threaten our economic stability." In an interview Saturday night before speaking to the Virginia GOP, Thompson would not talk in detail about why he believes he might make a good president or what his priorities would be. "I'd do lots of things," he said, declining to elaborate. During his 1994-2002 Senate tenure, he was considered a reliably conservative vote. But he had few significant legislative achievements and established a reputation as a less-than-hard worker. "That's one rap that you can cure," Thompson said. When pressed, he struggled to name his greatest accomplishment in the Senate. He said he managed the homeland security bill in the full Senate and added: "There were a lot of things. ... It doesn't always have to do with putting your name on a piece of legislation. There was an awful lot of bad legislation that I helped to stop for one thing." But, he said with a smile, "We'll have a chance to get into all that when I start telling everybody what a wonderful person I am. But we're not quite at that stage." At least not yet. After flirting with a candidacy for months, the former senator and actor known to millions as the tough prosecutor on NBC's "Law & Order" took the first formal step toward the race for the GOP nomination Friday in establishing a preliminary campaign committee. Thompson, however, said he still was not ready to commit to a 2008 campaign. "We've not made a final decision on it. But obviously we're thinking pretty seriously about it," he said. "Everybody who has an opportunity to make even a small difference in the course of the direction of the country has got to look at that very seriously."

Galesburg graduate denied diploma Posted: Sunday, June 03, 2007 at 8:38 PM A rule designed to make a local high school graduation a sacred event has one graduate very upset after she and four others were denied their diplomas when members of the crowd cheered for them as they crossed the stage. Now, one week after what was supposed to be a very happy day, Galesburg High School graduate Caisha Gayles says her graduation turned out to be a nightmare. For most high schoolers graduation day is a culmination of 4 years of hard work and dedication. "It was exciting walking across the stage,"said Gayles. But for honors student Gales what began as a happy occasion became anything but. "There was a little cheering, they said my name, there was some cheering for like 5 seconds but that was it I hadn't even gone over to shake Mr. Chiles' hand or get my diploma at all before it was done," said Gayles. But school officials say those 5 seconds of cheering were enough to withhold her diploma. "It was disrespectful I think to our community," said Assistant Superintendent Joel Estes. After a very rowdy graduation two years ago, Estes explains, the school district adopted a zero tolerance approach to the graduation ceremony- making graduates and their parents sign a behavior contract. "That said they would refrain from these kinds of outbursts and celebrations, that we were going to be in order and it was going to be honorable and dignified so that everyone could hear their name," said Estes. But for Caisha and her mother, that explanation is not enough. "I don't understand why it's a big issue, you know, it wasn't even disrupting the ceremony," said Carolyn Gayles. "I'm not angry at my family at all. I'm glad they cheered for me because its my day, they're proud of me and I'm glad they showed they were proud of me," said Caisha. Now all that's left of what Caisha says should have been the happiest day of her high school career are some withering balloons hanging on her porch- a sad reminder of what she's missing. "All I want is that little piece of paper I want to frame it and put it on my wall," said Caisha. Caisha and the other students can still get their transcripts showing that they graduated- they just don't have the commemorative diploma. School officials are meeting with the students and their families this week to decide if there's a way they can earn back their diplomas. As for Caisha, she's off to college in the fall, she wants to become a teacher. Submit a comment about this story It is stupid for that school to have done that. If my school was to have done that none of us would have got our diplomas. &mdash; ashley helferich, Flanagan How can the Galesburg School District punish the student for something someone in the audience did??? It is sooooo unfair. &mdash; Sheri Owen, Galesburg 12 years of hardwork destroyed by 5 seconds of cheer by OTHERS!!! &mdash; B C, Houston At least on paper... .... this is high-level absurdity! Signing a "conduct contract?" A proud parent spontaneously cheering for honors student daughter? How incredibly ridiculous! This is an example of over zealous educators who are becoming so prevalent in our government-run school system. This could never have happened 25 years ago, and it should not happen now. If there was a problem with excessively disruptive behavior two years ago, this type of atrocity is is NOT the answer. Ridiculous! &mdash; M Stacy, Battle Creek What in the world are we doing to our kids? I think parents of current students should with hold local tax dollars until these young ladies get their diplomas. Maybe if we without a few pay checks from the school board officials they would know how these youngsters feel. &mdash; Adam Clark, Indianapolis Graduation is something to celebrate Graduation day is a day to celebrate. I am very thankful that no one in my family had the misfortune to attend Galesburg schools. That girl earned her diploma and should receive it - with an apology from the school administration. &mdash; Helen Bloom, Edelstein I find it ironic that this student wants to become a teacher. Perhaps she will be able to come back to Galesburg and take the job of some of the staff that made such a ridiculous decision. The outcome of this decision is poor public relations for the school district and ill will toward the district by those effected. &mdash; Steve Marshall, Dunlap What a shame that a school district would deny diplomas for 5 seconds of what didn't seem to be disruptive behavior! We as parents are entitled to cheer for our children when they graduated afterall we have spent 18 years with them helping them to reach this point. You, the educators, at the most, have only spent 12 years with them and in this case only 4 years. As long as it does not get too rowdy why not let the families have a little voice in the ceremony. I don't think it detracts from the dignity of the ceremony at all. School districts are getting to big for their britches in matters like this. Now these kids can't even throw their caps at graduation or have their families cheer for them. What has this world come to when traditions are simply thrown out the window for what some consider dignity? Let us and the students have some fun with what is a long process to get to!! Stop trying to control every person for every little thing they do.

The full 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals let stand, without comment, an earlier ruling by a three-judge panel of the court that said an appeal by one of the inmates was filed too late. Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann said in a statement, "I am pleased with the 6th Circuit Court&#039;s decision today denying Cooey&#039;s request that the full court reconsider the panel&#039;s decision." The lawsuit was filed in 2004 by inmate Richard Cooey, who was sentenced to die for raping and killing two University of Akron students in 1986. The lawsuit, which was later joined by several other inmates, did not seek to reverse Cooey&#039;s conviction or sentence but argued the state&#039;s use of lethal injection is inhumane. The Ohio Public Defender&#039;s office, which represents Cooey, said it will now seek an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Huge setback to Bush&#x27;s military tribunals at Guant&#xE1;namo Efficient adoption system attracts American couples to Ethiopia JFK plot was short on means and smarts "We believe these issues are strong enough to merit the U.S. Supreme Court&#039;s time and attention," said Greg Meyers, the chief counsel to the Ohio Public Defender. If the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a challenge to the statute of limitations in filing appeals, it would open the door to an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the inmates&#039; claim that Ohio&#039;s method of lethal injection is cruel and unusual punishment that amounts to torture. Ohio uses a three-drug cocktail: sodium pentothal, which is a barbiturate; pancuronium bromide, a paralyzing agent; and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. Opponents say the painkiller can wear off after the paralyzing agent is administered but before the heart-stopping agent is administered, leaving a person in pain but unable to let anybody know. Meyers said he was not sure how many inmates would be affected if the 6th Circuit&#039;s latest decision stands. Six judges on the 6th Circuit, many of whom oppose any implementation of the death penalty, took an unusual step Friday and criticized the majority&#039;s decision not to review the case, which they said will result in simultaneous and contradictory proceedings in state and federal court. Also Friday, a federal judge in Columbus, Ohio, delayed the upcoming execution of an inmate who was allowed to join the injection lawsuit earlier this year.

Hillary Clinton (D.-N.Y) during the Sunday debate at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire. When John Edwards, former senator of North Carolina, criticized Sen. Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama (D.-Ill.) for âstanding quietâ on their recent votes to cut funding for U.S. troops in Iraq, Clinton implied that the Bush Administration should be held responsible for the outcome in Iraq, not Democrats. âThere is a difference between leading and following that I have made clear from the outset,â Edwards said. âOthers were not, others were quietâ¦.Sen. Clinton and Sen. Obama did not say anything until they appeared on the floor of the Senate and they were among the last to vote.â Clinton responded, âI think itâs important particularly to point out, this is George Bushâs war â he is responsible for this war.â She said, âHe started the war. He mismanaged the war. He escalated the war. And he refuses to end the war.â Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D.-Ohio) seized her comment and said it was âa teachable moment,â that demonstrated the Democratsâ unwillingness to take responsibility for the outcome in Iraq. Kucinich said, âThe Democrats were put in charge by the people in the last election with the thought that they were going to end the war. Well, they haven't. They have to stop the funding.â Clinton has gone back and forth over funding the war since announcing she would run for President. She even changed her position in the last month on it. After a May 5 interview, the Associated Pressâ Mike Glover reported that âClinton said she âof courseâ eventually will support a measure paying for the troops.â Then, before breaking for Memorial Day recess, Clinton voted to against a bill to fund operations in Iraq through July. Clinton was one of fourteen senators to vote against the measure. Sen. Joe Biden (D.-M.D.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, defended his vote to maintain funding for the war. In doing so, he explained the consequences of not sending the money. Biden said, "As long as there is a single troop in Iraq that I know if I take action by funding them, I increase the prospect they will live or not be injured, I cannot and will not vote no to fund them." âSome things are worth losing elections over,â he said. ?One of the sharpest attacks of the evening was delivered by Obama after moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Clinton to defend not reading the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate. Clinton recently admitted in a town hall meeting that she did not read the prewar intelligence report before she voted to use force in Iraq. The NIE contained information compiled by Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, who was installed by President Clinton, which President Bush used to make the case for war. It was available to all U.S. senators before the vote on the Iraq War Resolution. Clinton?--a lawyer by training?--said, ?"I knew all the arguments. I knew what they all were saying.?" Obama, who has been opposed to the war since its inception, suggested if Clinton had read the report she may not have voted for the war. âI will say on the National Intelligence Estimate that Chairman Graham, Bob Graham (D.) of Florida, who at the time was the head of the Intelligence Committee, cited that specifically as one of the reasons that he voted against it. So obviously there was some pertinent information there,â Obama said. Edwardsâ comments on this issue suggested Clinton was untrustworthy, Biden implied she was irresponsible and Obama indicated she was downright neglectful. As the campaign for President goes on, so will the war and Clintonâs day job in the Senate. Many Democrats, not just those standing on stage last night, donât trust Clinton because she refuses to adopt clear âforâ or âagainstâ positions on critical matters, like the war in Iraq. There will be plenty of âyesâ or ânoâ votes she will have to make in the near future that will dictate the outcome in Iraq. And, judging from the course she is on now, those will not be positions even her fellow Democrats will let her defend on stage. Amanda Carpenter is National Political Reporter for Townhall.com..

Full Article & Comments Vote on this Article Articles with Most Votes View in ascending order View in descending order Monday, June, 04, 2007 12:13 PM A Lady Hawk amongst Chickens It appears that Senator Clinton (who I cannot and will not vote for) is the only "Hawk" in the company of a bunch of politically-correct, poll-driven, far left, mealy-mouthed, chicken-hearted dumba*ses; who I wouldn't vote for if they were running for garbage collector. I am not sure who I am voting for but it is sure not this group of losers. Monday, June, 04, 2007 1:11 PM "Clinton implied that the Bush Administration should be held responsible for the outcome in Iraq, not Democrats." But Ms. Clinton: I thought we were "all in this together"....? âIf we could to do it without a tremendous amount of collateral damage, I think, maybe with one or two exceptions, we could give the order to do it.â Her husband tried to "take out bin laden" (her words). At least she didn't say (so far) that she voted for it before she voted against it. Monday, June, 04, 2007 1:15 PM Didn't a famous Democrat once say... I voted for the war before I voted against it (or something to that effect)? What ever happened to that guy? Monday, June, 04, 2007 1:45 PM Still beats slackjawed republican debate The Democrats are at least willing to have a REAL DEBATE on the REAL ISSUES, unlike the Republicans. That is why the Democrats remain currently comfortably ahead in all the polls. "On one hand, they were reluctant to wholeheartedly back Bushâs strategy, which polls show is unpopular with the public at large; on the other, they could not afford to abandon the president and antagonize conservative Republicans who vote in the partyâs presidential primary." Monday, June, 04, 2007 1:47 PM said it best for me, defund the war all together. Did I say Howdy? I meant Dennis Kucinich. Sorry for the diss, Howdy. Monday, June, 04, 2007 2:05 PM Typical Democrat...."The democrats are at least willing to have a REAL DEBATE on the real issues" Are you serious? You mean argueing with each other about who will take the blame for what they already feel is a lost war? Thats what you call debate....what a shame! I would rather listen to a canidate who has a plan for winning and a withdrawel plan that doesnt concide defeat to Islamo Nazis. Democrats will blame everything they fail at on G. Bush for the next hundred years. Monday, June, 04, 2007 2:14 PM First, if you believe that in the general election the debacle in Iraq is going to be laid at the feet of anyone other than President Bush and his lock-step Republican lackey's, you've definitely been smoking something funny. Second, John Edwards has zero credibility on this issue. When he was in the Senate--including when he was running for vice president--he was one of the most hawkish supporters of the war. Indeed, as has been widely reported, it was Sen. Edwards who must ardently argued against John Kerry taking the position that his vote for the war had been wrong in light of what he knew in September 2004. But now that Sen. Edwards is out of the Senate and doesn't have to worry about things like actually voting on pieces of legislation that are brought forward, he's all full of advice on what everyone else should do. I also find it quite amusing that Sen. Edwards tried to make the point last night that experience as a legislator is not relevant to being President given that his only arguably-relevant experience is the six years he spent in the Senate. Does he ever think before he opens his mouth? As for Sen. Edwards' apology for his vote to authorize military action against Iraq, if its truly sincere, his time would be much better spent going door-to-door to personally deliver his apology to each of the families that has lost a loved one in Iraq due to what Sen. Edwards now confesses to have been a grievous error on his part. Call me crazy, but I would prefer a Commander-in-Chief who exercised her best judgment based on the information that was known at the time--including, if Sen. Clinton is to be believed (and President Bush has not denied this), the personal assurances the President privately gave to certain legislators (and then completely ignored) that he would fully exhaust diplomatic alternatives before launching military action against Iraq--rather than some namby-pamby wimp who now admits that he made a mistake on the only significant issue he was ever required to take a formal position on in public life. I'm sure Republicans would rather run against a weakling like Edwards, but don't hold your breath. Assuming that the first two Democratic Presidential debates are any indication, Sen. Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. And notwithstanding all the trash talking that will be flying in the air, she is clearly the most well-informed, articulate, and experienced of all the candidates who are running--traits that voters are likely to find very appealing after eight years of the amiable and likable but ill-informed and grossly incompetent President Bush. My advice to conservatives who claim to be hoping that Sen. Clinton is the nominee: be careful what you ask for. Monday, June, 04, 2007 2:22 PM independant thinker -Typical Repub There was AT LEAST REAL DEBATE with the Democrats. The Republican jokers dodge all reality. Wasting time with loony questions like "intelligent design". You must be jokers to waste time with such stupidity with the mess the Republicans have created on this planet. That is why the Democrats remain currently comfortably ahead in all the polls. Monday, June, 04, 2007 2:50 PM Why do you shoot yourself in the feet when its so easy to refute your propaganda?? You'll see by the most recent and past polls comparing the leaders of Dem and Gop races (Clinton vs. Guliani)...its Guliani that retains the COMFORTABLE LEAD. Those darn facts...they mess up a good fantasy. Monday, June, 04, 2007 2:56 PM Eagleone - you ARE FOOLING.......... You cite ONE POLL of only two players? I GUESS YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND MY POST. And IF you wish to play the POLLING GAME.... Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:05 PM Eagleone - you ARE FOOLING(2)..... Column down right side : ELECTION 2008 THIRD LINK: Clinton, Giuliani Maintain Lead "Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani remains the leader in the GOP race, but the poll suggests that the surge in support he received after declaring his candidacy has stalled and that his backing of abortion rights and gay rights has caused more Republicans to turn away from him." Thanks for the SOURCE TO HELP PROVE YOU WRONG! Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:09 PM Really, Please Stop Laughable Real Clear politics is a summation of MANY polls. And also from your very site you linked to Guliani retains the lead in most polls when compared with Clinton. Sorry nice try though Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:12 PM Hey Guliani is More Liberal than Con. I admit. I wont vote for him in the primaries, but by these polls, he will definitely be one of the top two or three that win the nomination. In the general election, a choice between Clinton, Obama or any other socialist wanabee, its a no contest. Middle of the road voters and even conservative America will elect Guliani. Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:17 PM Eagleone - Smoking CRACK FROM THE FRONT PAGE!!! See, you still want to play POLLING GAME... YOU SILLY LITTLE REPUB! Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:24 PM no scroll button on your puter laughable?? You really want to quote CBS and ABC as your hole cards?? Out of 16 separate polls, Guliani wins 12 of them. You like to embarrass yourself like this? Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:25 PM Eagleone - No REALLY Playing POLLING GAME IS SILLY! One of the reasons for my statement is........ Check out Rasmussen today. NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS IN U.S. HITS NEW LOW. The Democrats remain currently comfortably ahead in all the polls. Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:26 PM Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:31 PM IF Congressional elections held TODAY. American voters who would currently vote in their district, would vote DEMOCRATIC. Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:35 PM Isn't it funny that more people consider themselves "OTHER" over being Republican? Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:41 PM LOL, Laughable Filabuster Time? So you go back to hanging your hat on one poll again after trying to sell me that looking at all of them is more important, and then changing the actual topic?! LOL!! Have a good day laughable. Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:47 PM Eagleone - ITS THE SUM TOTAL, DUH! I have sourced MORE THAN ONE. "Those who can't debate LIE!" You do make me LAUGH! Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:49 PM Eagleone - SPINS ON Less Repub's = LESS VOTES My original post, stands as TRUE. "That is why the Democrats remain currently comfortably ahead in all the polls." Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:53 PM Eagleone - Another "1" for you Rebirth of the âpolitical centerâ EQUALS REPUBLICAN LOSS! Poll shows rebirth of the âpolitical centerâ The Democrats remain currently comfortably ahead in all the polls. Monday, June, 04, 2007 3:59 PM Rudy to the Rescue? Giuliani has about played out his "9/11" run, don't you really think? Monday, June, 04, 2007 4:23 PM Why Hillary in 08? Why would anyone vote for Hillary other than lobbyists? Huffington-Here are a few things that I hope readers will take away from reading our book, Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton: For all her criticism of George Bush and Dick Cheney for secrecy and incompetence, she has exhibited both traits on occasion. Our book shows how she, like the president and vice president, exaggerated the pre-war intelligence on Iraq prior to her October 2002 vote authorizing the war. She also didnât do her homework before the vote. In 2006, Hillary consulted a secretive energy task force of her own, just as Cheney did five years earlier. Like the president, she has spoken naively about one of the ways to reduce Americaâs dependence on foreign oil supplies (she said better sources of electricity could reduce dependence). She pretends to have been somewhat against the war before she was for it, by mischaracterizing her own record. Nor has Hillaryâs training as a lawyer or her reputation for being Washingtonâs smartest, most diligent senator, prevented her from making mistakes or defying Senate rules â whether it is writing her own bookâs narrative, promoting her environmental credentials or hiding parts of her Senate staff from proper disclosure. She and her allies are working hard in their attempt to obfuscate the bookâs revelations. Their motive is clear: Her Way shines a spotlight on certain areas of Hillaryâs political and professional career that she hopes voters will ignore. Monday, June, 04, 2007 4:34 PM News Corp. Boss hosts Hillary I guess News Corp. is trying to hedge it's bet to a winner? With Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa joining her, Clinton raised $850,000 at an event at the home of News Corp. pres. Peter Chernin, and another $250,000 at the home of Brett Ratner, according to sources. Sign Up to Post Your Comments Sign Up to Post Your Comments If you are already registered, click to login.

In an extensive article, the daily responded to statements against the Cuban Revolution by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, during her recent visit to Spain. Granma stated that, since Cuba was a priority issue on Rice' s agenda with her counterpart Miguel Moratinos, we would have to ask if she tackled damages and suffering of the Cuban people due to the US blockade. Both officials analyzed the situation in the concentration camp located on the US naval base, illegally occupying part of the Cuban territory of Guantanamo. The article questions if the two foreign ministers discussed the CIA secret flights to Spain, kidnappings and tortures horrifying the European public opinion and the release in United States of terrorist Luis Posada Carriles.

Flight 3050 was diverted to Oakland International Sunday after pilots reported trouble with the plane's landing gear, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. Southwest spokeswoman Beth Harbin said the 119 passengers and crew members were evacuated via the aircraft's inflatable slides and no injuries were reported. Ian Gregor, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation Administration in Los Angeles, said the pilot told air traffic controllers at the airport that the lights for the landing gear mechanisms under the wings and on the nose of the plane indicated they were working properly. The controllers gave the pilot visual confirmation that the landing gear was down before a landing was attempted. However, the landing gear under the nose collapsed upon touchdown. Southwest Airlines and the FAA are investigating the incident. The plane originally was heading from Sacramento to San Diego. &copy; Copyright 2007 United Press International, Inc.

A copy of the indictment can be read here As you may recall, Mr. Jefferson won re-election while under federal scrutiny. And his case had caused a showdown between the branches of power after F.B.I. agents &#8212; for the first time in the nation&#8217;s history &#8212; raided the Capitol Hill offices of a congressman. A separate raid at his home uncovered $90,000 in cash stashed inside containers in his freezer, according to federal authorities. Republicans, who were buffeted in the last few years by the Abramoff scandals and other corruption investigations, have long pointed to the federal investigation into Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s activities as evidence that Democrats were not without their own corruption taint. News of Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s indictment today had not even been formally released before Republicans were issuing yet another edition of the &#8220;Dirty Laundry&#8221; list, quoting Speaker Nancy Pelosi promising to run an ethical House and other leaders vowing to clean house, er, so to speak. The indictment alleges that Mr. Jefferson and others solicited bribes from 2001-2005 and other payments to him and his family in exchange for business dealings with companies in Louisiana in exchange for dealings with businesses in Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon. Some of the payments he sought for him and his family, the indictment alleges, included not only cash, but percentage shares of revenues or profits, and stock ownership in companies wanting his official help. The list goes on and on. Mr. Jefferson has repeatedly said that he has done nothing wrong. But some people in the case had already pleaded guilty, leading to anticipation that he would ultimately be charged. For example, Vernon Jackson, a business associate from iGate, a technology company, pleaded guilty to paying between $400,000 and $1 million to Mr. Jefferson in exchange for the lawmakerâs help obtaining business deals in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa. Mr. Jackson was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. Mr. Jefferson had been stripped of his committee assignment on Ways and Means last year, and he was never placed on the Homeland Security panel. Our colleague Jeff Zeleny tells us that House Minority Leader John Boehner&#8217;s office plans to quickly move the matter to the Ethics Committee, to try to force a vote within 30 days as to whether Mr. Jefferson should be expelled from the House. While that&#8217;s unlikely to happen while Mr. Jefferson is awaiting trial, the case already has given the G.O.P. ammunition against the Democratic leadership. Mrs. Pelosi just released a statement signaling the breadth of the indictment against Mr. Jefferson: âThe charges in the indictment against Congressman Jefferson are extremely serious. While Mr. Jefferson, just as any other citizen, must be considered innocent until proven guilty, if these charges are proven true, they constitute an egregious and unacceptable abuse of public trust and power. âAs we have demonstrated in implementing tough ethics reforms and passing tough lobbying reforms already this year, Democrats are committed to upholding a high ethical standard and eliminating corruption and unethical behavior from the Congress.â David Johnston contributed to this post.

Homicides committed in small towns and mid-size cities took a dramatic downswing &mdash; resulting in an overall 0.3 percent increase in the murder rate across the country, the new preliminary data show. Year-end totals for murders rose in eight of the nation's 10 largest cities: Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio and San Diego. That contributed to a 6.7 percent murder rate increase in cities with populations over 1 million people. The murder rate dropped in two other big cities, Dallas and Los Angeles. And it plummeted by an overall 11.9 percent in smaller cities, towns and rural areas, the data show. The growing homicide numbers contributed to an overall 1.3 percent hike in violent crime nationwide in 2006. A year earlier, violent crime rose by 2.3 percent, the first increase since 2001. FBI Assistant Director Ken Kaiser, detailing the new numbers to reporters in Washington, said it's too soon to expect a long-term increase in violent crime. "Am I happy with the increase in violent crime? Absolutely not. I'd have to be a fool to say I was," Kaiser said. "But I would tell you I think (police) are working very hard out there." Kaiser also noted "dips and rises" in the nation's violent crime rate over the last several decades, and he described some successes in prosecuting and convicting criminals by teams of federal agents working with local and state police. The new numbers come in the wake of the Bush administration's shifting focus &mdash; evidenced by lessening Justice Department grants and FBI investigators &mdash; from fighting crime to combating terrorists after the 2001 attacks. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has pledged to devote millions of additional dollars and a surge of federal agents to aid crime-riddled cities. Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson, a Democrat who presides over the National League of Cities, said local officials nationwide are asking Congress for more than $1 billion annually to restore stretched-thin police departments back to their full force. He attributed the rise, in part, to increased gang activity, violent youths and domestic crimes. Indianapolis' murder rate rose by 30 percent &mdash; from 108 homicides in 2005 to 140 in 2006, the data show. "We've faced some of the same problems," Peterson said. "It's been a huge concern to us." Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., who chairs a Senate panel overseeing crime issues, said the new numbers should serve as "a wake-up call" to the administration, which he accused of slashing funding that would have put more local cops on the street. "For years we drove down the crime rates &mdash; but now we're in reverse gear," said Biden, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president. "This administration has repeatedly ignored the needs to law enforcement, giving short shrift to the men and women who keep us safe every day." Justice spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said crime remains historically low in America and noted Gonzales' efforts to crack down on violence. "We are concerned about crime in our communities and are taking action to protect our citizens from violent crime," Roehrkasse said. The FBI report, compiled with data from more than 11,700 law enforcement agencies nationwide, also showed: _Robberies spiked by 6 percent, marking the highest increase in any category of crime surveyed. _Property crimes decreased overall by 2.9 percent from 2005. Burglaries, however, rose slightly &mdash; particularly in mid-size cities, where the rate grew by 3.3 percent. _Violent crime rose in every region of the country except for the Northeast, the FBI reported. Western states saw the largest jump in violent crime, by 2.8 percent.

MORE FROM TODAY'S JOURNAL Court Vacates FCC Indecency Order Stocks Rise a Bit Despite China Drop Grand Jury Indicts Jefferson Palm to Sell 25% Stake, Overhaul Board Court Reverses Credit-Score Ruling How H-P Reclaimed its PC Lead Over Dell Murdoch May Make Concessions Palm to Sell 25% Stake, Overhaul Board The Gift of a Fat Wallet After a Late Start, As a late entry into the crowded, expensive, presidential campaign, Fred Thompson's first big test of viability will be his ability to raise money quickly. A major part of the former Tennessee senator's strategy is a heavy reliance on the Internet to get his message out and to raise funds. He is also trying to tap into the large number of well-heeled Republican financiers who have yet to commit to a 2008 hopeful, amid widespread disaffection among party loyalists with the current field. Yet a late start and signs that Mr. Thompson may adopt an unconventional campaign style -- limiting in-person appearances by making extensive use of blogging and online video -- could crimp the television actor's ability to raise money over the long haul. He has suggested he isn't enamored of leaving his family for long stretches of campaign travel. The question is whether an Internet campaign will help him raise money quickly or leave big donors cold. Signs suggest that he won't have trouble in the early going. In a conference call Tuesday with more than 100 supporters, Mr. Thompson flogged each to raise a quick $46,000 by early this week to become "First Day Founders," participants said. Each can presumably meet his or her goal by tapping 20 friends to make a maximum $2,300 individual donation. If they do, Mr. Thompson will start his campaign with a quick display of fund-raising prowess and about $5 million on hand. "I see the indecision and noncommitted people on the Republican side who are yearning for a conservative," said Mack Mattingly, a former Georgia senator who was on the conference call and committed to raising the cash. "I don't see raising money as a big problem. Even bad candidates are raising money." Mr. Mattingly said the quick money infusion into Mr. Thompson's campaign is calculated to be "part of the splash" the "Law and Order" star makes this week in a race where polls have already placed even his prospective candidacy toward the top of the pack. Mr. Thompson's ability to raise money for a presidential campaign formally began Friday, with official creation of an exploratory committee in Nashville. Mr. Thompson will have a boost from Tennessee Republican Rep. Zach Wamp, who says his four-month-old draft-Thompson Web site has collected the email addresses of 30,000 people who have signaled they are willing to help a Thompson campaign. Mr. Wamp was also on the fund-raising call. Mr. Thompson also comes late to other factors of the campaign, such as building organizations in crucial states and establishing name recognition among voters. But the 2008 presidential race is marked in the early going by the tidal wave of money that has already flowed to the top candidates in both campaigns. The Republican money leader so far is former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, whose first-quarter fund-raising total stood at $20 million. Rudy Giuliani and John McCain raised $16 million and $13 million, respectively. Delaying his candidacy cost Mr. Thompson support of two prominent Tennessee fund-raisers: Chip Saltsman, former state party chairman, who raised more than $100,000 for President Bush's 2004 race; and Ted Welch, a Nashville developer who raised more than $200,000 for Mr. Bush's last campaign, becoming a Bush "Ranger." Mr. Saltsman has committed to longshot Arkansas ex-Gov. Mike Huckabee. Mr. Welch said he would have been happy to raise funds for Mr. Thompson but has already committed to Mr. Romney. Brad Freeman, a Los Angeles investment banker and Bush Ranger who is raising money for Mitt Romney, said most of his friends have already committed. He points to Mr. Welch as a symbol of the difficulties that may face Mr. Thompson: "Even his natural constituency is spoken for," Mr. Freeman said. "I think he'll find it tough sledding -- a lot of ships have sailed." WHO'S IN FOR 2008 who's in and who's out for the 2008 U.S. presidential race, and how much money they've raised. And in a hint of what could become a problem with an Internet-heavy strategy, Mr. Wamp said Mr. Thompson fielded a number of questions about his platform in the conference call last week on positions that the candidate has already sketched out. "The money people aren't bloggers and activists, so they didn't know Fred has spoken extensively about many of these issues, such as immigration," Mr. Wamp said. "So I broke in and told them it's all collected on our Web site, and they should go and take a look." Few Republican operatives doubt Mr. Thompson can raise the initial $5 million he seeks. As one major party fund-raiser noted, "You don't put out a figure like that unless you're pretty sure you can get there." Moreover, the fund-raiser said, four large states that turned out well for President Bush in 2004 have been tapped only lightly by the current crop of candidates. The states he cited are Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan. "I expect Fred will concentrate on those," said the fund-raiser, who has committed to another candidate. First-quarter finance reports suggest numerous former Bush mega-fund-raisers remain uncommitted and could be tapped. In Florida, for example, Gov. Charlie Crist has a massive fund-raising apparatus and has notably avoided formally endorsing anyone. And former Gov. Jeb Bush has yet to back anyone. "I will remain neutral and try to help our party's nominee," he said in an email.

John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has come under fire for his support of the Senate immigration bill, on Monday fired a salvo back at his competitors for the Republican nomination, accusing them of &ldquo;pandering for votes&rdquo; on immigration reform. &ldquo;I would hope that any candidate for president would not suggest doing nothing. And I would hope they wouldn&rsquo;t play politics for their own interests if the cost of their ambition was to make this problem even harder to solve,&rdquo; McCain said in a speech at the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. &ldquo;To want the office so badly that you would intentionally make our country&rsquo;s problems worse might prove you can read a poll or take a cheap shot, but it hardly demonstrates presidential leadership. &ldquo;Pandering for votes on this issue, while offering no solution to the problem, amounts to doing nothing,&rdquo; the senator added. &ldquo;And doing nothing is silent amnesty.&rdquo; McCain also criticized Washington&rsquo;s political culture, saying, &ldquo;Problems are left unsolved year after year, because we fear the political consequences of seriously addressing them or value their utility as political attacks in our campaigns.&rdquo; The immigration problem has become so serious, McCain claimed, that not acting now &ldquo;would be an unconscionable abrogation of our responsibilities.&rdquo; The lawmaker challenged the bill&rsquo;s detractors to put forward proposals to cope with the immigration problem. McCain went on to discuss the bill&rsquo;s specifics. He stressed that it would increase the number of Border Patrol agents to 20,000; add 370 miles of border fencing; and install ground sensors, unmanned aerial systems and advanced communications systems with the most up-to-date technology available. He also praised the employer-verification system and the tamperproof biometric identification cards the bill mandates, saying &ldquo;our economy needs&rdquo; a temporary-worker program. To conclude, McCain tackled the criticism that the legislation amounts to &ldquo;amnesty.&rdquo; He said the path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the bill is &ldquo;harder, longer and more expensive&rdquo; than that of immigrants who come the U.S. legally. Obtaining citizenship under the legislation could take as long as 13 years, McCain said, and will cost immigrants &ldquo;thousands of dollars&rdquo; as well as require them to learn English. &ldquo;That is a fair, practical and humane way of dealing with the problem of 12 million undocumented workers,&rdquo; the presidential hopeful said. &ldquo;And if someone objects to it, especially if they are a candidate for president, they should have the responsibility and courage to propose another way.&rdquo; Also On The Hill Sen.

Speaking in politically crucial Florida, with its heavy concentration of Cuban and Haitian immigrants, McCain argued that while the bill is imperfect, it is an attempt to secure U.S. borders, help the economy and identify those who have entered the nation illegally. Sen. John McCain responds to media questions following a speech in support of the an immigration bill being debated in Congress to the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce in Coral Gables, Fla., Monday, June 4, 2007. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) (Lynne Sladky - AP) Life Along 'La Linea' The U.S.-Mexico border is at the forefront of a growing debate over U.S. immigration and border security reform. Save & Share Article The four-term Arizona senator chided rivals who are trying to score points on the issue. McCain never mentioned any names but his target was obvious _ Romney. "To want the office so badly that you would intentionally make our country's problems worse might prove you can read a poll or take a cheap shot, but it hardly demonstrates presidential leadership," McCain told members of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. "The immigration approach proposed by Senators McCain and Kennedy falls short of a workable solution to an important problem," the former Massachusetts governor said in a statement. Romney said he respected McCain, but his opposition was based on a "principled disagreement about policies and priorities related to enforcement of our immigration laws." The immigration measure would tighten security on the Mexican border while allowing some of the 12 million illegal immigrants a chance to stay in the United States and eventually become citizens. President Bush has spoken out in favor of the bipartisan bill. Romney did not mention the president, instead describing the immigration approach of McCain and liberal icon Kennedy. McCain said Bush understands the political implications. "The president knows. He spent eight years as governor of Texas," McCain told The Associated Press after his speech. "The Republican Party must address this issue, if, in my part of the country, we expect to attract Hispanic voters." McCain stands alone among the major candidates in supporting the bill. He has criticized Romney for opposing the measure based on provisions that would provide a path to legalization. "I will never conduct my campaign in such a way that it makes our country's most difficult challenges harder to solve. I hope you will hold all candidates to that same standard. Pandering for votes on this issue, while offering no solution to the problem, amounts to doing nothing. And doing nothing is silent amnesty," McCain said to loud applause.

By all appearances, Russell Defreitas was "a pretty sad character" at age 63, in the words of one law enforcement official. And yet the U.S. citizen from Guyana managed to make significant headway toward launching a terrorist attack on John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, officials said. Defreitas, a retired JFK cargo worker, allegedly made surveillance tapes of airport facilities. He made trips to Guyana and Trinidad, some of them paid for by an accomplice, authorities said. And, they said, he managed in a relatively short time to find Muslim extremists in Guyana and Trinidad apparently eager to help. U.S. law enforcement officials said Defreitas was nowhere near being capable of mounting an attack. He didn't have explosives, money or an executable plan. But one of the most alarming aspects of the case is that a man of such meager means made as much progress as he did, authorities said. "It is a bit worrisome when someone like this, who is a bit washed up, is able to go out and solicit funding and the blessing of others who are more organized and experienced," said a Justice Department official familiar with the case, speaking on condition of anonymity. "It is a bit frightening." Defreitas was one of four men charged in the case, which was announced by federal law enforcement officials Saturday. Defreitas was arrested at a Brooklyn diner Friday night; two alleged accomplices are in custody in Trinidad and are expected to be extradited to the United States; and another is said to be at large in Trinidad. Authorities said others might be charged. The criminal complaint unsealed Saturday connects at least six unnamed individuals &#8212; most of them in Guyana, which neighbors Venezuela, or Trinidad, off the coast of Venezuela &#8212; to the alleged plot. Defreitas is accused of being the architect and catalyst, a disgruntled Muslim who, officials said, sought support for a plan to blow up buildings, fuel tanks and pipelines at JFK. In some ways, the case may come down to whether jurors believe Defreitas was a menace. His court-appointed attorney, Andrew Carter, said in a telephone interview Sunday, "Even from the government perspective, &#91;Defreitas&#93; didn't have any means of carrying out this stuff they were allegedly trying to do." Carter reiterated comments he made during Defreitas' arraignment Saturday, saying, "There is more to the story," and suggesting that one of Defreitas' main lines of defense could be that the government's case was based largely on a paid FBI informant with drug-trafficking convictions who may be angling for a more lenient sentence. "There is a government source involved in a lot of this," Carter said. Asked whether Defreitas was a terrorist who posed a danger to the public, Carter said, "I don't believe so," and vowed to "vigorously defend him." Defreitas was portrayed in news accounts Sunday as a lonely figure, a man who made money selling books on street corners and shipping broken air-conditioning parts to Guyana. He is divorced and estranged from his two children, according to the reports. "People around here never see that man," said a Trinidadian woman who runs a 99-cent store next to his apartment building on Rockaway Avenue in Brooklyn. "I'm right here 15 years&#133;. The people in the building never see the man, so where did he come from?" Her shop caters to people in the neighborhood who stop by for toothpaste, toy water guns and hair gel. The woman, who did not want to be named, said the local Caribbean community was close-knit so it was strange that no one she knew remembered Defreitas, not even residents in his building. The neighborhood is largely populated by African Americans, Latinos and immigrants from the West Indies. On Rockaway Avenue, employees at four grocery stores, a check-cashing business and Jay's West Indian Restaurant, which serves oxtail and curried goat dishes, said they had no idea who he was. One screamed at a reporter: "This is harassment. I tell everyone, I did not know that man!" Defreitas' building is a faded four-story row house with a broken intercom that buzzes incessantly. Neighbors said the building was known to house drug addicts. Knocks on his door and others in the building went unanswered Sunday. A bail hearing for Defreitas is scheduled for Wednesday, his lawyer said. Law enforcement officials said the government of Trinidad and Tobago was cooperating with U.S. authorities, who are seeking extradition of the two men in custody there. One of the suspects, Abdul Kadir, a former member of Guyana's parliament, is portrayed in the complaint as a key figure, helping to pay for Defreitas' trips and making efforts to enlist financial and logistical support for the alleged plot from Jamaat al Muslimeen, an Islamic militant group in Trinidad. Kadir's wife, Isha, said in a CNN interview Sunday from Linden, Guyana, that she was shocked by the allegations. "You know, my husband &#8212; we are Muslims for 33 years," she said, according to a CNN transcript. "And no way, at no time we were ever involved in anything of plots of bombing or any plots against America. We are not a part of that. We have family &#8212; both of us &#8212; in America."

Forecasters discontinued the tropical storm warnings and watches issued for stretches of the Gulf Coast. The depression's sustained winds had slowed to near 35 mph, and it was moving north-northeast at about 23 mph. The storm, which formed on the first day of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall in the Tampa Bay area in the morning and had moved across the state to Jacksonville by evening, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Dry conditions in Florida have left Lake Okeechobee, the second-largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States, at its lowest recorded level. The rain was expected to help cool down some of the smoldering areas of a massive wildfire along the Florida-Georgia border, allowing fire crews to focus where the fire is actively raging, said Larry Morris with the firefighters' joint information center. By Saturday morning, Barry had brought nearly 6 inches of rain to Melbourne and nearly 7 inches to West Palm Beach. It was expected to drop 3 to6 inches of rain on parts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Isolated areas could get 10 inches of rain. "It'll help a little bit, but ... we're still going to be under drought conditions," said Kim Brabander, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. She said 30 to 40 inches of rain was needed. In Mexico, Tropical Storm Barbara made landfall Saturday and weakened to a depression as it moved inland from the southern Pacific coast near the Guatemala border, an area notoriously vulnerable to flooding. At least 1,400 people were evacuated from coastal communities in Mexico's southern Chiapas state, Radio Formula reported. In the Guatemalan border town of Ocos, at least 100 people were evacuated after the storm tore roofs of their homes. Affordable, luxury 2 & 3 bdrms. in quiet country setting.

Army Col. Peter Brownback, the judge, said the military tribunal lacked jurisdiction over Canadian Omar Khadr because he did not meet the definition of those subject to trial under a law the U.S. Congress drafted last year. "It's not a technicality. It's another demonstration that the system simply doesn't work," said the tribunal's chief defense counsel, Marine Col. Dwight Sullivan. "Fundamentally it is a system of justice that does not comport with American values." The judge said a military review board had labeled Khadr an "enemy combatant" during a 2004 hearing in Guantanamo. But the Military Commissions Act adopted by the U.S. Congress in 2006 said only "unlawful enemy combatants" could be tried in the Guantanamo tribunals. Brownback said Khadr did not meet that strict definition because there had been no formal proceeding designating him as unlawful. Because none of the 380 foreign captives held at Guantanamo have been designated in that way, lawyers said they could not be tried unless they first faced proceedings reclassifying them as unlawful enemy combatants. Brownback dismissed the charges against Khadr, but left open the possibility that charges could be re-filed if Khadr went back before a review board and was formally reclassified. This was the latest setback for the Bush government's efforts to put the Guantanamo detainees through some form of judicial process. It was forced to rewrite the rules last year after the U.S. Supreme Court deemed the old tribunals illegal. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

(CNS)  An official of the Detroit Archdiocese denounced the media "hype" surrounding the parole of Jack Kevorkian, saying the assisted suicide proponent was being "treated as a celebrity parolee instead of the convicted murder he is." Kevorkian, a former pathologist whose medical license was suspended in 1991, left the Lakeland Correctional Facility in Coldwater June 1, accompanied his attorney, Mayer Morganroth, and "60 Minutes" correspondent Mike Wallace. His only comment was to describe the release as "a high point of life." He was expected to hold a news conference June 5. "For 10 years, Jack Kevorkian's actions resembled those of a pathological serial killer," said Ned McGrath, director of communications for the Detroit Archdiocese, in a May 31 statement. "It will be truly regrettable if he's now treated as a celebrity parolee instead of the convicted murderer he is." The 79-year-old Kevorkian served eight years in prison after being convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 10 to 25 years. He had videotaped himself helping Thomas Youk, who had Lou Gehrig's disease, to die, and the videotape was broadcast nationally on "60 Minutes," a CBS television program. Using a machine he called the "Mercitron," he was believed to have been present for at least 130 deaths. Under the terms of his parole, Kevorkian is banned from assisting in any suicides or advising anyone on how to make his suicide machine. He is permitted, however, to speak out in favor of the practice. McGrath said that Catholics in Michigan and the Detroit Archdiocese pledged "to continue our efforts on behalf of patients, their families and their caregivers to increase the knowledge -- and availability -- of medically and morally sound options for end-of-life decision-making." Dorothy Deremo, president and CEO of Hospice of Michigan, expressed hope in a statement that Kevorkian's release would be "an opportunity to shed light on the services available to people who are living with serious illnesses." Kevorkian "presented a false choice: suffer or ask for death," Deremo added. "Hospice provides compassionate, all-encompassing care that relieves suffering -- both physical and emotional." As Kevorkian was about to be released, The Gallup Poll made public the results of its latest polling, which showed that Americans are divided on the issue of physician-assisted suicide. Asked if physicians should be allowed to assist in a suicide if the patient who "has a disease that cannot be cured and is living in severe pain" requests it, 56 percent said yes and 38 percent said no. Asked whether doctor-assisted suicide is morally acceptable, 49 percent said it was and 44 said it was not. Among those who attend church weekly, 47 percent said doctors "should be allowed by law to end the patient's life by some painless means if the patient and his or her family request it," but 51 percent said they should not be allowed to do so. The results were based on telephone interviews with 1,003 U.S. adults May 10-13. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

(AHN) - Following 16 months of intense investigation by the Department of Justice and the FBI, U.S. Representative William Jefferson (D-LA) has been indicted on 16 counts related to bribery. Two others linked to the crimes have plead guilty and are cooperating with authorities, who say the Louisiana Congressman violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to a 94-page indictment filed in the Eastern District of Virginia. According to the indictment, Representative Jefferson is charged with two counts of violating of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; three counts relating to bribes by a public official; five counts of wire fraud; two counts of money laundering; one count of obstruction of justice; one count of violating the Racketeer Influence Corrupt Organization (RICO) Act and one count of violating forfeiture allegations. The charges are linked to an investigation into the securing of buisness contracts with Nigeria and other African nations. Rep. Jefferson, who has been in the House since 1991, had his Congressional offices raided in May 2006, as well as his home in Washington, D.C. FBI agents found $90,000 in cash stuffed in the Congressman's freezer; allegedly money from a $100,000 bribery deal the Louisiana Democrat was involved in. In 2006, Brett M. Pfeffer, a former aide to Jefferson, and Vernon Jackson, CEO of iGate Inc., pleaded guilty in separate cases to bribery and bribery of a public official, respectively. Both men are cooperating with investigators and may receive reduced sentences. Copyright © AHN Media Corp - All rights reserved.

Kennedy International Airport, not to mention a substantial swath of Queens. Michael Powell and William K. Rashbaum Filings portray plot as more talk than action Documents show suspects lacked money, training The men are accused of plotting to destroy a jet fuel pipeline that runs to the John F. Kennedy International Airport. (Seth Wenig/Associated Press) By Michael Powell and William K. Rashbaum, New York Times News Service | NEW YORK -- The plot as painted by law enforcement officials was cataclysmic: A home-grown Islamic terrorist had in mind detonating fuel storage tanks and pipelines and setting fire to John F. Kennedy International Airport, not to mention a substantial swath of Queens. "Had the plot been carried out, it could have resulted in unfathomable damage, deaths, and destruction," Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the US attorney in Brooklyn, said in a press release that announced charges against four men. She added at a news conference, "The devastation that would be caused had this plot succeeded are just unthinkable." Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly then stepped to the lectern with a vision only a bit less grim. "Once again, would-be terrorists have put New York City in their crosshairs," he said. Kelly said a disaster had been averted. But a reading of the criminal complaint filed by the federal authorities against the four defendants in the case -- one of them remained at large yesterday -- suggests a less than mature terror plan, a proposed effort longer on evil intent than on operational capability. Mauskopf noted in her release that the "public was never at risk" and told reporters that law enforcement "had stopped this plot long before it ever had a chance to be carried out." At its heart was a 63-year-old retired airport cargo worker, Russell Defreitas, who the complaint says talked of his dreams of inflicting massive harm, but who appeared to possess little money, uncertain training, and no known background in conceptualizing or planning a terror attack. "Capability low, intent very high," a law enforcement official said of the suspects. Some law enforcement officials and engineers also dismissed the notion that the alleged plot could have resulted in a catastrophic chain reaction; system safeguards, they said, would have stopped explosions from spreading. The complaint, filed in US District Court in Brooklyn, also suggests that at least two of the suspects had some ambivalence. They had ties with Jamaat al Muslimeen, a dangerous Islamic group that once engineered a deadly coup attempt in Trinidad and Tobago. The group allegedly had been approached about underwriting a plot. One of the men was prepared to bomb the airport but leery about killing masses of people, the complaint says. Another dropped out of the alleged plot for a time to tend to his business. In the end, the men decided to stop courting the Islamic group and resolved to shop elsewhere overseas for terror financing. One defendant, Abdul Kadir, who was arrested in Trinidad, is said to have warned the others that the Islamists in Trinidad "wanted to minimize the killing of innocents such as women and children." A third suspect, Kareem Ibrahim, 61, was also arrested in Trinidad, and a fourth, Abdel Nur, 57, remained at large. No one would second-guess the authorities for pursuing and arresting suspected plotters. One of the most enduring lessons that the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001, have taught prosecutors and FBI agents is the danger of inaction. But as with many post-Sept. 11 terror plots, the line between terrible aspiration and reality can get lost in a murky haze. In case after case, from what authorities said was a dirty bomber to the Lackawanna Six, federal prosecutors hail arrests of terrorists and disruptions of what they describe as sinister plots. But as these legal cases unfold, the public often is left groping for certainty about the true nature of threats described so graphically by the authorities. Mauskopf and Kelly declined yesterday to discuss their characterizations of the airport case. Mark J. Mershon, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office, also spoke at the press conference, and he said yesterday that his message was very clear: "I believe I spoke the simple truth at the press conference: the ambitions were horrific, the capacities were very limited, but they kept trying. Their signature was their persistence." Neal R. Sonnett, a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor who was chief of the criminal division in the US attorney's office in Miami, congratulated the FBI for fine police work in what was clearly "a prosecutable case." But he said: "There unfortunately has been a tendency to shout too loudly about such cases." "It has a bit of the gang that couldn't shoot straight to it," he said. "It would have served the federal government well to say that." A reading of the criminal complaint suggests why prosecutors and FBI agents grew so alarmed as they learned of the suspects' alleged ambitions. In taped statements attributed to Defreitas, he was unequivocal about his desire to kill many thousands of his fellow Americans. But the same papers give reason for doubt about the competence of the suspects. The details tend to suggest a distance between Defreitas's dream and any nightmarish reality. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

The name of Adnan Gulshair el-Shukrijumah, reportedly the man Usama bin Laden tapped to lead a previous plot to detonate nuclear bombs simultaneously in several U.S. cities, came up at several points in taped conversations during the probe, law-enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told the paper. Three Muslim men were nabbed Friday in the alleged plan to attack John F. Kennedy International Airport, which involved exploding a jet-fuel pipeline that snakes from New York to New Jersey. A fourth suspect is at large. Click here to read the full New York Post story. Given Shukrijumah's notoriety in the terror world and the fact that he grew up in Guyana, as did three of the suspects, investigators immediately homed in on him, the Post reported. Get complete coverage in FOXNews.com's War on Terror center. "We thought he could be the invisible hand. He's always in the shadows, particularly in &#91;the Caribbean&#93;. He's passed through it, he's known, his name came up in the conversations," one law-enforcement official told the Post. "He would have been the prize." Meanwhile, federal authorities said the informant who helped break up an alleged plot to bomb a fuel pipeline feeding the city's busiest airport was so convincing to the suspects that they actually thanked God he was with them. The suspects, accused mastermind Russell Defreitas, 63, is in custody in New York, where he will have a bail hearing on Wednesday. But two other suspects, Kareem Ibrahim and Abdul Kadir, a former member of Guyana's Parliament, were in Trinidad and will fight extradition to the United States, their lawyer, Rajid Persad, told a Trinidadian court on Monday. The two made their initial court appearance there on one count each of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act against the government of the United States. The judge set a bail hearing for June 11 and an extradition hearing on Aug. 2. The informant made several overseas trips to discuss the plot against the airport, even visiting a radical Muslim group's compound in Trinidad, officials said. He also joined the plotters on airport surveillance trips &#8212; where authorities were waiting, they said. The suspects were convinced the informant was guided by a higher purpose: The ringleader believed the informant "had been sent by Allah to be the one" to pull off the bombing, according to a federal complaint. The four-person plot, revealed Saturday, demonstrated the growing importance of informants in the government's efforts to combat terrorism, particularly as smaller radical groups become more aggressive. Tom Corrigan, a former member of the FBI-New York Police Department Joint Terrorism Task Force, said the Kennedy airport case and the recent plot to attack Fort Dix illustrated the need for inside information. Six men were arrested in a plot to attack soldiers at the New Jersey military base after an FBI informant infiltrated that group. "These have been two significant cases back-to-back where informants were used," Corrigan said. "These terrorists are in our own backyard. They may have to reach out to people they don't necessarily trust, but they need &#8212; for guns, explosives, whatever." Without informants, Corrigan said, investigators are often left with little more than educated guesswork. "In most cases, you can't get from A to B without an informant," said the ex-NYPD detective. In the Kennedy airport case, the informant was a twice-convicted drug dealer who found himself in the midst of a terrorist plot conceived as more devastating than the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. "Would you like to die as a martyr?" the informant was asked, according to the indictment. He unhesitatingly replied yes and soon was making surveillance trips around the airport &#8212; the "chicken farm," as the planners dubbed their target. Authorities said the JFK scheme was an example of homegrown terrorism. The man accused of being the mastermind, Defreitas, 63, immigrated to the U.S. more than 30 years ago, but he told the federal informant that his feelings of disgust toward his adopted homeland had lingered for years. "Before terrorism started in this country," he said in one secretly recorded conversation. Defreitas, in custody Sunday pending a bail hearing, was arrested Friday night outside Brooklyn's Lindenwood Diner &#8212; a spot once bugged by federal officials tracking former Gambino family boss John A. "Junior" Gotti. The four Muslim men accused in the JFK plot didn't turn to Pakistan, Iran or Afghanistan for support after targeting the airport, home to an average of 1,000 daily flights and 45 million passengers annually. Instead, according to a federal complaint, the informant and defendants Kareem Ibrahim and Defreitas visited a compound belonging to Jamaat al Muslimeen, a radical Islamic group known for launching a bloody 1990 coup attempt in Trinidad that involved taking the prime minister and his Cabinet hostage. It left 24 people dead. Though Jamaat al Muslimeen did have contact with the men accused in the Kennedy airport plot, it is not accused of offering them any support. The group, whose followers are largely black converts to Sunni Islam, has faded as a political force in Trinidad as its leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, fends off criminal charges of inciting violence. The rebels in the 1990 raid on Parliament surrendered and were pardoned. When Defreitas discussed his radical "brothers" with the informant, he made it clear they were not Arabs, but from Trinidad and Guyana. The complaint made clear the informant had deeply infiltrated the group. Defreitas, a retired JFK airport cargo worker, made four reconnaissance missions to the airport, authorities said. They captured each one on audio and video equipment. Ibrahim and another suspect, Abdul Kadir, were in custody in Trinidad awaiting extradition hearings. Officials identified Kadir as a former mayor of a Guyanese town and a member of the country's Parliament. Authorities in Trinidad were still seeking a fourth suspect, Abdel Nur.

In recent newspaper ads, antiabortion leaders attack Focus on the Family founder James C. Dobson for his contention that the Supreme Court's ruling upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act is a victory for their position. (By Chip Somodevilla -- Getty Images) Andrew Cohen blogs multiple times daily about the latest legal developments and issues. The Battle Of Curlin: Court Fight Over Great Horse Being Fair to Michael Vick Gonzales's Failures Broader Than Prosecutor Purge Sign Up for RSS Feed Save & Share Article At the center of the dispute is the Supreme Court's April 18 decision upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a federal law against a procedure in which a doctor partially delivers a late-term fetus before crushing its skull. Dobson and many other antiabortion leaders hailed the 5 to 4 ruling as a victory; abortion-rights organizations saw it as a defeat. But six weeks later, its consequences have been, in part, the reverse. "The Supreme Court decision totally galvanized our supporters" by raising the prospect that the court could soon overturn , the 1973 opinion that established a woman's right to choose an abortion, said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America . "Both our direct-mail and online giving got a serious bump," she said. Among antiabortion activists, meanwhile, the decision in has reopened an old split between incrementalists who support piecemeal restrictions and purists who seek a wholesale prohibition on abortions. In an open letter to Dobson that was published as a full-page ad May 23 in the Colorado Springs Gazette, Focus on the Family's hometown newspaper, and May 30 in the , the heads of five small but vocal groups called the decision "wicked," and accused Dobson of misleading Christians by applauding it. is even "more wicked than " because it is "not a ban, but a partial-birth abortion manual" that affirms the legality of late-term abortions "as long as you follow its guidelines," the ads said. "Yet, for many years you have misled the Body of Christ about the ban, and now about the ruling itself." A Focus on the Family spokesman said that Dobson would not comment. But the organization's vice president, Tom Minnery, said that Dobson rejoiced over the ruling "because we, and most pro-lifers, are sophisticated enough to know we're not going to win a total victory all at once. We're going to win piece by piece." Doctors adopted the late-term procedure "out of convenience," Minnery added. "The old procedure, which is still legal, involves using forceps to pull the baby apart in utero, which means there is greater legal liability and danger of internal bleeding from a perforated uterus. So we firmly believe there will be fewer later-term abortions as a result of this ruling." Brian Rohrbough, president of Colorado Right to Life and a signer of the ads, disagreed. "All you have to do is read the ruling, and you will find that this will never save a single child, because even though the justices say this one technique is mostly banned -- not completely banned -- there are lots of other techniques, and they even encourage abortionists to find less shocking means to kill late-term babies," he said. Another signer, the Rev. Bob Enyart, a Christian talk radio host and pastor of the Denver Bible Church, said the real issue is fundraising. "Over the past seven years, the partial-birth abortion ban as a fundraising technique has brought in over a quarter of a billion dollars" for major antiabortion groups, "but the ban has no authority to prevent a single abortion, and pro-life donors were never told that," he said. "That's why we call it the pro-life industry." In Rohrbough's view, partisan politics is also involved. "What happened in the abortion world is that groups like National Right to Life, they're really a wing of the Republican Party, and they're not geared to push for personhood for an unborn child -- they're geared to getting Republicans elected," he said. "So we're seeing these ridiculous laws like the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban put forward, and then we're deceived about what they really do." Chuck Donovan, executive vice president of the Family Research Council, a Washington advocacy group allied with Dobson, said the dispute is the most visible rift in the antiabortion movement in at least a decade. He called the ads "a bit bizarre" and said they "might be an attention-getting device" for some of the signers, which also included the heads of the American Life League, Operation Rescue/Operation Save America and the Catholic group Human Life International. "But," he added, "there are certainly a fair number of people, including in our own building, who think the [Supreme Court] decision's practical importance has been overrated -- that, practically, there may not be even one fewer abortion in the country as a result."

While robberies in the West as a whole increased 11.6 percent, Albuquerque showed only a 1.8 percent increase. Violent crime in Albuquerque decreased 2.6 percent while the West saw a 2.8 percent increase. 2005 - 2006 - % change - % change in West Rape: 285 - 286 - 0.3 - -1.4 Robbery: 1,150 - 1,171 - 1.8 - 11.6 Agg. assault: 3,182 - 3,059 - -3.8 - -1 Violent crime: 4,670 - 4,550 - -2.6 - 2.8 Burglary: 5,744 - 6,352 - 10.5 - -2.6 Larceny/theft: 20,703 - 19,890 - -3.9 - -6.3 Vehicle theft: 3,796 - 5,515 - 45 - -6.5 Property crime: 30,243 - 31,757 - 5 - -5.6 Arson: 60 - 61 - 1.6 - 4.4 Firms don't want employees to abuse sick leave 14 troops killed during weekend Report: Culture of porn hurts women The nation's homicide rate rose slightly last year but the number of robberies skyrocketed by 6 percent, preliminary FBI data released today show. The statistics were part of an overall 1.3 percent rise in violent crime across the country in 2006 - the second straight annual increase. However, car thefts, arsons and other property crimes dipped for the second straight year, the data show. The modest increase in homicide reflected a mixed bag for cities. The number of homicides in major metropolitan areas - those with at least 1 million residents - climbed by 6.7 percent. Smaller cities, meanwhile, saw their murders decrease by a collective 11.9 percent. The spike in robberies marked the highest increase in any category of crime surveyed in the FBI report, which was compiled with data from more than 11,700 law enforcement agencies nationwide. Violent crime rose in every region of the country except for the Northeast, the FBI reported. Western states saw the largest jump in violent crime, by 2.8 percent, the data show. The new numbers come amid a Justice Department push to tamp down violent crime with millions of new dollars in funds to local police and a surge of federal agents to troubled cities. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales - who took office as violent crime started to rise - has called the crackdown one of his top priorities for the remaining 18 months of his tenure at the Justice Department. In a spot of good news, violent crime grew at a slower pace than initially expected. In December, the FBI projected a 3.7 percent increase for the first six months of 2006. The year before, in 2005, violent crime rose by 2.3 percent. Property crimes decreased overall by 2.9 percent from 2005, the FBI reported. Burglaries, however, rose slightly - particularly in mid-sized cities, where the rate grew by 3.3 percent.

Blame the "tyrannical" government for that, he said. Last update: June 03, 2007 &ndash; 9:42 PM Informant exposed airport plot, officials say Parents of TB patient say he would not have flown if he thought he was a risk to others Murders, robberies rising as nation's violent crime increases Woman trying to stop vehicle leaving collision is dragged to death SOUTHFIELD, MICH. - Jack Kevorkian, the former pathologist once known as "Doctor Death," says he will never again counsel a terminally ill person on how to die. But eight years behind bars and a strict list of promises to gain parole have done nothing to mellow the blunt, passionate, combative advocate for physician-assisted suicide. In an interview Sunday, two days after his release from prison, Kevorkian, 79, let loose a rush of fierce words about a nation that failed to pass any laws allowing assisted suicide while he was in prison. Again and again, he called the government "the tyrant." He called the public "sheep." He called some of his harshest critics "religious fanatics or nuts." Kevorkian says he assisted with more than 130 suicides in the 1990s, when he drew national attention to questions about what rights people have when it comes to dying. Asked whether he would turn away a gravely ill person seeking his guidance now, he said gruffly, "I can't help them." Kevorkian, convicted in one of those 130 cases of second-degree murder, has agreed in his parole provisions not to help anyone else commit suicide. "Sorry," he said. "Don't blame me. Blame your government for passing the laws." Kevorkian seemed gloomy, too, about whether laws allowing assisted suicide would ever expand much beyond Oregon, the only state that has legalized the practice under certain circumstances. Of the United States becoming one of the countries to allow it, he said: "It'll be the last one, if it does ever. It's a tyrannical country." Kevorkian also criticized the existing Oregon law -- and other proposed legislation, including a bill being considered in the California Legislature this week -- as not going far enough. Most proposed laws require ill people to administer the lethal drugs themselves, which Kevorkian said would exclude people unable to move or swallow on their own and in need of a physician's direct help. "What they're pushing for is not complete," he said. "They always accused me of being radical. I'm not radical. I'm making sure it's complete and well done." In the interview in his lawyer's office, Kevorkian, gaunt at 126 pounds and dressed in a worn jacket, described his plans ahead for educating the public (about the Ninth Amendment, which says that rights not otherwise addressed by the Constitution are reserved for the people), recalled his years behind bars ("loud" and "boring"), and reflected on the deaths that drew so much focus to euthanasia and assisted suicide. In 1999, Kevorkian was convicted of giving a fatal injection to Thomas Youk, a 52-year-old man who had Lou Gehrig's disease. A videotape of the death was broadcast on national television, after Kevorkian gave it to "60 Minutes" along with an interview in which he challenged prosecutors to charge him with a crime. Asked whether he had any regrets about that period, Kevorkian said, mostly not. If anything, he said, he wished he had sought different legal advice. "Everything else had to be done," he said.

Rice also said that Cuba is in ''a process of change'' and that the 34-member nation OAS had to be ``ready to help the Cuban people realize their aspirations and freedoms.'' Rice dedicated about half her speech at the OAS' 37th General Assembly to energy issues, the main item on the official agenda. Then she engaged in a rare confrontational exchange with her Venezuelan counterpart, Nicol&aacute;s Maduro. ''Freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of conscience are not a thorn on the side of government,'' Rice told the meeting, referring to leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez decision not to renew the broadcast license of RCTV, an opposition station. ``They are the beginning of justice in every society.'' Citing Article 18, of the 2001 Inter-American Democratic Charter, she said OAS Secretary General Jos&eacute; Miguel Insulza should ''go to Venezuela to consult in good faith with all interested parties and to present a full report'' to the OAS. Under the article, the OAS can only intervene if the host government agrees. ''Disagreeing with your government is not unpatriotic and most certainly should not be a crime in any country, especially in a democracy,'' she said. Rice's speech drew an angry response from Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, who defended the RCTV takeover as a ''democratic, legal, just and constitutional'' way of breaking a monopoly. ''Venezuela demands respect for its sovereignty,'' he said, adding that the OAS should instead dispatch a commission to investigate whether the rights of prisoners at the Guant&aacute;namo Naval Base in Cuba are being respected. He called the proposed U.S.-Mexico border fence to keep out illegal migrants ``the wall of indignity.'' Rice asked to speak again. She said ''issues of democracy and defense of democracy are never inappropriate'' on an agenda of the OAS. ``As to issues in the United States of human rights, of how we fight the war on terror, the detention of unlawful combatants at Guant&aacute;namo, on immigration policy, on any issue, I am quite certain that it would be difficult for any commission to debate more fully, to investigate more fully, to criticize the policies of the United States government then is done every night on CNN, on ABC, on CBS, on NBC and on any number of smaller channels in the United States.'' ''That is the point of press freedom,'' she added, ``that in a democracy, the citizens of a country should have the assurance that the policies of their government will be held up for criticism by a free and independent press, without the interference of their government. The citizens of the United States have that assurance. I sincerely hope the citizens of Venezuela will have that assurance as well.'' As she was leaving the hall, Maduro said he regretted Rice would not hear his rebuttal. He said Guant&aacute;namo was ``something monstrous, only comparable to the Hitler era.'' He said the United States should allow the cameras of the new network, TVES, into the Guant&aacute;namo jail. TVES is being created to replace RCTV. ''The United States and its government, sooner or later, will have to respect the sovereignty of our government and our people,'' he said, raising his voice. On Cuba, Rice reiterated Cuba's political and economic future will be charted by the Cubans themselves, ``in Cuba.'' ``It is our responsibility as American democracies to help the Cuban people chart whatever course they freely desire.'' &#150; All Job Categories &#150; QA - Quality Control Restaurant - Food Service Skilled Labor - Trades &#150; All United States &#150; About the Real Cities Network Terms of Use & Privacy Statement About the McClatchy Company Copyright 2007 Miami Herald Media Co.

"The president of the United States has made it very clear what our policy is. That policy is supported by all the members of his cabinet and by the vice president of the United States," Rice said referring to U.S. opposition to Iran's nuclear activities. Her words came after talks with Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Moratinos in Madrid. Earlier, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency chief Mohamed ElBaradei had cautioned against military action to halt Iran's nuclear program. "I have no brief other than to make sure we don't go into another war or that we go crazily into killing each other. You do not want to give additional argument to crazy people who say 'let's go and bomb Iran'," he told BBC radio. "We have a diplomatic choice, but it's only going to succeed if we are absolutely clear with the Iranians, not muddying the message in any way," said Rice. Also in Madrid, nuclear talks between negotiators for Iran and the European Union on Thursday ended without an announcement of any breakthrough. Two rounds of sanctions have been ordered by the U.N. Security Council over Iran's nuclear program and a third round has been proposed by Washington. Iran has pledged to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United States has accused Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons under the cover of a civilian nuclear program. However, Iran has said its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.

http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/102215.html&cid Guantanamo compared to 'era of Hitler' " alt="mail" name="mail_icon_white" id="mail_icon_white" > Venezuela's foreign minister called the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay a throwback to the "era of Hitler." In a testy exchange Monday between Nicolas Maduro and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at the Organization of American States meeting in Panama City, Rice lambasted Venezuela for closing an opposition-linked television station last month. Maduro responded by accusing the United States of attempting to destabilize the Venezuelan government and violating human rights through its immigration policies and refusal to close the prison at Guantanamo. After Rice rebuked the government of President Hugo Chavez for silencing critics, Maduro again took the floor to make the Hitler remark. "[Guantanamo] is a monstrous thing, comparable only to the era of Hitler, that in this historical epoch there are clandestine prisons with faceless prisoners and nameless prisoners," Maduro said. Rice walked out of the session as Maduro began his response. "There is a confrontation today between the government of the United States and the government of Venezuela that was evident with the discussion in the OAS," the Simon Wiesenthal Center's representative observer, Sergio Widder, said after the exchange. "But this comment and allusion to Hitler is unacceptable, as it trivializes what the Holocaust was." The OAS meeting had been scheduled to discuss energy policy in the region, but has been overshadowed by the conflict between the Bush administration and the Chavez regime, including disputes over press freedom, the release of wanted terrorist Luis Posada Carriles by U.S. authorities and the general clash of power in Latin America.

One day, one storm and 182 anxious days of the season still to come. Audio and video clips News on PDAs, cellphones Join Bob King's blog Sound off on the forum Everything you need to know to keep yourself safe: Should you stay or go? WPB Storm Expo June 9-10 S. Fla. emergency resources Site map and A-Z guide photos and all of today's Sound off in the forum The formation of Barry just 17 hours into hurricane season was a coincidence - a product in part of warm gulf waters - and not an indicator that conditions will be any riper for hurricanes this year, meteorologists said. Barry is a mixed bag: It threatens to bring dangerous waves, coastal flooding up to 5 feet and rainfall of 3 to 6 inches in the Florida Keys north through southeast Georgia. But it also brings desperately needed rainfall to drought-stricken South Florida and could drop as much as 5 inches in isolated areas. &#34;It&#39;s a weaker tropical storm, on the lower end of the scale,&#34; said Robert Molleda, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. &#34;However, it needs to be watched and taken seriously.&#34; By Friday night, Barry had dropped between a half-inch and an inch in most areas of Palm Beach County. About 2 to 4 inches are expected by the end of the weekend. Molleda warned South Floridians that heavy downpours could flood some roads and poor-drainage areas. Sustained winds could reach 20 to 25 mph across coastal regions, and scattered thunderstorms could produce higher gusts inland. Sustained winds of 20 mph were expected overnight Friday, with gusts up to 35 mph, meteorologists said. This morning&#39;s weather will look a lot like Friday&#39;s, with rain falling steadily before tapering off in the afternoon. Thunderstorms are still possible Sunday. At 11 p.m., Barry was about 270 miles southwest of Tampa and was moving north-northeast at about 9 mph, with maximum sustained winds near 50 mph. Forecasters expected Barry to turn to the northeast and increase its speed, though no significant change in strength was expected before possible landfall. Forecasters issued a tropical storm warning, meaning tropical storm conditions were expected within 24 hours, for the Gulf Coast from Bonita Beach to Keaton Beach west of Gainesville. A less-severe tropical storm watch, meaning such conditions were expected within 36 hours, was issued from north of Keaton Beach to St. Marks. As Barry evolved, it posed a difficult challenge for hurricane forecasters, who spent much of Friday debating whether to call it a tropical storm or a subtropical storm. A subtropical storm is a meteorological hybrid that produces winds of at least 39 mph but lacks an intense central core and the circular shape of a tropical storm or hurricane. &#34;The big issue is what is this thing?&#39;&#39; forecaster Jack Beven said. &#34;Some storms just don&#39;t fit neatly into the definitions.&#39;&#39; In the end, a burst of activity near Barry&#39;s center compelled Lixion Avila, the lead forecaster on duty, to designate it as a tropical storm. Forecasters have said they expect this hurricane season to be busier than normal, but they stressed that June storms such as Barry are not unusual. The National Weather Service said it expects 13 to 17 tropical storms, with seven to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to five in the strong category. Friday also marked the first of 12 days of tax breaks on hurricane-supply purchases. Molleda said that if people are apathetic at the start of hurricane season, Barry could be a blessing in disguise. &#34;As long as they don&#39;t really get impacted by it, an early storm can be a good thing,&#34; he said. &#34;Perhaps it will motivate them to get ready.&#34; Barry formed more than three weeks after the first named storm of the year, Subtropical Storm Andrea, developed off Florida&#39;s east coast. Andrea skirted the southern Atlantic coast. Rain from Barry won&#39;t bring South Florida close to normal rainfall amounts, but it certainly will help, officials said. &#34;This is a good reprieve,&#34; said Randy Smith, a South Florida Water Management District spokesman. &#34;This will give us a week or so, maybe more, in which people won&#39;t have to water as much.&#34; The rains also could raise Lake Okeechobee&#39;s water level above its current record low, Smith said. How much more rain do we need? &#34;To really alleviate the drought conditions, we&#39;re going to need anywhere from 30 to 40 inches,&#34; said Kim Brabander, a weather service meteorologist.

Violent crime increased 1.3 percent last year over 2005, with robbery rising 6 percent and murder and non-negligent manslaughter 0.3 percent, the FBI said in its preliminary annual crime report released today. Property crime, which includes motor vehicle thefts and larceny, decreased 2.9 percent. The report may fuel critics of the Bush administration&#39;s crime policies, including many police chiefs and mayors who say the rise in crime is the result of federal funding cuts. Last week, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales proposed new legislation that would increase penalties for some violent crimes and restore mandatory minimum sentences. ``It doesn&#39;t appear that the current data reveal nationwide trends,&#39;&#39; Gonzales said at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives headquarters in Washington last week. ``Rather, they show local increases in certain communities.&#39;&#39; According to the report, the rise in violent crime was greatest, with a 3.2 percent increase, in cities with populations between 250,000 and 499,999 and between 25,000 to 49,999. Cities with 1 million or more residents had the biggest rise in murders, 6.7 percent. Forcible rapes fell by 1.9 percent and aggravated assaults were down 0.7 percent. Brian Roehrkasse, a Justice Department spokesman, said today&#39;s report ``shows that overall crime remains historically low in America.&#39;&#39; The 1.3 percent rise, he added, ``is still of concern and the reason why the attorney general has acted to expand federal efforts to combat violent crime.&#39;&#39; In 2005, violent crime in the U.S. rose 2.3 percent -- the first increase since 2001. The FBI collected its data from 11,723 law enforcement agencies. The preliminary figures may change slightly when the bureau releases its final annual report in September.

Anthony Williams, stationed near Fallujah, Iraq, sports a USMC tattoo on his back. New Marine Corps policy restricts 'excessive' tattoos. New Marine Corps policy on tattoos is a farce decision by Marine commandant Gen. James T. Conway to further restrict the types and locations of tattoos that Marines can have exposed a leadership flaw within The Few, The Proud. The policy, which went into effect April 1, prohibits large tattoos below the elbow and knee. It is designed to stop Marines from getting large "sleeve" tattoos. In the words of Gen. Conway, "Some Marines have taken the liberty of tattooing themselves to a point that is contrary to our professional demeanor and the high standards America has come to expect from us. I believe tattoos of an excessive nature do not represent our traditional values." Whose values? Gen. Conway's? His comments indicate that he is a man on a mission to force his own "traditional" values on the Marine Corps as a whole--and that's unacceptable, especially at a time when our nation is at war. In fact, at a time when the Marines are having difficulty meeting recruiting goals, it's foolish, irresponsible, and lacking sound judgment. Gen. Conway owes it to America to concentrate on issues that actually matter to the security of our nation and the accomplishment of all missions to that end. In the world of leadership, the most successful leaders are selfless; they can put their own personal desires aside and focus on what's best for the organization and the people they serve. In recent articles in various publications, Gen. Conway talks about expecting and having been prepared to address more questions and resistance about the new policy from his troops during recent visits to Iraq and ships in the Persian Gulf. To his surprise, most questions were focused on equipment issues and other mission-oriented topics, and he heard very little about the new tattoo policy. Could this be due to the fact that the Marines actually engaged in fighting this war on terrorism have better leadership skills--or at least a more appropriate set of priorities--than the general? This issue hit close to home for me when a good friend of mine, and an eight-year Marine Corps veteran, was denied reenlistment due to a tattoo. That's right: An individual who is well qualified and could be operational again in very short order will not be serving his country due to a tattoo on his chest. This tattoo is in a location that will not be visible in any required Marine Corps uniform, except possibly during swim qualification--yet he was thereby denied reenlistment. I can't begin to comprehend the ignorance and shortsightedness associated with this decision.

I also think its a good thing you held the "tramp stamp " comment to yourself. I think some women in Iraq would like a tattoo or two, just because she can. Lord knows they deserve that chance. Thats also on the freedom agenda. That's "old school" thinking for ya there folks.

Jun 2, 2007 at 11:47 AM PDT Jun 2, 2007 at 1:02 PM PDT MIAMI (AP) - Tropical Storm Barry weakened into a tropical depression as it moved through Tampa Bay on Saturday, though its rains brought some relief to the drought-parched region. Forecasters discontinued the tropical storm warnings and watches issued for stretches of the Gulf Coast. The depression's sustained winds had slowed to near 35 mph and it was moving north-northeast at about 23 mph. The storm made landfall in the Tampa Bay area around 10 a.m. EDT, according to Daniel Brown, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center. "The landfall in a case like this is kind of insignificant," Brown said. In Mexico, Tropical Storm Barbara made landfall Saturday on the southern Pacific coast near the Guatemala border, an area notoriously vulnerable to flooding. With maximum winds of nearly 50 mph and higher gusts, Barbara was centered just southwest of the Mexican city of Tapachula. The storm was heading northeast at 7 mph, and was expected to weaken as it continues moving inland over southeast Mexico and western Guatemala, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm warning was in effect from Sipacate, Guatemala, to Barra de Tonala, Mexico, and the hurricane center warned that Barbara could unleash life-threatening flooding and mudslides. Heavy rains were reported. Rain was falling throughout drought-stricken Florida and Georgia, where the dry conditions have fed wildfires for weeks. "We're hoping several of these fires will not be a problem anymore," said the Florida Division of Forestry's Mike Newell. "It's too early to tell right now. Everybody's basically waiting for the rain to stop to go out and see what's going on." The depression was expected to drop 3 to 6 inches of rain on parts of those states, along with South Carolina and North Carolina on Saturday. Isolated areas could get up to 10 inches of rain. The National Weather Service said isolated tornadoes over central Florida were possible. By Saturday morning, Barry had brought nearly 6 inches of rain to Melbourne and nearly 7 inches to West Palm Beach. "It'll help a little bit, but everyone is so far below rainfall that we're still going to be under drought conditions," said Kim Brabander, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. "To really alleviate the drought conditions we're going to need anywhere from 30 to 40 inches of rain." A tropical storm warning was canceled after being issued from Bonita Beach on Florida's southwest coast northward to Keaton Beach, near the state's Big Bend area. A tropical storm watch for the area between Keaton Beach west to St. Marks, south of Tallahassee, also was canceled. The storm developed Friday, the first official day of a hurricane season that forecasters have said they expect to be busier than normal. The National Weather Service said it expects 13 to 17 tropical storms, with seven to 10 becoming hurricanes and three to five in the strong category. "There is no correlation at all between activity in the early part of the season and later parts," said Lixion Avila, a hurricane specialist at the center. Barry formed more than three weeks after the first named storm of the year - Subtropical Storm Andrea - developed off Florida's eastern coast. Andrea skirted the southern Atlantic coast but caused minimal damage. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free! The latest news video from KOMO.

Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, the two front runners, were attacked aggressively by third-placed John Edwards, a former senator, for timidly following the countryâs anti-war sentiment in voting against the Iraq spending Bill instead of taking the lead, a charge that led to sharp retorts about Edwardsâ own late decision to oppose the war. Obama jabbed back saying he had always been against the war while Edwards was "about 4 1/2 years late" in laying claim to the role of leader on the issue. Clinton meanwhile defended her early support for the war, ducking and weaving charges that she had not even read pre-war intelligence reports. Trailing far behind the top three in polls, other Democratic candidates, senators Joe Biden and Chris Dodd, New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, former Alaska governor Mike Gravel and Congressman Dennis Kucinich, jostled for attention in the two-hour, ad-free debate. Except for providing some sound bytes, none of them offered any coherent roadmap of US foreign policy vis-Ã -vis Iraq or the war on terrorism, except to say they wanted a troop withdrawal. The format admittedly did not allow any lengthy dissertation, but even in the limited time they had, they waffled. Asked by a discerning member of the audience how they could reconcile the US push for democracy with support for an increasingly odious dictatorship in Pakistan, the candidates ducked the question and blathered about the hunt for bin Laden. Clinton said it was clear that Musharraf is not moving towards democracy and is solidifying his rule and becoming anti-democratic with his handling of the chief justice affair, but she ended the critique by lamely saying the US still depended on him to control the tribal areas. She had suggested to the White House appointment of a high-level presidential envoy to get Pakistan and Afghanistan working together in the war on terror but the plea had fallen on deaf ears, she said. Other candidates did not even touch on the issue of Pakistan and democracy, even though many US commentators have recognised the country and its military-fundamentalist alliance as being a principle cause of terrorism across the world. Aware perhaps that their nominal differences on Iraq was being amplified, Hillary Clinton later said "We all believe that we need to try to end this war," reminding everyone that "In two nights you're going to have the Republican candidates here. They all support the war. They all support the president. They all supported the escalation. Each of us is trying in our own way to bring the war to an end."

The castle is an attempt to be the world's tallest, but the official measurement will be today as part of the Sun Fun Festival. VIDEO: See the sand castle, before and after damage Myrtle Beach has built the tallest sand castle in the world - again. Officials announced Monday that this year's effort was measured at 49.55 feet before Tropical Storm Barry damaged the structure this weekend. Even after Barry's wrath, the castle measured 43.12 feet, easily besting the previous record of 37.9 feet, Mike Wooten of DDC Engineering Inc. announced at a press conference this morning in front of the sandcastle on Ocean Boulevard and Sixth Avenue North. Myrtle Beach broke the record last summer, but the record was broken soon after by the Virginia Beach Neptune Festival. Wind and rain from the storm damaged the roughly 40-foot-tall sand castle overnight Saturday and into Sunday. The structure was built as part of the annual Sun Fun Festival. Most of the damage was done to the top and the north-facing side of the castle, including the face of a knight and a Hawaiian Tropic logo. Much of the structure's Boulevard-facing features, including a dragon, remained intact. A crew worked Saturday to reconstruct some of the damaged logos when the storm subsided, said Nicole Aiello, spokeswoman for the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce, which sponsors the festival. Nobody tried to repair the marred castle Sunday because the crew, from a Florida-based sand sculpting company, went home Saturday night. The castle probably lost about a foot in height because of irreparable damage to the spire at its peak, Aiello said. Sculptors molded 300 truck loads of sand from the top down to build the castle, and there was no way for them to repair the top without damaging the rest of it, she said. Murrells Inlet residents Dick and Carol Lajoie, who braved drizzle and hovering storm clouds Sunday to photograph the castle, said it's the biggest castle they've seen. "It still looks good," Dick Lajoie said. "You understand that nature is going to take its course." The storm dumped 2.16 inches of rain on the Myrtle Beach area over the weekend, said meteorologist Steven Pfaff with the National Weather Service in Wilmington, N.C. Barry had weakened considerably and was no longer a tropical storm by the time it hit the S.C. coast, he said. Nonetheless, it brought much-needed rain to parched areas across the state, he said. Before the storm, the Myrtle Beach area had gotten 4 inches less rain than it normally gets during the spring, Pfaff said. About 1 to 3 inches fell throughout the state, easing a dry spell that affected area farmers and gardeners. The chance of rain Sunday night was 30 percent, lessening to 20 percent today. A west wind is expected to blow between 10 and 17 mph today. There was a threat of dangerous rip currents and beach erosion Sunday for the Grand Strand and Brunswick County, N.C. Pfaff said he'd gotten no reports of flooding or erosion, but he said the storm made conditions rough for boaters on Sunday. Online editor Dwayne McLemore contributed to this report.

(AP) &#151; Michigan's law aimed at banning a controversial abortion procedure is unconstitutional despite a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld a federal ban, an appeals court ruled Monday. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a Detroit district judge's opinion that the 2004 Legal Birth Definition Act places an "undue burden" on a woman's right to choose an abortion. The appeals court said if Michigan had copied an Ohio law that has been upheld in the 6th Circuit, it would have been "virtually guaranteed" a favorable result on appeal. "It instead opted to use statutory language that pushed almost every boundary that the Supreme Court has imposed for these types of laws," the three-judge panel said. Proponents of the Michigan law have said they were attempting to ban a procedure they call "partial-birth" abortion. Previous attempts by state lawmakers to stop the abortion procedure were struck down by federal courts in 1997 and 2001. Abortion rights groups have said the latest law overreached and would have banned pre-viable abortions including the most common method of second-trimester abortion, dilation and evacuation. The appeals court agreed with that position, ruling that unlike the federal ban, Michigan's ban goes too far. Ohio's law was worded explicitly to not apply to D&E, the appeals court said. "The Michigan statute contains no similar exception or clear definitions that would avoid sweeping up protected abortion procedures within its prohibition," the court wrote. The Legislature approved the abortion law in June 2004. Hundreds of thousands of voters signed petitions that allowed the bill to become law with only the approval of the House and Senate &mdash; both of which were controlled by Republicans at the time &mdash; after Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm vetoed it.

"It was important," said graduate Caisha Gailes. "I feel like I worked hard all these years just for that moment." Student Slams Classmates in Graduation Speech Judge Blocks Ky. Schools Graduation Prayer But as Gailes, an honor student, crossed the stage late last month to accept her diploma, the members of the audience cheered. According to school administrators, this celebratory display for Gailes and four other students warranted punishment. They withheld the students' diplomas because family and friends violated a no-applause rule during the school's graduation ceremony. "When I was walking across the stage that, I don't know, I had a big smile across my face," said graduate Nadia Trent. Trent said her smile faded away as she heard the cheering because she knew the consequences. Galesburg High School started the ban two years ago after some parents complained of rowdy behavior during that year's commencement. "They had quite a bit of disruption -- real loud noisemakers, air horns," said Galesburg High School principal Tom Chiles. In April, school officials sent a contract home for parents to sign. It warned of the consequences of cheering that could disrupt the ceremony. The strict policy is not the only thing in question. Gailes and others question who was punished. Of the five students denied diplomas, all were minorities -- one Hispanic and the remainder African American. "It doesn't matter how hard you work, you'll still get discriminated against," Gailes said. Chiles dismissed the idea of discrimination. He said many other minorities graduated without incident. "It's ludicrous," he said. "The last thing I want to do as an educator was upset someone on their commencement day." Read All 60 Comments and Post Your Own WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

Federal authorities have announced a massive indictment against Democrat Representative William Jefferson that details his involvement in a 16-month public corruption probe that culminated with an FBI videotape of him accepting the cash. Federal agents subsequently raided Jeffersonâs home and found the money, in marked bills, stashed in his freezer and wrapped in aluminum foil. The indictment, which is being issued in U.S. District Court in Alexandria Virginia, is more than an inch thick and outlines a plethora of evidence against the nine-term congressman. Justice Department officials say the 63-year-old Jefferson could be sentenced to prison for the rest of his life A lot of key evidence has come from two Jefferson associates who have struck plea bargains with prosecutors in exchange for their cooperation. One is Brett Pfeffer, a former congressional aide who admitted soliciting bribes on Jeffersonâs behalf and the other is a telecommunications executive (Vernon Jackson) who pleaded guilty to paying Jefferson about $1 million in exchange for the lawmakerâs assistance securing deals in various African nations. Not surprisingly, Jefferson maintains his innocence and claims that a precedent-setting raid of his Capitol Hill office was unconstitutional because it trampled on congressional independence and violated the constitutionally established separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of A federal judge authorized last yearâs 18-hour FBI searchâthe first ever at a Capitol Hill office--which led to the seizure of records, equipment and other incriminating evidence. Last month Jefferson argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that the raid was unconstitutional. Judicial Watch filed an stating that the Constitutionâs Speech or Debate Clause, which protects members of Congress from âintimidation by the executive and accountability before a possible hostile judiciary,â does not make the search of Jeffersonâs office unconstitutional. The Speech or Debate Clause, the brief states, only protects members of Congress conducting legislative actions.

The court's decision reversed a lower-court ruling that had ordered reforms to Missouri's lethal injection procedures.

No one on the ground was hurt when the twin-engine Piper Seneca came to rest atop a garage, said Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane was approaching Cable Airport about 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of Los Angeles when it lost power and crashed into three homes. None caught fire. The plane departed from Van Nuys Airport about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest from Upland. "They were on approach when the pilot reported engine problems," Gregor said.

Cheney does his best work by proxy. Anyone looking for public evidence of a major rift between Cheney and Rice will be sorely disappointed.

Cheney's aides and other loyalists he has installed in the government wield enormous power on his behalf, even as they provide him with plausible deniability. (See, for instance, the Scooter Libby case, discussed below.) writes in The Washington Post: "Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice insisted Friday that Vice President Cheney fully supports a diplomatic course in the dispute with Iran over its nuclear program, denying claims of divisions among President Bush's foreign policy advisers." "QUESTION: If I may, Madame Secretary, you've been pushing diplomatic efforts and making that heard loud and clear your message, and you're making extraordinary efforts -- or an extraordinary offer, rather -- to talk. But can you assure us that Vice President Cheney does not want to use military action on Iran to deal with its nuclear policy? Because there's a perception of a divide within the Administration. "SECRETARY RICE: First, let me be very clear. The President of the United States has made very clear what our policy is. That policy is supported by all of the members of his cabinet and by the Vice President of the United States. The President has made clear that we are on a course that is a diplomatic course, but it is a diplomatic course that is backed up by disincentives for Iran to continue its activities." writes in the New York Times: "Ms. Rice's assurance came as senior officials at the State Department were expressing fury over reports that members of Vice President Dick Cheney's staff have told others that Mr. Cheney believes the diplomatic track with Iran is pointless, and is looking for ways to persuade Mr. Bush to confront Iran militarily. "In a news conference on Friday, Ms. Rice maintained that Mr. Cheney supported her strategy of trying to deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions through diplomacy. A senior Bush administration official separately denied that there was a deep divide between Ms. Rice and Mr. Cheney on Iran. "But, the official said, 'The vice president is not necessarily responsible for every single thing that comes out of the mouth of every single member of his staff.' The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about any divide within the administration. "The reports about hawkish statements by members of Mr. Cheney's staff first surfaced last week in The Washington Note, an influential blog put out by Steve Clemons of the left-leaning New America Foundation. The reports have alarmed European diplomats, some of whom fear that the struggle over Iran's nuclear program may evolve into a decision by the Bush administration to resort to force against Iran." when it came out, but it's worth reviewing. "On one flank are the diplomats, and on the other is Vice President Cheney's team and acolytes -- who populate quite a wide swath throughout the American national security bureaucracy," Clemons writes.

Robyn Beck / AFP / Getty In what his campaign billed as a major address on immigration today in Miami, Sen. John McCain reiterated his support for the controversial legislation currently before Congress that has caused some conservatives to turn their backs on the former front-runner for the G.O.P. nomination. In an exclusive interview with TIME, McCain acknowledged that his support of the bill, which is backed by President Bush, has hurt him with the Republican base and could end his quest for the nomination. But he told TIME: "It would be worth it, because it's a matter of national security, it's a matter of economic security, and it's a matter of what kind of nation we are." McCain and Romney's War of Words Their immigration bill debate shows the candidates' different characters: hard-nosed dealmaker vs. smooth operator Immigration Reform: Still a Band-Aid Viewpoint: The latest deal on immigration policy addresses some of the problems &#151; but won't change much In his speech to a meeting of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, McCain went beyond the issue of whether the legislation grants "amnesty" to illegal aliens &#151; the focus of most of the conversative complaints &#151; and stressed what he called the "humanitarian" reasons for reform. What critics deride as a "special path" to citizenship, he said in his speech, is special only in the sense that "it is harder, longer and more expensive than the path offered to those immigrants who come here legally." The Senator also went to unusual lengths to sympathetically portray the yearning for a better life among immigrants. In emotional terms he described the deaths suffered by those attempting to cross "the trackless deserts of Arizona, people who broke our laws, not to harm us, but to possess for themselves the ideals and opportunities cherished here." While polls suggest that a slim majority of Republican voters support the immigration bill, opposition to its provision allowing citizenship has draw many attacks from conservatives within the party. Last week, President Bush dismissed opponents of the bill as "spreading fear," provoking sharp responses from typically reliable Administration allies such as Rush Limbaugh (who told his listeners the President stood to "lose some of you"). "I wish we could raise the level of dialogue on this issue," McCain told TIME. McCain's defiant speech could further inflame this divisive conversation. The Washington that the Republican National Committee has seen its small-donor contributions fall 40% since the immigration debate began in earnest last month, and that staffers link the decline directly to the issue: "Every donor in 50 states we reached has been angry, especially in the last month and a half, and for 99% of them immigration is the No. 1 issue." McCain, a co-author of the compromise legislation, is alone among the front-runners for the G.O.P. nomination who supports it. In his speech, McCain took a careful shot at his fellow candidates critical of the measure, asserting that those who reject his compromise, "especially if they are a candidate for President... should have the responsibility and courage to propose another way." He added pointedly: "To want the office so badly that you would intentionally make our country's problems worse might prove you can read a poll or take a cheap shot, but it hardly demonstrates presidential leadership." This jab was in keeping with the particularly feisty attitude that the McCain campaign has shown lately. He recently criticized fellow G.O.P. candidate Mitt Romney for his wavering views on immigration, mocking the former governor's spotty gun rights record as well as accusations that he's employed illegal immigrants: "Maybe he can get out his small varmint gun and drive those Guatemalans off his yard," McCain said. More recently, an anonymous McCain staffer concluded a dueling series of press releases about the Iraq spending bill by taking a swipe at Democratic candidate Barack Obama's inexperience: "Obama wouldn't know the difference between an RPG and a bong." But McCain told TIME that such combativeness came only as a response to others' attacks and insisted that his campaign does not intend to go on the offensive. "I've had conversations with the people that are close to me," he said. "We're not gonna do that. It's not helpful to me to get my message and my vision out. Now, you can't let an attack go unanswered, but at the same time you don't have to get into some kind of catfight." Asked specifically about his staffer's retort to Obama, he said, "I thought that that was inappropriate and whoever said that should not have said that." He added: "If it happens again, I'll fire the person who said it." When reminded that he laughed at the line when it was read back to him during a conference call with reporters, he said, "I think it was funny, but I still think it was inappropriate." In the interview, McCain also underscored his belief in the "surge" strategy in Iraq. The New York that the White House is considering reducing the troop strength there by at least half as soon as next year, but McCain contended that Bush, in personal conversations, has reiterated his support for a strong presence in the country. "Some people in the State Department and the Pentagon are trying to find the exit sign," said McCain, but "I don't see this President wavering. He may be, but I don't see it. He's committed to seeing this thing through as long as possible."

Make this your home page Search: This Site | You Yell, You Lose Diploma Steve Trainor - WMBD/WYZZ-TV Friday, Jun 1, 2007 @06:39pm WMBD / WYZZ-TV -GALESBURG -- After some over-the-top celebrations two years ago during the graduation ceremony at Galesburg High School, the district instituted new rules. Attorneys say the district can legally hold onto the diploma as it tries to set an example to ensure an orderly & respectful graduation. But so far, any lesson is lost in confusion, sadness, and anger. "I think I deserve it. I just graduated with honors," complains Caisha Gayles. She doesn&#39;t understand, just because someone cheered while she stepped up for a certificate, she&#39;s not going to get her diploma. The rules, instituted in 2005 say &#39;No outbursts or noisemakers.&#39; Family & friends were told to be quiet. Gayles says "I&#39;m no longer a part of your school, why can&#39;t I have my diploma and I can get out of your hair and you can get out of mine." Nadia Trent, another grad, wonders "I don&#39;t know why they should blame me for something I have no control over." Trent&#39;s family insists they were quiet. "There was people that went across that stage and they yelled and they got their diploma," her mother notes. Joel Estes, District Assistant Superintendent explains, "We want for all kids to have their names read and have their families be able to hear their names without celebration that&#39;s over the top." Cody Mixon, another grad countered Estes&#39; argument. Says Mixon: "I mean if they would have went crazy and really had air horns and people would have kept screamin&#39; and delayed the process then that&#39;s a just punishment but that didn&#39;t happen." Estes admits, "The kids are truly in the middle and we are looking at ways to try to help identify who were the people that caused the disruption." The five grads were also barred from a class-wide post-graduation party -- and didn&#39;t take any pictures that day -- they were all crying. "I guess we&#39;ll never get that memory back," Nadia mulled. Her mom insists there will be a fight. "I&#39;m going to talk to a lawyer if I have to, I&#39;m gonna fight to get my baby her diploma. I can&#39;t get her graduation party back but I&#39;m gonna get her diploma." How or if they&#39;ll get their diplomas was still under discussion. Copyright (c) 1998- 2007 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

LOUIS WEB SITE ST. LOUIS CITY / COUNTY NEWS OF THE WEIRD ST. LOUIS' BEST BRIDAL MAPS & YELLOW PAGES Appeals court judge to retire, return to private practice &#8212; A state appeals court judge said Friday that he was leaving the bench to return to private legal practice. Judge Edwin H. Smith has been on the Missouri Court of Appeals' Western District since being appointed by Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan in October 1995. He was its chief judge from July 2004 through June 2006. "He is experienced and is know- ledgeable in almost every aspect of the law, making him invaluable to our court," Judge Victor C. Howard, current chief judge of that court, said in a written statement on Smith's retirement. Smith will retire July 6. He is leaving to be a partner in the Shughart Thomson and Kilroy law firm, practicing corporate law in the firm's St. Joseph office. Howard said Smith was years away from required retirement, but he said his departure was an example of how hard it was to keep judges on the bench rather than pursuing more lucrative work in the private sector. "We in the judiciary are resigned to the fact that at the present levels of compensation, it will become increasingly more difficult to retain judges with Judge Smith's credentials," he said. Previously, Smith was presiding judge of the circuit court that covers Andrew and Buchanan counties.

"It would be painful for me, but I'd have to refuse them, because I gave my word that I won't do it again," Kevorkian told CBS's "60 Minutes" in an interview following his release from prison on Friday after serving eight years for a second-degree murder conviction. Instead, he said he would "work with activist groups trying to get it legalized ... either through legislatures or through courts if possible." Kevorkian, who said he didn't feel like a free man since being on parole constituted "a virtual tether," said he did not regret helping terminally ill patient Tom Youk die in 1998. The tape of the procedure led to Kevorkian's conviction. "Why would I regret that?" he told reporter Mike Wallace, adding that Youk's "life didn't measure up anymore," by the patient's own standards and choice. Kevorkian contended that even with only Oregon having an assisted suicide law on the books, "Doctors now are sneaking around and doing it." "There's where the law creates immorality in medicine," Kevorkian said. "Any ... medical act should never be done in an atmosphere of fear and concern and secrecy." Kevorkian thwarted four attempts by prosecutors to convict him and flouted a Michigan ban on assisted suicide aimed at him. State regulators revoked his medical license in 1991. As to his own health, Kevorkian, 79, said he is "just fair ... That liver disease is a fright ... it concerns me." But, he insisted, he is "content" with his life now.

As Iraq dominated last night&rsquo;s Democratic debate, expect CNN&rsquo;s Wolf Blitzer to burrow in hard on immigration when he gets the Republicans on his set on Tuesday night. Sen. John McCain make a preemptive strike this morning at a hotel in Coral Gables, Fla., where he will go before the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce to make a forceful defense of the legislation that he helped broker and that President Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush ardently support. He has an inviting backdrop from Jonathan Weisman of The Washington Post , who reports on the front page this morning: &ldquo;After a week at home with their constituents, the Senate architects of a delicate immigration compromise are increasingly convinced that they will hold together this week to pass an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, with momentum building behind one unifying theme: Today's immigration system is too broken to go unaddressed." &ldquo;Amnesty&rdquo; now is a political dirty word &ndash; the favorite slur of the bill&rsquo;s opponents. But it was not always thus. The Googling monkeys discovered that McCain himself embraced the term during a news conference a few years ago in his office in Tucson, Ariz. &ldquo;McCain Pushes Amnesty, Guest-Worker Program,&rdquo; reported the Tucson Citizen of May 29, 2003. The senator is quoted as saying: &ldquo;Amnesty has to be an important part because there are people who have lived in this country for 20, 30 or 40 years, who have raised children here and pay taxes here and are not citizens. That has to be a component of it.&rdquo; The newspaper also quoted McCain as saying: &ldquo;I think we can set up a program where amnesty is extended to a certain number of people who are eligible and at the same time make sure that we have some control over people who come in and out of this country.&rdquo; Not a member?

McCainland points out that different people have given the word different meetings at different times for their own political purposes, but that the bottom line is that the current bill is not amnesty, for reasons McCain articulates in the text of his Coral Gables remarks: &ldquo;Those undocumented workers who declare themselves, pass criminal background checks, prove their employment, pay fines, taxes, learn English and study American civics may be offered eventually, and I stress eventually, a path to citizenship. Critics of the bill attack this as amnesty and a special path to citizenship that is denied to lawful immigrants. Both charges are false.&rdquo; In addition to personalizing the issue from the point of view of a border-state senator, McCain&rsquo;s speech flays opponents who have not offered their own plans. In remarks that do not mention former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney but are squarely aimed at him, McCain says: &ldquo;Pandering for votes on this issue, while offering no solution to the problem, amounts to doing nothing. And doing nothing is silent amnesty.&rdquo; &ldquo;The politics of Washington have encouraged us to leave solutions to the toughest problems for another unluckier generation of leaders. Problems are left unsolved year after year, because we fear the political consequences of seriously addressing them or value their utility as political attacks in our campaigns. &hellip; To do nothing now would be an unconscionable abrogation of our responsibilities to defend the security, prosperity and values of our country. &hellip; I welcome any attempt to meet our responsibility to fix our broken borders and immigration system. Our proposal has provoked criticism from some on both the left and right. Compromises usually do. People of good will, who take their responsibilities seriously, argue variously that our ideas are too tough or not tough enough. I do not question the sincerity of their convictions or their purpose in proposing other ways to address the problem. There is one premise most of us agree on: the status quo is unacceptable. &hellip; Continue reading our story &#187; Page: read all 11 comments Replies: 11 Viewed: 22 Date: Jun. 4, 2007 - 8:43 AM EST McCain is plain and simple a MEAN, OLD, SENILE, man. I guess his age just finally caught up with him..He simply can't stand it when anyone disagrees with him. He and Rudy have serious personality disorders, much like Bush. A good bill is better than no bill, what hogwash!! And Rudy and Mccain still need to explain why if 911 happened while we had a Republican President, a Republican congress, and a Republican Mayor of NY, just why is it I can only trust a Republican to keep me safe. I want a President that's good at preventing terrorism, not one that knows how to mop up after a terrorist attack. Date: Jun. 4, 2007 - 9:11 AM EST When will these debates start to focus on the possible avenues of our efforts in Iraq? We've heard Democrats insist we get out. We've heard some Republicans say our being there is a worthwhile and necessary effort. In the meantime Our forces there, while succeeding in the specific areas they operate in, are far to little to late. Americans won't have the patience for a few more years worth of propping up an Iraqi govt. which still appears to refuse to take the hard-nosed steps required to weed out insurgent influences of both native sides. This problem, is in addition to Iranian and al-Qaeda interferences. One imagines that insurgent influences are now beyond simple rebellion of disparate interests, becoming institutionalized. Can it be long before health care, vacation, and retirement benefits are offered to shiites and sunis fighting and killing each other's civilians? Even the most ardent supporters of Bush policies in Iraq must be wondering to themselves if an Iraq at relative peace with itself is even possible. The tradition of conquest&rule in the middle east is set in concrete. Most Iraqis now living were born and raised under Baathist mafia rule. Both sides want power and revenge. Policing all that, should not be the responsibility of our troops, given that there continues to be little true cooperation with Iraqi leaders. The question: "What do we do then", has not been asked. Do we have ANY responsibility in Iraq, given that we broke it? Pres. Bush is failing to give us the answer. So are all these current titans who claim the wisdom to deal with it all. Date: Jun. 4, 2007 - 10:49 AM EST McCain has many fine qualities, but unfortunately he doesn't listen to the rank & file of his own party. Not a good thing for a primary candidate. Mainstream Republicans want ENFORCEMENT of U.S. immigration policy first & foremost. To heck with 'reform'. We want border security and immigrant RESPECT for the laws of the land. Dealing with those who reside here illegally is something that can just as easily be addressed AFTER the enforcement debacle is fixed. Location: Salem, United States Date: Jun. 4, 2007 - 11:44 AM EST Blue Collar, Thanks. It is time the trumpet is sounded on these candidates. (Notice the time your post hit the line.) Date: Jun. 4, 2007 - 12:02 PM EST Wolf Blitzer is a complete lightweight. I thought Chris Matthews was bad, but Wolf was even worse. The Senate is proposing massively increasing legal immigration, which will lead to even more illegal immigration and which will have a disastrous impact across the board, including possibly having a net retirement cost of over $2.5 trillion. And, all Blitzer can do is ask them to repeat what's on their websites about this issue... and ask about English as the official language. Blitzer logic: English as the official language is a more important question than $2.5 trillion. As for McCain, on Saturday he said that no legalization could lead to Paris-style riots. If you think that through and put it in the historical context, he's a Quisling who is urging capitulation. And, no, I don't think that's too strong a statement just as long as you think through what happened and what he's suggesting. Date: Jun. 4, 2007 - 12:15 PM EST Senator McCain, we the Republicans are steaming and you keep pushing immigration. You have no chance sir, no chance of winning the nomination from this base. Every republican I speak with would not elect you. This legislation is terrible for our country and we are doing everything we can to fight it. I do repect you for your service to your country sir, but your liberal views will not serve us and if we have anything to say about it, you will not serve as our president. Date: Jun. 4, 2007 - 1:34 PM EST Mc Cain, and all of the rest of these traitors should be hung on the same Gallows as Sadam. None of them get my VOTE. Just my Hate!! Date: Jun. 4, 2007 - 1:35 PM EST I was an ardent McCain supporter in 2000 until he caved to Karl Rove's smear campaign and quit the GOP primary race. Surrender is not what war heroes do. War heroes take off the gloves and fight back. In 2004, I backed John Kerry who did the same thing, used kid gloves instead bare knuckles against a certified draft dodger and coward to boot.

Date: Jun. 4, 2007 - 5:03 PM EST McCain is playing a con game where he tries to confuse his audience with the difference between amnesty and citizenship.

Sabean, and it's time to go Better times bring worse traffic Informant helped bust alleged JFK plot By LARRY McSHANE Associated Press Writer Article Launched: 06/04/2007 12:11:33 AM PDT Click photo to enlarge Trinidadian Kareem Ibrahim, 56, left, and Guyanan Abdul Kadir arrive to the Magistrate Court for an extradition hearing in downtown Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, Monday, June 4, 2007. Ibrahim and Kadir, who are in custody of the Trinidad's authorities, are suspects in a plot to blow up a fuel line that feeds New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. NEW YORK- Four men accused of plotting to bomb a fuel pipeline feeding the city's busiest airport were so taken by an informant that they were sure God had sent him to them, authorities said. The informant made several overseas trips to discuss the plot against John F. Kennedy International Airport, even visiting a radical Muslim group's compound in Trinidad, officials said. He also joined the plotters on airport surveillance trips&mdash;where authorities were waiting, they said. The suspects were convinced he was guided by a higher purpose: The ringleader believed the informant "had been sent by Allah to be the one" to pull off the bombing, according to a federal complaint. Authorities said the plot, revealed Saturday, demonstrated the growing importance of informants in efforts to combat terrorism, particularly as smaller radical groups become more aggressive. Accused mastermind Russell Defreitas, 63, is now in custody in New York, where he was due to have a bail hearing Wednesday. But two other suspects, Kareem Ibrahim and Abdul Kadir, a former member of Guyana's Parliament, were in Trinidad and will fight extradition to the United States, their lawyer, Rajid Persad, told a Trinidadian court Monday. The two made their initial court appearance there on one count each of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act against the government of the United States. The judge set a bail hearing for June 11 and an extradition hearing Aug. 2. Authorities in Trinidad are seeking a fourth suspect, Abdel Nur. Tom Corrigan, a former member of the FBI-New York Police Department Joint Terrorism Task Force, said the Kennedy airport case and the recent plot to attack Fort Dix illustrated the need for inside information. Six men were arrested in a plot to attack soldiers at the New Jersey military base after an FBI informant infiltrated that group. "These have been two significant cases back-to-back where informants were used," Corrigan said. "These terrorists are in our own backyard. They may have to reach out to people they don't necessarily trust, but they need&mdash;for guns, explosives, whatever." Without informants, Corrigan said, investigators are often left with little more than educated guesswork. "In most cases, you can't get from A to B without an informant," the ex-NYPD detective said. In the Kennedy airport case, the informant was a twice-convicted drug dealer who found himself in the midst of what investigators called a terrorist plot conceived as more devastating than the Sept. 11 attacks. "Would you like to die as a martyr?" the informant was asked, according to the indictment. He unhesitatingly replied yes and soon was making surveillance trips around the airport&mdash;the "chicken farm," as the planners dubbed their target. Authorities said the JFK scheme was an example of homegrown terrorism. Defreitas, 63, immigrated to the U.S. more than 30 years ago, but he told the federal informant that his feelings of disgust toward his adopted homeland had lingered for years. "Before terrorism started in this country," he said in one secretly recorded conversation. Defreitas was arrested Friday night outside Brooklyn's Lindenwood Diner&mdash;a spot once bugged by federal officials tracking former Gambino family boss John A. "Junior" Gotti. The four Muslim men accused in the JFK plot didn't turn to Pakistan, Iran or Afghanistan for support after targeting the airport, home to an average of 1,000 daily flights and 45 million passengers annually. Instead, according to a federal complaint, the informant, Ibrahim and Defreitas visited a compound belonging to Jamaat al Muslimeen, a radical Islamic group known for launching a bloody 1990 coup attempt in Trinidad that involved taking the prime minister and his Cabinet hostage. It left 24 people dead. Though Jamaat al Muslimeen did have contact with the men accused in the Kennedy airport plot, it is not accused of offering them any support. The group, whose followers are largely black converts to Sunni Islam, has faded as a political force in Trinidad as its leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, fends off criminal charges of inciting violence. The rebels in the 1990 raid on Parliament surrendered and were pardoned. When Defreitas discussed his radical "brothers" with the informant, he made it clear they were not Arabs, but from Trinidad and Guyana. The complaint made clear the informant had deeply infiltrated the group. Defreitas, a retired JFK airport cargo worker, made four reconnaissance missions to the airport, authorities said. They captured each one on audio and video equipment. Ibrahim and another suspect, Abdul Kadir, were in custody in Trinidad awaiting extradition hearings. Officials identified Kadir as a former mayor of a Guyanese town and a member of the country's Parliament.

The Marine Corps wants to dismiss Kokesh, an Iraq war veteran, from the reserves for taking part in an anti-war protest and other misconduct, a move the veteran claims is punishment for his political views. (AP Photo/Kevin Wolf) WASHINGTON - The nation's largest combat veterans group on Friday urged the military to "exercise a little common sense" and call off its investigation of a group of Iraq war veterans who wore their uniforms during anti-war protests. "Trying to hush up and punish fellow Americans for exercising the same democratic right we're trying to instill in Iraq is not what we're all about," said Gary Kurpius, national commander of the 2.4 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars. "Someone in the Marine Corps needs to exercise a little common sense and put an end to this matter before it turns into a circus," Kurpius said. Marine Cpl. Adam Kokesh had already received an honorable discharge from active duty before he was photographed in March wearing fatigues , with military insignia removed , during a mock patrol with other veterans protesting the Iraq war. A military panel in Kansas City, Mo., will hold a hearing Monday to decide whether he should be should be discharged from service and, if so, with what type of discharge. Col. Dave Lapan, a Marine Corps spokesman, said Kokesh is under administrative review because he wore his uniform at a political event, which is prohibited. And, Lapan said, when a senior officer told Kokesh that he violated military regulations, Kokesh used an obscenity and indicated he would not comply with the rules. "It's the political activity that is prohibited, not the type of event that it was," Lapan said. "If it had been a pro-war rally, it would still have been a violation." The panel could recommend an honorable discharge, a general discharge or an other than honorable discharge. Kokesh could not be given a dishonorable discharge, which generally results from a court-martial. The final decision would be made by the commanding general. A second Marine who was at the same event was also called about the violation, but told the officer he was unaware he was breaking the rules and said he would not do it again, Lapan said. That Marine has not been called to an administrative hearing. Kurpius said the possibility of receiving a less than honorable discharge from service could threaten educational and other benefits Kokesh is eligible to receive from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The action might also prevent Kokesh from future employment opportunities that require a security clearance, Kurpius said. "We all know that people give up some individual rights when they join the military," Kurpius said. "But these Marines went to war, did their duty, and were honorably discharged from the active roles. I may disagree with their message, but I will always defend their right to say it." Kokesh received his honorable discharge after one combat tour in Iraq, but he remains part of the Individual Ready Reserve, a pool of former active duty service members in unpaid, non-drill status. Kokesh's attorney, Michael Lebowitz, has called the investigation an effort to stifle critics of the Bush administration's Iraq policy. Associated Press Writer Lolita C.

Fill out this form to email this article to a friend Rice: U.S. not preparing for war against Iran Published June 2, 2007 MADRID - The United States is not preparing for war against Iran, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday, taking a swipe at a U.N. official who says he&#39;s worried about "crazies" who want to start bombing. "The president has made clear that we are on a diplomatic course, " she said in regard to U.S. opposition to Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions. Rice, in Spain at the close of a European visit, was asked about the comments by the chief of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency. Mohamed ElBaradei was quoted by the BBC as warning against the views of "new crazies who say, &#39;Let&#39;s go and bomb Iran.&#39; " Rice was clearly annoyed by ElBaradei&#39;s remarks, which were part of an interview the International Atomic Energy Agency head gave for a documentary. Rice also insisted that Vice President Dick Cheney backs the diplomatic course. Cheney is frequently the administration&#39;s most hawkish voice on Iran Cheney has not publicly advocated an assault on Iran, but - while standing on the deck of an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf - he warned Tehran last month that Washington would prevent the Islamic republic from dominating the Middle East. The United States does not rule out military action but says there is no plan to attack Tehran.

"What the Marine Corps is trying to do is hush up and punish these individuals who served our country," Gary Kurpius, the national commander, said in a telephone interview. "All they're doing is exercising the same democratic voice we're trying to instill over in Iraq right now." Attorney Michael Lebowitz, left, Adam Kokesh, Garrett Reppenhagen, attorney Kevin Zeiss and Liam Madden at a news conference in Washington yesterday. (By Lawrence Jackson -- Associated Press) | 'Operation First Casualty' Save & Share Article The Marines have accused the three reservists, all members of Iraq Veterans Against the War, of wearing their uniforms during political protests and making "disrespectful" or "disloyal" statements. All three were honorably discharged from active duty, but now face "other than honorable" discharges from the inactive reserve, which could affect future employment and veterans benefits. The VFW issued a blistering statement on the controversy yesterday. Headline: "VFW to Corps: Don't Stifle Freedom of Speech." Kurpius, an Army vet who fought in Vietnam, doesn't even agree with the protesters. "We're pretty much on record supporting the troops, and if you're going to support the troops, you're going to have to support their mission," he said. "I may disagree with the message . . . but I and my organization will always defend their right to say it." The Marines respond that this is not a free-speech case. Adam Kokesh, 25, one of the protesters, "violated Marine Corps uniform regulations and he was disrespectful to a commissioned officer," said Master Sgt. Ronald Spencer, a spokesman for the Marine Corps Mobilization Command in Kansas City, Mo. "That would be the issue. It has nothing to do with free speech." Kokesh, who fought in Fallujah and now is a graduate student at George Washington University, was wearing parts of his camouflage uniform in March where 13 veterans roamed Capitol Hill and downtown Washington carrying imaginary weapons to mark the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq. When Kokesh was contacted by the major assigned to investigate the case, he responded with an e-mail about his service and opposition to the war, and concluded with a profane suggestion about what the major could go do. While all three reservists wore parts of their uniforms during demonstrations, at least one of the charges seems to involve speech only: Liam Madden, 22, of Boston, is accused of making disloyal statements in a speech where he accused the Bush administration of "war crimes"; said the conflict is a war "of aggression" and "empire building"; and said Bush "betrayed U.S. military personnel." Madden says he was not in uniform during that February speech in New York. Spencer, after addressing the uniform issue, said he needed a few hours to research questions about the alleged disloyal statements, then did not return messages to answer those questions. Maj. Stewart Upton, a Pentagon spokesman, referred those questions back to Spencer, saying, "I'm unable to speak to the legal reasoning behind the freedom of speech charges issued by the Marine Corps." Kokesh's lawyer, Michael Lebowitz, an Iraq Army vet with the Washington firm of Greenberg & Lieberman, says what's at stake is the very definition of a civilian. These reservists are among the 158,000 on the Individual Ready Reserve, a pool of discharged former active-duty soldiers and Marines who aren't paid, don't drill, have no chain of command, yet may be recalled to duty during the few years they are on inactive reserve. Lebowitz says they have the free-speech rights of civilians; the Marines disagree. "Someone in the Marine Corps needs to exercise a little common sense and put an end to this matter before it turns into a circus," said the VFW's Kurpius. The circus may already have arrived, in a white touring bus. Yesterday evening, Kokesh, 25, held a news conference at Union Station. Then he and his supporters boarded what they call the Yellow Rose of Texas Bus for Peace, festooned with flags and antiwar slogans for a road trip to Kansas City, where Kokesh faces a discharge hearing Monday. In the crowd was Tina Richards, an antiwar activist who is the mother of Cloy Richards, 23, who served two tours in Iraq -- and who was also investigated for wearing his uniform during protests. The young man is 80 percent disabled and can't afford to risk the $1,300 a month he receives in veteran's benefits. He has been told he could lose them if he receives an other-than-honorable discharge, according to his mother. "It's a form of intimidation and blackmail on the military's part to quiet the combat veterans who are speaking out against the war," said Tina Richards, who wears parts of her son's uniform to protest on his behalf. Kurpius noted the example of retired generals -- including at least one Marine -- criticizing the war effort, even though retired top officers retain certain obligations to the military. "I see them on CNN all the time, badmouthing the administration," Kurpius said. "Why is something not done about those individuals, when these poor troops are being hammered?"

Thompson Debut Admission of Defeat? Saturday, June 02, 2007 - FreeMarketNews.com Fred Thompsons probable entry into the GOP presidential race is not just the introduction of another candidate into a crowded field, but may be seen as a desperate move by Republican leaders to offer what they consider a viable contender. As an FMNN commentator pointed out yesterday: Thompsons candidacy is a virtual admission that the current slate of candidates including Rudy Giuliani and John McCain is failing miserably. Theres seemingly a lot of pressure on Thompson to pry him loose from a comfortable Hollywood career. Today, the New York Times reports, in an article by Craig Crawford: Facing a flawed field of 10 aspirants, whose top tier seems way out of ideological sync with the partys core conservatives, many veteran Republicans are now looking to Candidate No. 11 as their possible savior in what promises to be a difficult quest to retain the White House next year. Yet Ron Paul (R-Tex), congressman and republican candidate for president has been seen by Internet observers as doing well both in debates and in terms of public sentiment. His message is one of minimalist government, low taxes and a non-aggressive military policy. Meanwhile, despite the coverage, Fred Thompson is likely not the next coming of Ronald Reagan for the Republican party. An FMNN article yesterday, Fred Thompson Vs. Ron Paul, pointed out that "Thompsons record gives rise to questions about his small government and &#39;federalist&#39; credentials.  While in congress, Thompson, reportedly a good friend of Senator John McCain, (R-AZ), supported two obviously anti-free market bills: the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform act and the Shays-Meehan bill restricting issue ads. He is also a member of Council on Foreign Relations, a main think-tank behind the idea of a North American Union that would eventually dissolve borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States to create one big super-nation. Thompson also seems to believe in a robust military presence worldwide and apparently advocates continued US military involvement in Iraq. In a pre-Internet era, party leaders could suggest candidates such as Fred Thompson and be reasonably certain that their campaign rhetoric would define them sufficiently for voters. But with the Internet, a candidates background is available as are his positions going back in time. Fred Thompsons positions are not much different than those of candidates running now for the GOP presidential ticket. Ron Pauls classical liberal and small r republican positions are meeting with success and will likely continue to gain him support as he exposes more voters to them.

"Just as we have to be vigilant to protect our national security -- something I believe in passionately -- we have to be vigilant to protect our freedom of speech and First Amendment rights," Valerie Plame Wilson said in a speech at a book convention. Plame and her publisher, Simon & Schuster, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York on Thursday against top CIA officials for blocking publication of her memoir on national security grounds. Plame's cover as a CIA agent was blown when her identity was leaked to reporters and appeared in a newspaper column in July 2003, shortly after her husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, emerged as an Iraq war critic. Plame said she had no intention of endangering national security with the book but was entitled to tell her story. "This has nothing to do with national security and everything to do with political influence and manipulation," Plame said of the CIA's demand that she not discuss her service before 2002. The CIA has argued her book could hurt operations and affect its ability to conduct intelligence activities in the future. "I'm not seeking carte blanche to reveal all the details of my government service," Plame said. The book, "Fair Game," is set to be published on Oct. 21. The leaking of Plame's identity prompted an investigation to determine if government officials had broken any laws. Nobody was charged with blowing her cover, but Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Cheney's former chief of staff, was found guilty in March of lying and obstructing the investigation. He is due to be sentenced on Tuesday and faces up to three years in prison. Evidence at Libby's trial showed he and several other White House and State Department officials leaked her identity to discredit her husband, who had accused the administration of twisting intelligence to build a case for invading Iraq. Plame has since filed a lawsuit against Cheney and other top administration officials, seeking money damages for violating the couple's constitutional free speech, due process and privacy rights. She said initially she was reluctant to sue, but did so for three reasons. "The first one is to get the truth," she told the audience of publishers and booksellers in New York who gave her a standing ovation even before she spoke. "Secondly, to hold our government officials to account for their words and their deeds ... Finally it's to prevent future abuses." "We are living in very troubled times and it's imperative that we all understand what our rights are and understand when we are being trampled on," she said later, answering a question from the audience. Plame said she expected a judge to rule by the end of the summer on a motion by Cheney to dismiss the suit. All publications by current and former CIA agents must be approved by a review board, which says its only objective is to prevent classified material from being released to the public.

Salem-News.com is the Publisher of Frontline-News Democrats Slug it Out During Second Televised Debate Polls continue to indicate that a Democrat will probably be elected President in the next election. Former North Carolina senator John Edwards (L), New York Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (C), and Illinois Senator Barack Obama (R) from the Democratic debate (WMUR-TV/New Hampshire) - One thing is certain in the wake of a debate between Democratic Presidential candidates today; President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy will soon cease to exist if the Republicans lose control of the oval office in 2008. Polls continue to indicate that a Democrat will most likely take the helm in the next election. Eight Democratic Presidential candidates took to the podiums today in an event put together by CNN, WMUR-TV and the New Hampshire Union Leader, to debate a number of topics that may ultimately influence voters on election day. The actual television broadcast was not a reflection of what we generally expect in national TV. They had audio problems and Wolf Blitzer had to repeat questions from the panel that the candidates could not understand. The camera work probably made a few people run for their Dramamine and I had to wonder why so little went into the event in terms of pre-production and planning. I will say that every time I have covered a presidential visit I always end up on a big platform that bounces if somebody breathes wrong. Still, this seemed like the bar was somehow lowered. During the debate the candidates agreed on some things and in some areas they displayed almost bitter opposition. Most Democrats hold the Bush Administration more or less accountable for most of the huge events of the last six years, but Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich says President George W. Bush should not just be blamed for the war in Iraq, but on the Congress that authorized it. Kucinich says U.S. troops "never should have been sent there in the first place," he said. He says the time is now, Americans in Iraq are increasingly becoming targets in a civil war, and it is time to call it, "just say no money, the war's over." Joe Biden says the time to end the war in Iraq is now, but he defended the recent actions of Democrats who in the end, agreed to fund the conflict in Iraq. But Biden says that is not about blame, it is about making sure people over there are safe and have what they need. Perhaps the most revolutionary thinker of the eight is indeed Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who I had the chance to interview during John Kerry's campaign for President. While they all talked about improving the American healthcare system, acknowledging that it is badly in need of a major overhaul, Kucinich is the only one out of the eight who talks about bringing medical care to Americans through a program that would basically end the reign of American insurance companies and their ever escalating costs. He wants American healthcare to stop being a profit industry. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson says he brought healthcare to all kids under five. Other candidates like Barack Obama said that is not enough. Hillary Clinton talked about President Bill Clinton's unsuccessful efforts to establish a national healthcare system, "And I have the scars to prove it," she added. As strong contenders, plans under development by Clinton, Edwards and Obama all utilize the existing system. While many of the questions fielded by CNN's Wolf Blitzer and other journalists seemed logical and important, other questions were called out onto the carpet, so to speak, for being among the unnecessary subjects that typically divide Americans, ones there are no easy or practical answers for. One such question was whether or not English should be the "official U.S. language." Barack Obama objected to the notion of that being a subject that could lead to positive, saying it was, "the kind of question that was designed precisely to divide us." The senator said questions like that, "do a disservice to the American people." Obama was gracious during another hot button subject that he easily could have taken more advantage of; that is the initial support of the invasion of Iraq. While he wasn't in Congress at the time, he was the only one of the eight who openly refused to put his political support behind the initial war effort. To this day, Hillary Clinton seems very reluctant to admit that she may have made a mistake in following along with the intelligence reports on Weapons of Mass Destruction. Part of the problem is that both Clinton and former North Carolina Senator John Edwards chose to back President Bush and his team at the time, but neither took the time to fully read the fine print when it came to the intelligence reports. When asked if they regret not having fully read the intelligence reports at the time, each said no, citing reason after reason that the information they received at the time was sufficient to base a solid decision. But Edwards went a step further, saying in regard to that decision, "I was wrong." That is something Hillary is yet to do. Another change that seems guaranteed by putting a Democrat in office, will be the end of the military's "Don't Ask- Don't Tell" policy that was implemented during the Clinton Administration. Each of the candidates said it would be history. Richardson went a step further, "I would include domestic partnerships in the military." He decried the nine thousand servicemembers who have been discharged over their homosexuality while soldiers embattled in Iraq are running short on people. He also talked about how America's allies like France and Great Britain allow open homosexuality. "I have a feeling that soldiers in Iraq don't look at the Brit that is backing them up in combat and say, 'Are you gay?'" Richardson also talked about vast improvements that need to take place in the Veteran's Administration healthcare system. Former Senator Mike Gravel, D-Alaska was the only candidate who voiced confidence in the current VA healthcare system, he was also quick to talk about how the English language needs to be the country's official language. An ABC poll released June 1st shows Hillary Clinton leading the Democrats prior to the debate with 35% of the people surveyed saying they would back her for President. Barack Obama trails Clinton with 21%. 11% of those surveyed back Edwards, with Richardson at 2% and Biden at 1%. Rudy Giuliani is leading the race in the same poll as of June 1st, with 32% of those surveyed supporting his run for the oval office. Senator John McCain' 19% leads newcomer Fred Thompson who is already pulling support from 11% of the people surveyed. Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich both are pulling 9% and Mike Huckabee has 2%. More contenders after that for the Republican ticket all pulling 1% are Tom Tancredo, Tommy Thompson, Duncan Hunter, Sam Brownback and two others. Indeed, the nation is in for a big change and whoever takes the reigns of this great nation is going to have a big job on their hands, to say the least.

Fred Thompson talks an interview with the Associated Press in Richmond, Va., Saturday, June 2, 2007. In one breath, Thompson insists he has not yet decided whether to run for president. In the next, he sounds like a man on the cusp of a full-fledged White House bid. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) RICHMOND, Va. - Fred Thompson says the country faces different challenges now than it did when he spurned overtures to run for president in 2000, leading him to consider a return to politics. "I think that everybody was kind of sitting back, taking it easy and thinking that, you know, peace and prosperity were going to kind of last forever. I think we know better than that now," the former Tennessee senator told The Associated Press. "We live in a more dangerous (time of) things that threaten our very existence, things that threaten our peace, things that threaten our economic stability." In an interview Saturday night before speaking to the Virginia GOP, Thompson would not talk in detail about why he believes he might make a good president or what his priorities would be. "I'd do lots of things," he said, declining to elaborate. During his 1994-2002 Senate tenure, he was considered a reliably conservative vote. But he had few significant legislative achievements and established a reputation as a less-than-hard worker. "That's one rap that you can cure," Thompson said. When pressed, he struggled to name his greatest accomplishment in the Senate. He said he managed the homeland security bill in the full Senate and added: "There were a lot of things. ... It doesn't always have to do with putting your name on a piece of legislation. There was an awful lot of bad legislation that I helped to stop for one thing." But, he said with a smile, "We'll have a chance to get into all that when I start telling everybody what a wonderful person I am. But we're not quite at that stage." At least not yet. After flirting with a candidacy for months, the former senator and actor known to millions as the tough prosecutor on NBC's "Law & Order" took the first formal step toward the race for the GOP nomination Friday in establishing a preliminary campaign committee. Thompson, however, said he still was not ready to commit to a 2008 campaign. "We've not made a final decision on it. But obviously we're thinking pretty seriously about it," he said. "Everybody who has an opportunity to make even a small difference in the course of the direction of the country has got to look at that very seriously." Among his considerations, he said, was making sure "the man fits the times." Despite his coyness, Thompson is all but certain to join the crowded GOP field led by Rudy Giuliani, John McCain and Mitt Romney. Thompson's entrance could come as early as July. Fundraising was expected to begin in earnest Monday. Headquarters are planned for Nashville, Tenn., and the Washington, D.C., area. A campaign team is forming. Tentative visits to Iowa, New Hampshire and other early primary states are in the works. A Washington Post poll published Sunday found that Giuliani remained the front-runner, but suggested his popularity could be showing signs of stalling because of his support for abortion rights and gay rights. Thompson's candidacy could quickly turn the contest into a four-way battle, according to the poll. Thompson, 64, said much has changed since he rejected calls to run for president in 2000. Encouraged by an effort to draft him into the 2008 race, Thompson said he now finds the prospect appealing for several reasons. "I am married now, have two children at home. I spend a lot of time thinking about the kind of world that they're going to grow up in, spend a lot of time talking to my wife about that," he said. "And I think the country's different. I think we have challenges now that we didn't have in 2000." He said that in the years since he left public office and focused on his acting career, he has maintained his interest in what is going on in the world. "It's ultimately up to the American people what they think about me," Thompson said. "I've never desired to hold the office, particularly. In fact, not at all. But, at this stage of things, I sometimes think that I do desire the opportunity to do some things that only a president can do." He said his ambivalence until now about the presidency ultimately might make him a better leader and, thus, a better fit for the White House than others. "If a person craves power for the sake of power, if he craves the office for the sake of holding the office, he's got his priorities mixed up," Thompson said. "It's a desire to do something not to be something." The Southerner with Hollywood star power and mostly conservative Senate credentials fares well in national popularity polls. But he would enter the race some six months after the top-tier trio. He trails them significantly in money and organization, raising questions about whether he can turn buzz on the Internet and in Washington into actual votes when the primaries begin in less than eight months. Undaunted, he belittled the notion that candidates can only be competitive if they have had a campaign organization in place for months and if they raise upward of $100 million this year. "I don't know who made those rules. I don't know who the experts are. I'm too late to follow those rules even if I wanted to, and I don't want to," Thompson said. "At the end of the day, the people have to be receptive to you and your message. It doesn't matter how many campaign advisers you've got or how much money you can spend. If it's meant to be, it'll be."

Rik Jesse, FLORIDA TODAY Local forecast from National Weather Service For daily weather updates Tropical Storm Barry, which dumped record June rainfall on Brevard County, has put a significant damper on the area's long-standing brush fire threat, weather forecasters said Saturday. Barry, the first named storm since hurricane season officially began Friday, brought almost the same amount of rain as the area has seen since Jan. 1. Through May, the National Weather Service in Melbourne recorded 7.10 inches of precipitation, just more than half of the 13.91 inches that the area typically sees through that span. Clouds are expected to linger today as the storm system pulls away from the area, said Matt Bragaw, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Melbourne. Temperatures will be in the upper 80s to low 90s with lows in the upper 60s to low 70s. There's a 20 percent or less chance of rain despite the partly cloudy forecast for the rest of the weekend, he said. Barry, which was downgraded early Saturday afternoon to a tropical depression, soaked Brevard with 6.03 inches of rain, with 5.28 inches of that coming between midnight and noon. That was a record amount locally not only for the date, but also for any day in June. The rain topped the average rainfall for June of 5.83 inches and brings Brevard almost up to the normal rainfall average for this time of year. While the rain was a welcomed sight, the downpour and wind gusts of 30 to 35 mph wrought minor trouble in some areas. A section of Eau Gallie Boulevard caved in, closing the road just west of Pineapple Avenue for much of Saturday. Melbourne police found the 6- to 7-foot in diameter crater just after 8 a.m. Minor street flooding also was reported on Merritt Island and in Palm Bay, Melbourne and Rockledge. The damage on Eau Gallie may have been caused by a crack in a storm water drainage pipe that runs beneath the street, said Scott Price, a supervisor with the Florida Department of Transportation. Because of the water flow, a crack would have created a suction that drew dirt into the pipe, contributing to the collapse. FDOT has plans to insert a camera into the pipe to confirm whether there is a crack, Price said. Brevard is not necessarily through with its drought, which has stretched back through last year. With the exception of November, Melbourne has seen below-normal rainfall every month since August. "It will help some, but I would be hesitant to say the drought is over," Bragaw said. However, Barry did significantly cut the wildfire threat in Brevard. "When you get rainfall at this magnitude it certainly helps put a damper on it, literally," Bragaw said. The Keetch-Byram Drought Index, a key indicator of wildfire threat, plummeted 358 points in Brevard. Friday, the county's drought index was a mean of 660 with ranges between 579 and 712. Saturday the index ranged from 1 and 531 with a mean of 301. The index ranges from 0 to 800 with drought conditions heightened as the numbers increase. Suntree resident Brad Magill was glad to see the rain, even if it did mean he had to drain about four inches of water out of his pool. The 52-year-old said he woke several times during the night to hear the pounding of the rain against his roof. "I said, 'It looks like we're getting the rain we need,' " Magill said. "I'd like to see two more storms like that in the next month." Contact Cervenka at 360-1018 or Be the first to comment on this story Copyright &copy; , Florida Today. All rights reserved.

Monday, 4th June 2007 Sat 2 Jun 2007 Former CIA employee Valerie Plame Wilson testifies at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington March 16, 2007. An ex-spy whose unmasking led to the conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney's top aide vowed on Saturday to press on with lawsuits against Cheney and the CIA for the sake of freedom of speech. REUTERS/Larry Downing U.S. ex-spy Plame vows to battle CIA over free speech NEW YORK (Reuters) - An ex-spy whose unmasking led to the conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney's top aide vowed on Saturday to press on with lawsuits against Cheney and the CIA for the sake of freedom of speech. "Just as we have to be vigilant to protect our national security -- something I believe in passionately -- we have to be vigilant to protect our freedom of speech and First Amendment rights," Valerie Plame Wilson said in a speech at a book convention. Plame and her publisher, Simon & Schuster, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York on Thursday against top CIA officials for blocking publication of her memoir on national security grounds. Plame's cover as a CIA agent was blown when her identity was leaked to reporters and appeared in a newspaper column in July 2003, shortly after her husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, emerged as an Iraq war critic. Plame said she had no intention of endangering national security with the book but was entitled to tell her story. "This has nothing to do with national security and everything to do with political influence and manipulation," Plame said of the CIA's demand that she not discuss her service before 2002. The CIA has argued her book could hurt operations and affect its ability to conduct intelligence activities in the future. "I'm not seeking carte blanche to reveal all the details of my government service," Plame said. The book, "Fair Game," is set to be published on October 21. The leaking of Plame's identity prompted an investigation to determine if government officials had broken any laws. Nobody was charged with blowing her cover, but Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Cheney's former chief of staff, was found guilty in March of lying and obstructing the investigation. He is due to be sentenced on Tuesday and faces up to three years in prison. Evidence at Libby's trial showed he and several other White House and State Department officials leaked her identity to discredit her husband, who had accused the administration of twisting intelligence to build a case for invading Iraq. Plame has since filed a lawsuit against Cheney and other top administration officials, seeking money damages for violating the couple's constitutional free speech, due process and privacy rights. She said initially she was reluctant to sue, but did so for three reasons. "The first one is to get the truth," she told the audience of publishers and booksellers in New York who gave her a standing ovation even before she spoke. "Secondly, to hold our government officials to account for their words and their deeds ... Finally it's to prevent future abuses." "We are living in very troubled times and it's imperative that we all understand what our rights are and understand when we are being trampled on," she said later, answering a question from the audience. Plame said she expected a judge to rule by the end of the summer on a motion by Cheney to dismiss the suit. All publications by current and former CIA agents must be approved by a review board, which says its only objective is to prevent classified material from being released to the public.

Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Monday, Jun 4, 2007 Posted on Sat, Jun. 02, 2007 Kevorkian is released after 8 years in prison He said he felt "wonderful." His lawyer said he would speak Tuesday. By Kathy Barks Hoffman Carlos Osorio / Associated Press. pool Assisted-suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian receives a hug from "60 Minutes" correspondent Mike Wallace at the Lakeland Correctional Facility in Coldwater, Mich. "What do you say, young man?" Wallace, who is 89, asked Kevorkian, 79. COLDWATER, Mich. - Jack Kevorkian had few words but a broad smile as he walked out of prison yesterday, ending eight years behind bars for helping end the life of a man suffering from Lou Gehrig&#0039;s disease. The retired pathologist known as "Dr. Death" said his release felt "wonderful - one of the high points in life" as he paused near a van that was waiting to drive him to the home of friends in a Detroit suburb. Outside a gift shop across from the 25-acre prison grounds, about a dozen people stood in a show of support. The group held signs bearing such phrases as "Jack, we&#0039;re glad you&#0039;re out of the box" and "Dr. K is on his way!" The attention focused on a man who claimed participation in at least 130 assisted suicides brought a rebuke from the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. "For 10 years, Jack Kevorkian&#0039;s actions resembled those of a pathological serial killer," archdiocese spokesman Ned McGrath said in a statement. "It will be truly regrettable if he&#0039;s now treated as a celebrity parolee instead of the convicted murderer he is." Kevorkian, 79, wearing his trademark blue cardigan and a striped shirt and tie, spoke only a few words to reporters after leaving the prison with his lawyers and legal assistants. As he got ready for the ride home, correspondent Mike Wallace, 89, got out of the van and embraced him, asking: "What do you say, young man?" Inmates at the Lakeland Correctional Facility, about 100 miles southwest of Detroit, had been waiting for a glimpse of Kevorkian, while reporters greeted him on the outside with questions. Attorney Mayer Morganroth said his client planned a news conference Tuesday. "He thanks everybody for coming," Morganroth said. "He thanks the thousands who have supported him, have written to him. He just wants a little privacy for the next few days." Throughout the 1990s, Kevorkian challenged authorities to make his actions legal - or try to stop him. He burned state orders against him and showed up at court in costume. "You think I&#0039;m going to obey the law? You&#0039;re crazy," he said in 1998 shortly before he was accused - and then convicted - of murder after injecting lethal drugs into Thomas Youk, 52, a Detroit-area man suffering from Lou Gehrig&#0039;s disease. Kevorkian videotaped that death and sent the footage to , which aired it. He challenged prosecutors to charge him. He was convicted and given a 10-to-25-year sentence for second-degree murder. He earned time off his sentence for good behavior. Kevorkian is expected to move to Bloomfield Hills, just outside Detroit, where he will live with friends and resume the artistic and musical hobbies he missed while in prison. His lawyer and friends have said he plans to live on a small pension and Social Security while doing some writing and making some speeches.

WASHINGTON -- The nation's largest combat veterans group urged the military Friday to "exercise a little common sense" and call off its investigation of a group of Iraq war veterans who wore their uniforms during anti-war protests. "Trying to hush up and punish fellow Americans for exercising the same Democratic right we're trying to instill in Iraq is not what we're all about," said Gary Kurpius, national commander of the 2.4 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars. "Someone in the Marine Corps needs to exercise a little common sense and put an end to this matter before it turns into a circus," Kurpius said. A military panel in Kansas City, Mo., is holding a hearing Monday to decide whether Marine Cpl. Adam Kokesh's discharge status should be changed from honorable to "other than honorable" after he was photographed wearing fatigues -- with military insignia removed -- during a mock patrol with other veterans at a protest rally in April in Washington D.C. The Marine Corps is investigating whether Kokesh might have violated a rule prohibiting troops from wearing uniforms without authorization. Kokesh, 25,was honorably discharged after a combat tour in Iraq, but he remains part of the Individual Ready Reserve, a pool of former active-duty service members in unpaid, non-drill status. Kokesh was also cited for making a disrespectful comment to a military officer investigating the incident. His attorney, Michael Lebowitz, has called the case an effort to stifle critics of the Bush administration's Iraq policy. Kurpius said that even an implied threat to lower the discharge rating could threaten educational and other benefits that he is eligible to receive from the Veterans Affairs Department. The action might also prevent Kokesh, a graduate student at George Washington University, from holding jobs that require a security clearance, Kurpius said. Also under investigation is Liam Madden, 22, who spent seven months on the ground in Iraq. Last fall he helped launch the Appeal for Redress, a Web site where military personnel can directly appeal to Congress to support withdrawal of troops. Madden, of Boston, is accused of wearing his camouflage shirt at an anti-war march in Washington in January. He is also accused of making disloyal statements during a speech in February in New York, when he says he wasn't wearing his uniform. The identity of the third Marine under investigation could not be immediately verified. "We all know that people give up some individual rights when they join the military," Kurpius said. "But these Marines went to war, did their duty, and were honorably discharged from the active roles. I may disagree with their message, but I will always defend their right to say it."

Kennedy International Airport in New York City. &#40;AP&#41; Officials in Guyana and Trinidad continue their search for the fourth suspect in the JFK airport terror plot uncovered Friday. The suspect, Abdel Nur, from Guyana, reportedly left his home three weeks ago and headed for Trinidad and Tobago, where two other suspects are being held pending extradition. U.S. on Trail of 4th Alleged JFK Plotter Feds Battle Homegrown Terror Threat Giuliani: 'Terrorists Are at War with Us' Feds Bust Alleged N.Y. Airport Terror Plot FBI Feared JFK Plotters Linked to Top Terrorist Federal officials say the plot to blow up fuel lines at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York was stopped long before the alleged terrorists were anywhere near being able to carry it out. That's partly because investigators say they had an informant inside the group. ABC News terrorism analyst Jack Cloonan says that is incredibly important. "It is the human element to it all," Cloonan says. "It is a good informant who can preempt and tell you everything that you have to know about this particular case." That informant, a twice convicted drug dealer, was just part of a far-reaching effort by New York City police and the FBI to prepare against the threat of home-grown terrorism -- to combat angry Americans, inspired to attack their own country. "It's a movement. It's a philosophy, " says New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. "And they're motivated by the same hatred that motivates al Qaeda." The alleged terrorists in the Kennedy Airport plot had no known ties to al Qaeda and one is an American citizen. So is one of the suspects behind the alleged plot against Fort Dix in New Jersey. The FBI says this type of terrorist can be more difficult to track. So law enforcement officials are leaving no stone unturned when it comes to homegrown extremists, John Miller, the FBI's assistant director of public affairs, told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on "This Week" Sunday -- a day after officials charged four men in the JFK plot. "When you're looking at inspired-through-the-Internet, homegrown extremists, well, they can pop up anywhere," Miller said. "So now, instead of having a focus in a certain direction, you have to focus in a 360-degree radius every moment of every day." That's just what law enforcement has been doing. ABC News has learned that for three years, New York City police have been going door-to-door in Muslim neighborhoods, introducing themselves to shopkeepers, community leaders, and imams -- 30,000 visits -- trying to overcome the suspicion many in ethnic neighborhoods feel toward the police.

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice criticized the decision by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to pull the plug on RCTV last month. "We called on the Venezuelan government to reverse course and reopen the independent TV station there and cease these attacks on the free press," said Rice from the Spanish capital, where she was meeting her Spanish counterpart. The leftist Chavez decided not to renew RCTV's license to broadcast, saying the station's programming was promoting unrest. Want to use this article? Click here for options!

Democratic Congressman William Jefferson of Louisiana (2006 file photo) Democratic Representative William Jefferson was charged Monday with soliciting bribes, racketeering and money-laundering in relation to a long-running investigation into business deals he tried to broker in Africa. Jefferson has maintained his innocence, and was reelected last year despite the allegations against him. The Louisiana lawmaker is accused of using his position to promote the sale of telecommunications equipment and services from a Lousiana-based firm to Nigeria, Ghana and other African nations. Two years ago, officials said they found $90,000 in bribe money in a freezer at his home. Last year, former Democratic congressional aide Brett Pfeffer pleaded guilty to helping Jefferson solicit bribes. He was sentenced to eight years in prison.

In Greensboro, like the nation as a whole, violent crime increased 6 percent. The increase was due almost exclusively to reported robberies. FBI data shows the number of local murders remained unchanged. Winston-Salem saw a jump in murders, rapes and robberies. Its number of aggravated assaults declined from 2005 to 2006. The nation's murder rate rose slightly last year but the number of robberies skyrocketed by 6 percent. The statistics were part of an overall 1.3 percent rise in violent crime across the country in 2006 &mdash; the second straight annual increase. However, car thefts, arsons and other property crimes dipped nationally for the second straight year, the data show. The modest increase in murders reflected a mixed bag for cities. The number of homicides in major metropolitan areas &mdash; those with at least 1 million residents &mdash; climbed by 6.7 percent. Smaller cities, meanwhile, saw their murders decrease by a collective 11.9 percent. The spike in robberies marked the highest increase in any category of crime surveyed in the FBI report, which was compiled with data from more than 11,700 law enforcement agencies nationwide. Only the nation's largest cities, including Greensboro and Winston-Salem, had individual statistics released Monday. Statistics for High Point were not published. Nor was the data from local sheriff's offices. A comprehensive report with detailed information from all cities and counties is scheduled for publication in September. Violent crime rose in every region of the country except for the Northeast, the FBI reported. Western states saw the largest jump in violent crime, by 2.8 percent, the data show. The new numbers come amid a Justice Department push to tamp down violent crime with millions of new dollars in funds to local police and a surge of federal agents to troubled cities. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales &mdash; who took office as violent crime started to rise &mdash; has called the crackdown one of his top priorities for the remaining 18 months of his tenure at the Justice Department. In a spot of good news, violent crime grew at a slower pace than initially expected. In December, the FBI projected a 3.7 percent increase for the first six months of 2006. The year before, in 2005, violent crime rose by 2.3 percent. Property crimes decreased overall by 2.9 percent from 2005, the FBI reported. Burglaries, however, rose slightly &mdash; particularly in mid-sized cities, where the rate grew by 3.3 percent.

The immigration proposal plays a little differently in Florida, a major early state with a large Cuba-American population. The former governor, Jeb Bush, is supporting it (as is his brother George, the president). So the chose the Miami area to mount their most complete defense to date against the many vocal Republicans now opposing the measure. Here are some more excerpts from the speech: âThe politics of Washington have encouraged us to leave solutions to the toughest problems for another unluckier generation of leaders. Problems are left unsolved year after year, because we fear the political consequences of seriously addressing them or value their utility as political attacks in our campaigns. â¦ âTo do nothing now would be an unconscionable abrogation of our responsibilities to defend the security, prosperity and values of our country.â âI welcome any attempt to meet our responsibility to fix our broken borders and immigration system. Our proposal has provoked criticism from some on both the left and right. Compromises usually do. People of good will, who take their responsibilities seriously, argue variously that our ideas are too tough or not tough enough. I do not question the sincerity of their convictions or their purpose in proposing other ways to address the problem. There is one premise most of us agree on: the status quo is unacceptable. âOur borders are unsecured, our laws are being violated, and our current immigration laws do not meet the needs of a growing economy. And while we are argue over the means to solve a problem, we should respect each otherâs intentions.â âThe most difficult problem is what to do about the twelve million or more undocumented workers who live and work here now. No critic of our bill has offered a serious proposal to round up all these millions, many of whom have children born in this country, and ship them back to their countries of origin. There is simply no practical way to do that, and most Americans understand that.â âThose undocumented workers who declare themselves, pass criminal background checks, prove their employment, pay fines, taxes, learn English and study American civics may be offered eventually, and I stress eventually, a path to citizenship. Critics of the bill attack this as amnesty and a special path to citizenship that is denied to lawful immigrants. Both charges are false. â¦ âIllegal immigrants broke our laws and they should pay a penalty for doing so. We impose fines, fees and other requirements as punishment. And if the path to citizenship we offer them is âspecial,â it is because it is harder, longer and more expensive than the path offered to those immigrants who come here legally.â âIt is a hard problem, and I understand that. But the choice is between doing something, imperfect but effective and achievable, and doing nothing. I would hope that any candidate for President would not suggest doing nothing. And I would hope they wouldnât play politics for their own interests if the cost of their ambition was to make this problem even harder to solve. To want the office so badly that you would intentionally make our countryâs problems worse might prove you can read a poll or take a cheap shot, but it hardly demonstrates presidential leadership. â¦ âWe have a chance now to secure our borders and place effective controls on immigration that benefit all of us, and enhance our ability to apprehend terrorists before they strike us. It is a common sense, conservative approach to the problem. Is any office worth sacrificing the progress we can make now to solve this crisis? â¦ âI make one pledge to you that I will keep no matter what. I will never conduct my campaign in such a way that it makes our countryâs most difficult challenges harder to solve. I hope you will hold all candidates to that same standard. Pandering for votes on this issue, while offering no solution to the problem, amounts to doing nothing. And doing nothing is silent amnesty.â âWe canât leave our borders so undefended that people who come here to hurt us can enter it as easily as someone following a dream of living in a great country. But these people are also Godâs children, who wanted simply to be Americans, and we cannot forget the humanity God commands of us as we seek a remedy to this problem. â¦ âWe have a chance this year to prevent such terrible tragedies from occurring in the numbers they have occurred in the past. Letâs do it. For the sake of security, justice, prosperity and humanity, let us do it. â 29 comments so far... Yeah sure, God commands that we and our livestock become the only species of animal life on the whole planet too, according to the seers of divine intentions. â Posted by Steve Bolger The problem that even reasonable people have with the current bill is that they know that the government has neither the will nor capacity to implement it or enforce it. The border cannot be sealed. &#8220;Guest workers&#8221; will not go home after two years and we will not find them. One third of the twelve million illegals will not sign up and will stay underground and we will not find them. We will not charge those businesses that defy this bill. Why should we expect this bill to be enforced any better than the last one? â Posted by c. perry There is a lot to mull over in Sen. McCain&#8217;s speech. There are both trenchant observations and election banalities. But it all boils down to one key sentence: &#8220;The choice is between doing something, imperfect but effective and achievable, and doing nothing.&#8221; There is not much doubt that the Immigration Bill is imperfect. One only has to look at the various criticisms ennunciated by the public as well as specialized groups to wonder how well the Bill addresses all the conflicting issues that immigration represents. And the Bill does look increasingly like it may well be achieveable if current news reports are accurate. It certainly has been able to bridge the congressional divide to gain impressive bi-partisan support. But the key word upon which the whole complicated three hundred page Bill really pivots is &#8220;effective&#8221;. Does the Bill actually provide the means and dollars and tools to secure the border, identify most illegals, and provide a way to manage all those illegals so as to provide American business with the labor pool it needs without bankrupting local governmenets and depressing the overall wage scale of American workers? And there is the rub. The Bill&#8217;s very complexity suggests a Rube Goldberg contraption, an example of governmental ineffectiveness born of politcal compromise. And that potential ineffectiveness comes with a potential price tag that is staggering both in dollars and missed opportunities. And I for one am still waiting to hear the arguments supporting that alleged effectiveness. â Posted by Barton Keyes Well now&#8230;&#8230;isn&#8217;t this right out of the McCain playbook? He &#8220;walks&#8221; through an Iraqi marketplace recently, protected by an arsenal of weaponry&#8230;..whereupon, he declared the Iraqi open market as safe as one in Indiana&#8230;..as helicopters loaded with armed military personnel hovered overhead ready to shoot dead anyone who dared aproach him. He really is a very tired, old man who has lost every shred of credibility. No surprise here why he would make his announcement regarding the immigration bill in Miami. A vocal fan-base of pro-immigration Cuban expats&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s the same-old, same-old insincerity that McCain has become famous for&#8230;.He really is a very tired, old man. Poor John&#8230;he was once a political figure of some stature. I admired him back in 2000, but quickly became disgusted at his &#8220;roll-over and play dead for Bush&#8221; performance. I have often wondered if he made an agreement with the evil empire-builders to back away and let them do their &#8216;magic&#8217; and they would clear the way for him in a subsequent election scenario. It just goes to show you, one can never make a bargain with the devil. â Posted by Peter G. John you server your country very well.Please stop now before we must disreguard you. The American people do not desire and will not tolarate aleins in this country. â Posted by patricia spencer The solution is to enforce the laws against hiring illegal immigrants that we already have had on the books for decades; something that big business and greedy Repblicans have never been willing to do because they like their slave labor too much. I wish this snake-tounged devil were from any other state than mine because he makes me embarrased to be from Arizona. â Posted by Russell Vandercook We can secure our borders , enforce our laws &#8220;WITHOUT&#8221; rewarding twenty million illegals(not 12 they really don&#8217;t even know how many) with citenship - as for deportation - enforce our laws , cut off the supply of employers and they will self deport ! By the way Mr. McCain would you lke to tell he American taxpayer about the 2.6 TRILLION this will cost them ??? â Posted by bill What a mess Republicans have created for themselves - stoking fear and hatred for so long of everyone who isn&#8217;t white, heterosexual and Christian. Now Republican politicians want to change the rules since Hispanics are rapidly becoming too numerous to slight. The base isn&#8217;t buying it and McCain&#8217;s desperate religious angle won&#8217;t work either - God&#8217;s children. John, don&#8217;t you know that religion was always just a fig leaf with these people? You really don&#8217;t seem to understand the foot soldiers in your own party. But, then, you were once foolish enough to criticize Falwell and Robertson. â Posted by John L. Good for McCain, standing on principle when others are folding to the extremists. Is there any possibility that &#8220;Businessman&#8221; Mitt Romney would have opposed this bill the way politician romney has? What a joke he is. â Posted by Paul '52 Maybe it is more appropriate to say, What has happened in the USA since the 1980&#8217;s government amnesty for illegal immigrants is &#8220;an unconscionable abrogation of our responsibilities to defend the security, prosperity and values of our country.â? â Posted by Former McCain Supporter McCain and his pal Ted Kennedy should both be deported to Mexico. â Posted by David Tobin I am a Democrat but I will vote for this man. â Posted by Brad Martin The United States of America has at various times offered to open the gates to Mexicans when it was convenient politically and economically to do so. It extended a hand of brotherhood to Mexico as it planned it&#8217;s NAFTA pact. When the promises laid out did not meet expetations the people affected by this agreement (imposed) had little choice but to seek a better life here. My problem with the immigration legislation is that it carries on abaout Immigrants when we are really mostly talking about Mexicans. It is even harder for me not to see the hipocrisy playing out. It seems politicians forget that Mexicans have the same access to information we have here. We have heard it all before and it still stinks of discrimination. No matter how nicely you word it. â Posted by Hugo Claudin John, you got my vote (for what it&#8217;s worth). Stirring speech, and a great example of common-sense conservatism. Bravo. â Posted by hankrearden73 Illegal immigrants all across Southwest Florida are saying the bill is nice, but that they proably won&#8217;t bother to sign up for the program becuase it is expensive, complicated, and they will stay here anyway no matter what legislation passes in Washington. â Posted by Stephen That&#8217;s a great filibuster! Too bad there weren&#8217;t any real reporters around to ask him tough questions that would have easily demolished his arguments. In IA over the weekend, McCain said we might have Paris-style riots if we didn&#8217;t give millions of illegal aliens amnesty. What he&#8217;s saying in effect is that our government has allowed the country to be invaded, and now we&#8217;re forced to capitulate. If you look at his past statements, you&#8217;ll see he&#8217;s been quite supportive of illegal immigration (lest we have mythical $5 lettuce). So, he&#8217;s to an extent help put the U.S. in the extremely serious situation of being forced to either capitulate or face urban chaos. What word do we apply to people like that? It starts with a &#8220;Q&#8221;&#8230; (The NYT shouldn&#8217;t worry about anything written above. You keep concentrating on providing a transcription service. Let us do the heavy lifting.) â Posted by LonewackoDotCom Even God does not let everyone into heaven who wants to go there. He has rules they must follow first. Neither should U.S. allow entry to all rulebreakers who want it. â Posted by Dominoe In my opinion there are two types of illegal immigrants,one who have entered the country legally but have gone out of status and the other who have come in the country without any legal document by crossing the border.These two cases must be treated separately,they are not the same under any civilised law. â Posted by Singh,Gurudayal Here what to do with Iillegal Aliens #1 Seal the Border,#2Deport all illegal immigrants,#crack down on employers who hire illegal.The Illegal aliens are sending a clear message on the streets of Los Angels and other major urban center they are saying this is our land white, Black and legal Hispanics get out.'&#8217; No Amnesty â Posted by Annabelle Brice I do not always agree with Senator McCain&#8217;s positions on the issues but I have enormous respect for his integrity and character. Once again he shows his leadership in the immigration issue. The difference between McCain&#8217;s straitforward approach and the &#8220;nuanced&#8221; positons of Romney and Giuliani is striking. McCain recognizes the problem and states his position. Whether it is popular or not is irrelevant. Contrast this to the poll-driven approach where the other candidates pander to the so-called conservative Republican base. I prefer to hear the cold, hard facts from an honorable man, Senator John McCain&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Mike â Posted by Michael ScullioN If this Government refuses to abide by our Constitution against Invasion, Refuses to enforce current Immigration Laws and refuses to Honor their office why should anyone believe they will ever enforce any Immigration Laws or close our Borders? After all we have 40 years of History to prove they always lie and forget about the enforcement part as soon as they get their Amnesty! â Posted by BL If I steal a car, can I keep it and just pay a small fine? Illegal aliens, most of whom are not thieves, nevertheless broke our laws when they entered the US illegally. Some adopted false documentation to facilitate their job search. Many have used such documentation to access social programs and medical care. There is a solution to illegal immigration that will not require losing our sovereignty. The first step is to secure the border, and do whatever is necessary, including building a fence, to make this happen. The second step is to enforce existing laws, and fine employers who recruit and hire illegals. Also, deny illegals access to all social programs who cannot prove citizenship (except medical care for humanitarian and public health purposes). When illegals can no longer work, they will deport themselves back to their home country (and take their American-born children with them). Some public money may be necessary to facilitate this process, which will take several years. But unless our borders are secured first, the immigration problem cannot be solved. Illegals must take their place in line and go through the existing legal immigration process. This process is currently perhaps too lengthy and needs to be improved, but it has oversight and controls already built into it. For those industries that need seasonal help, or temporary and immediate expansion of their workforce to meet production needs, a separate program will be required to systematically, and in a controlled manner, supply the needs of business. This bad immigration bill currently in debate in Congress, if enacted, would bankrupt Social Security and Medicare and is far too byzantine, with little or no oversight or controls, to have any chance at being successful. â Posted by Bill Warren If politicians running for office cannot do their jobs, then why are they running for reelection or an upgrade to the presidency? The past protends the future. â Posted by J. Gilbert How does McCain suggest we defend our borders? Shall we build a fence around the entire southern and northern borders? So far, more people who want to harm us have apparently come into this country legally, and also through the Canadian border. Most people think of the illegals who are here as Mexicans, but there are a huge amount of illegal Canadians and Europeans, unnoticed because they are white. I don&#8217;t dispute that we need security, but, as a wise man once said, &#8220;Those who exchange freedom for security are destined to have neither.&#8221; â Posted by cora THere has been a slient amnesty for 16 years. McCain and Kenedy ask,&#8221; Why stop now?&#8221; I think if we continue to approve of illegal behvior through amnesty we threaten the well being of this nation. It is true that we tacitly opened our borders for the sake of big business and cheap labor for the priviledged. We have allowed massive and agressive illegal imigration for short sighted benefit. However, the interests of most of those who are here illgally do not align with the interests of most of this nation. Many of the illegals are providing a cash supply for Mexico&#8217;s economy while and siphoning social service funding from the working poor. Further, the current numbers of illegals from Mexico are unpreccedednted and the aggressive anti-American sentiment of many of the illegals, who openly state their right to &#8220;retake the territory lost to the US&#8221; must be recognized and adressed in any bill that is serious. â Posted by mike Cardone There has been a silent amnesty for 16 years.

And by no means are they the poorest. Do our leaders have in mind an ideal number for America&#8217;s population? 500 million? 0ne billion? Unfortunately, allowing that many in would not alleviate worldwide poverty or benefit our nation.

Skip to next paragraph Kent Kriegshauser/The Register Mail, via Associated Press Gene Denisar, the schools superintendent in Galesburg, Ill., left, with Andrew Thomas Johnson, a senior, at graduation ceremonies in May. On May 27, Galesburg High School students and their parents were asked to sign a contract promising to act in dignified way. Violators were warned they could be denied their diplomas and barred from an after-graduation party. Many schools ask spectators to hold applause and cheers until the ceremonies end but few rigidly enforce the policy. It was like one of the worst days of my life, said Caisha Gayles, one of the five students, who officially graduated, but does not have her diploma to frame and hang on her wall. You walk across the stage and then you cant get your diploma because of other people cheering for you. It was devastating. The school said the five students can still get their diplomas by completing eight hours of public service, answering phones, sorting books or doing other work for the district. School officials in Galesburg, a city of 34,000 in northwestern , said the policy was adopted after hoots, hollers and even air horns drowned out much of the ceremony in 2005 and nearly touched off fights in the audience when the unruly were asked to quiet down. Lots of parents complained that they could not hear their own childs name called, said Joel Estes, the schools assistant superintendent. And I think that led us to saying we have to do something about this to restore some dignity and honor to the ceremony so that everyone can appreciate it and enjoy it. In Indianapolis, public school officials this year began removing cheering parents and relatives. At one school, the superintendent interrupted the graduation program in the gymnasium last month and had the police remove a woman. Its an important, solemn occasion, said Clarke Campbell, president of the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners. Theres plenty of time for celebration before and after. Four of the five Galesburg students who were denied diplomas are black and one is Hispanic. Parents say cheers also erupted for white students but none of those students was denied a diploma. Principal Tom Chiles said administrators who monitored the 2,000-seat auditorium reported only disruptions they considered significant, and all turned in the same five names. Race had absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever, Mr. Chiles said. It is the amount of disruption at the time of the incident. School officials said they would listen to appeals from students and parents. Ms. Gayless mother, Carolyn, said she would try to get her daughters diploma. She said the noise was like three seconds: it was like, Yay, and that was it. Edward Yohnka, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union , said Galesburgs policy raised no red flags as long as it was enforced equitably. Its probably well within the schools ability to control the decorum at an event like this, Mr. Yohnka said. Another student who was denied a diploma, Nadia Trent, said: Its not fair. Somebody could not like me and just decide to yell to get me in trouble. I cant control everyone, just the ones I gave tickets to. More Articles in National &#x00bb; Dont have TimesSelect? What are you waiting for? Try it free for 14 days.
