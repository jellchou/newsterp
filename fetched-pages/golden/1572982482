http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6708387.stm | South East Wales | Iraq death man 'planned to leave' News in video and audio GMT 14:49 death man 'planned to leave' Mr Clarke guarded convoys transporting food and medical supplies A security guard killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq had concerns about the company he was working for and planned to return home, an inquest has heard. Kenny Clarke, 39, from Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, was escorting lorries carrying ammunition north of Baghdad when his vehicle hit a landmine. The explosion in June 2006 killed the former Parachute Regiment corporal and two others inside. A verdict of unlawful killing was returned at the Newport inquest. During the hearing, Mr Clarke's wife Karen told how her husband was just days away from returning to the UK. The coroner was told Mr Clarke had joined the armed forces at the age of 21 and had served in Kosovo and Iraq before he retired in 2001. After being unable to find a job in the UK, Mr Clarke started work as a security guard with Securiforce in Iraq. Mrs Clarke said the work mainly involved transporting food and medical supplies. Six months later, he started work with Rover Global Services where he was in command of a small unit employed to guard ammunition convoys, the court was told. Mr Clarke was working as a security guard in Tikrit "He wasn't too happy with the circumstances surrounding the job, and the way the convoys were run," said Mrs Clarke. The coroner David Bowen said to her: "He expressed concern to you as to the way things were going out there, in particular the personal weapons being issued to him to carry out his job." Mrs Clarke told the hearing how her husband had planned to return home on 13 June with the intention of staying in the UK or returning to his previous employers, Securiforce. But just two days before he was due to return home, Mrs Clarke received a faxed letter from Rover Global Services that he had died in an explosion caused by "a roadside improvised device". The managing director of Rover Global Services, Robert Ryan, said in a statement read to the court that documents about Mr Clarke's death could not be found as the in-country manager at the time had since left. However, he said he was aware Mr Clarke had been leading a convoy of five vehicles that stopped at an American ammunition camp north of Baghdad on the night of 10 June. He said after they left the camp the following morning, the front vehicle struck a landmine, blowing up the vehicle. In the statement, Mr Ryan described the area as "dangerous", and said the road was "well-known to the enemy". "Everyone, including Mr Clarke, knew the dangers of working there," said Mr Ryan. Medical tests showed Mr Clarke had died from massive extensive full-body burns and his identity had to be confirmed by DNA tests. The coroner said: "The type of work he was doing was extremely hazardous. "You only have to turn on the television every day to see how hazardous it is. "No part of the country is safe." He said the device would have been laid by insurgents, with the "express aim of killing, or at least seriously maiming". out more about what is going on across the region Security guard dies in Iraq blast 14 Jun 06 | Wales Tributes to guard killed in Iraq 15 Jun 06 | Wales TOP SOUTH EAST WALES STORIES 'Stolen' Aborigine apology demand Iraq death man 'planned to leave' One of two missing girls is found

Patrick Marshall, 46, was shot dead outside the Park Tavern in Basford in February 2004. Derrick Senior was shot on his driveway but survived. John McSally, 50, of Plaza Gardens, Basford, was convicted of murder and attempted murder at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday. McSally, who denied the charges, was ordered to serve a minimum of 35 years. Even by the warped standards of those who enforce their will by violence these were evil offences Mr Marshall was gunned down in the car park of the Park Tavern pub on 8 February 2004 - three months before Mr Senior was shot. The court heard Patrick Marshall, who was wrongly suspected of being an informant, had arranged to meet his killer, who he thought was going to sell him a gun. Youth worker Derrick Senior was shot days after he helped to jail four men who carried out a racist attack on him in a pub. The court was told the convicted men were part of a gang, who then wanted revenge by ordering McSally to "send him a message". He was shot five times through the window of his car as he reversed down his driveway on Harmston Rise, Basford. Prosecutor Timothy Spencer said Mr Senior survived the ordeal by "playing dead" and slumping forward on to the wheel of his car. Mr Justice Pitchers, said McSally was an "incredibly dangerous" man. He said: "Even by the warped standards of those who enforce their will by violence these were evil offences. Patrick Marshall was shot dead outside the Park Tavern "Patrick Marshall has done nothing to deserve any sort of attack, let alone to be summarily executed by you with a firearm. "Derrick Senior is a thoroughly decent, law-abiding member of the community who had done nothing more than wish to see justice done in a case where he had been subjected to a racial attack." McSally, who did not react to the verdict told the judge the sentence would be "no problem". Craig McKay, 33, of Derby Road, Stapleford, was cleared of Mr Marshall's murder on Friday. Mr McKay's girlfriend Sally Weetman, 37, also of Derby Road, Stapleford, was also cleared of perverting the course of justice.

Adam Rickwood, 14, became the youngest person to die in custody in Britain in modern times, in 2004. Adam, from Burnley, Lancashire, was on remand at the Hassockfield Secure Training Unit, County Durham. He wrote to his mother saying he would kill himself if forced to stay in the unit, the jury at Chester-le-Street Magistrates' Court heard. Jurors deliberated for almost a week after the month-long hearing. Adam was found dead about a month after being sent on remand to the unit, in July 2004. He had suffered from mental health problems, drink and drug abuse and had suicidal tendencies, Chester-le-Street Magistrates' Court heard. The last letter the teenager wrote to his mother was read to the jury. It said: "I need to be at home with you. I need to be at home in my own bed or my head will crack up. "I will probably try to kill myself and I will probably succeed this time.

Paul Nicholl, 19, was driving his new BMW along the A95 near Keith on Tuesday night when the car left the road. It landed upside down next to the Aberdeen to Inverness line. Relatives said Mr Nicholl was "one in a million". His grandfather was buried on Monday and his mother said it was unusual for her son to be on that road. It was very unusual for him to be on that road and I wonder if he had been to the cemetery Apprentice joiner Mr Nicholl, from Keith, was cut free from the wreckage but was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said the car appeared to have somersaulted several times after leaving the road, following a spell of heavy rain. The railway line and the A95 were both closed for several hours following the accident. Slight damage was caused to the train, which was heading north and no passengers were injured. Mr Nicholl's mother Sheila said: "He was super, I wouldn't have changed him for the world. "He was very close to his sisters and younger brother and had a wide circle of friends who described him as one of the best friends they ever had. He was also very close to all his other relatives. "He had been keen to get this car for some time He had only had it for three weeks and was so proud of it." Grampian Police are investigating the accident It was the second sadness the family endured this week, as Mrs Nicholl buried her father, Bob Legge, on Monday. She believes Mr Nicholl may have been returning home from visiting his grandfather's grave when the accident happened. She said: "He always came home by a different route. It was very unusual for him to be on that road and I wonder if he had been to the cemetery." Grampian Police Inspector Ian Kirkwood said: "This was a particularly horrific crash which could have had horrendous consequences had the vehicle come to rest on the rail tracks. "Thankfully the train made only a glancing blow to the BMW and train passengers were probably unaware of the incident."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/uk/6708705.stm | 21/7 accused 'had explosive list' GMT 15:42 accused 'had explosive list' Adel Yahya is one of six men who deny terrorism charges One of the 21 July terror suspects kept a list of explosives on a CD Rom seized by the authorities, a court has heard. Adel Yahya, 24, of Tottenham, north London, also stored a book titles relating to chemical and biological warfare, Woolwich Crown Court was told. Mr Yahya said he signed a property list confirming he owned the CD Rom only because he feared it would be stolen. Mr Yahya and five other men all deny conspiracy to murder and to cause explosions likely to endanger life. The CD Rom was seized when Mr Yahya was arrested in Ethiopia in November 2005 following a request by UK authorities. He told the court that the item, which contained a large Excel spreadsheet with 97 chapters written in English, belonged to his uncle in Ethiopia. One chapter listed details of explosives; another chemicals and a third book titles, including Aircraft Safety, Terrorist Target Selection, Biological Warfare, Chemical Warfare Agents and Jihad: The Origin of the Holy War in Islam. Another chapter, about chemicals and fertiliser, included 29 sources of hydrogen peroxide in concentrations of 27.5% to 50%. Max Hill, prosecuting, said: "Your role in this conspiracy included using your knowledge to set about obtaining the highest concentration you and your co-defendants could find." Mr Yahya denied knowing about the list and said: "What you are saying is absolute rubbish." Mr Yahya admitted he asked about the highest percentage concentration of hydrogen peroxide sold at a cosmetics shop in Finsbury Park, north London, twice in May and June 2005. He said he did it because that was what co-defendant Yassin Omar wanted him to ask. Mr Yahya said the chemical was needed for bleaching wood. But Mr Hill accused him of wanting a higher percentage to make explosives. "The truth is Mr Yahya, you were the man who was in charge then, weren't you?" said Mr Hill. Mr Yahya went on holiday to Ethiopia with his wife on 11 June 2005. He is one of six men accused of taking part in an extremist Muslim plot to carry out a series of suicide bombings on the London's public transport network in 2005. In the dock are Ramzi Mohammed, 25, of North Kensington, west London; Hussain Osman, 28, of no fixed address; Muktar Said Ibrahim, 29, from Stoke Newington, north London; Mr Omar, 26, from New Southgate, north London; Mr Yahya; and Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, 34, of no fixed address.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6707509.stm | Manchester | GMT 12:20 chairs were installed in 2006 (photo from MEN Syndication) Firefighters in Greater Manchester are facing disciplinary action over claims they slept on a station floor instead of their new reclining chairs. Three men, based in Bury, are being investigated for "involvement in the use of unauthorised rest facilities". It is claimed they broke regulations by using sleeping bags on the floor rather than the £400 chairs. The chairs were installed as part of modernisation programme to replace all beds in the region's 41 fire stations. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said the men were all asleep as a team of inspectors from the fire service carried out a spot check early one morning. Obviously what we are looking for is for common sense to prevail "We have now christened them the furniture police," said Manchester regional secretary Kevin Brown. Mr Brown said the service launched an investigation into the incident and the men were due to appear before a level three disciplinary hearing on 14 June. "A level three hearing leaves open the possibility for dismissal - this is how ludicrous this is," said Mr Brown. "Obviously what we are looking for is for common sense to prevail. "These people work a 15-hour night shift and they are entitled to take rest periods." Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said the inquiry concerned "involvement in the use of unauthorised rest facilities". "A full internal investigation into this matter is under way and no further comment can be made at this time," a spokesman said. The service bought more than 300 of the chairs last year after chiefs decided to remove beds from dormitories across the region. But firefighters were not allowed to sit or lie on the devices before reading a four-page health and safety manual. and features on the BBC's Manchester website Chair 'danger' for firefighters 27 Jan 06 | Manchester Fire service beds to be scrapped 26 Mar 05 | Manchester Fire service shake-up unveiled 13 Jan 04 | UK Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service Salford move gets green light widening report welcomed

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6707873.stm | GMT 14:47 forces across the country are cracking down on tinted car windows. But what's driving the craze among drivers for a darkened view of the road? So there you are waiting at the lights in your standard-spec Ford Focus when another car pulls alongside. It appears the driver wants to share his music with you... and the rest of the neighbourhood. But when you glance around, it seems he doesn't particularly want you to see inside his car. His windows are tinted. They are as dark as his alloy hubcaps are bright. There are criminals who seek to hide behind the windows - the question is, what have you got to hide? Over the last two years, police forces as far afield as Northern Ireland, Devon, Manchester and Strathclyde have been cracking down on tinted windows. The law states front windows must allow 70% of light through; the front windscreen 75%. Yet there are illegal tints out there letting as little as 5% light through. Traffic officers believe such excessive tints are potentially dangerous, particularly at night, and they are increasingly armed with optical meters. In Manchester, more than 2,000 fixed penalty notices have been issued to drivers of cars with excessively tinted windows since October 2006. Police have handed out 520 prohibitions, forcing drivers to take their cars off the roads while they have their windows restored, 80 of which were in the last fortnight. Pc Dave Barrow, of Greater Manchester Police, says offenders break down into three groups. Fans try to emulate their limousine-carried idols "There's the innocent purchaser of a nice car where the garage have said we can tint the windows so it looks nicer. There are criminals who seek to hide behind the windows. The question is, what have you got to hide? "Then there are the cars with loud music blaring and tinted windows are a bit of a fashion accessory." Forces cite the fall-out from a serious accident involving a motorcycle and a car with heavily tinted windows, as the impetus for this current crackdown. Peter Grunert, deputy editor of Top Gear magazine, blames an increasingly celebrity-obsessed media for driving "People want some of that. Cachet is reflected in the cars they drive," he says. "Super-sized chrome rims, massive sound systems, DVD, and mystery glass, the full package. An element of that is coming over to the UK." Go on a website advertising tinted windows and you'll see references to "a touch of distinction", and products like "light smoke", "midnight" and "limo". Without tinting you can see the seats and the rubbish strewn everywhere Mark Needham, who promotes custom cars events, says tinted windows are the first port of call for any aspirant boy racer. He has them on his own car. "It makes the car look a lot more stylish. Without tinting, you can see the seats and the rubbish strewn everywhere. You modify as much as you can within the law. But some people push the boundaries a lot," says Mr Needham. The trend for even subtle tinting is a recent one. Once they were a swanky optional extra in the 1980s. Now most new cars come with almost the maximum legal tint as standard. Anything beyond that tends to be added by specialist fitters, using films on the inside of windows. Tom Hardyment, general manager of tint and security film specialists Pentagon, says his firm does 4,000 car tints a year. But it's a myth that boy racers are driving demand. Instead, the typical customer is an affluent mother with small 4x4 or people carrier, who wants the back windows done to save the kids from sunburn and stop them getting grumpy in the heat. Other customers are government and business. Rapper Busta Rhymes was pulled over for excessively tinted windows "It is growing, corresponding to sales of small SUVs. They are greenhouses on wheels. People like it, it protects their kids, they can watch their DVDs. It's 60% practical, 40% cosmetic. You've got a few people running around who reckon they are hoodies, running around spoiling it. People who have tinted front windows - it's stupid and illegal." But he still thinks a little dash of darkening is aesthetically pleasing. "You can pretty much pick any car you like and the press shots will have very heavily tinted windows, including the windscreen. It lowers the roofline, gives it a more sporty look." Kevin Wing, owner of the Tinted Windows Company in Watford, says the link between tinting and crime is a myth and instead points to supposed environmental benefits. "It makes the car run more economically because you don't use so much air conditioning. I get a lot of customers who say I don't want to look like a drug dealer. But that's a myth. It would be a bit like having a robber with swag written on his bag. My main customer is a woman with a multi-passenger vehicle." But Mr Wing admits he tints front windows and windscreens at levels greater than the law allows to be driven on the roads, insisting that many of his customers are using cars in adverts or shows. "I try to angle people into having the legal limit... It is entirely up to you what you do with your vehicle on the highway. How can you tell if someone's going to use it for a show purpose or not?" But just as police are getting wise to the trend, Steve Chalmers, editor of Fast Car magazine, says drivers' interest is starting to wane. "I've been in cars with the heavy tints and it's very claustrophobic. I would say it is starting to die out slowly. It was a big thing a few years back." Send us your comments using the form below. "Instead, the typical customer is an affluent mother with small 4x4 or people carrier, who wants the back windows done to save the kids from sunburn" Most ultraviolet radiation is blocked by glass. In particular those with shorter wavelengths, (UVB rays) do not pass through glass. Since UVB is the primary cause of redness and sunburn, I am at a loss why the children of these Chelsea-tractor driving mothers are defying the laws of physics and getting sunburnt through the window. Of course, the concerned parent could be worried about the effects of UVA rays, which have longer wavelengths and can make it through glass. UVA rays can cause skin ageing and research is now demonstrating that it may also be a risk factor for skin cancer and in addition to this some tinting process can make windows impenetrable to UVA rays. However UVA rays do not cause sunburn. However, anyone who has sat through a GCSE physics lesson on ultraviolet should already know all this¿ Jonathan Pearson, Towcester, U.K. There are regular arguments over tinting on automotive internet forums - people whining about getting pulled over because they've got their front windows tinted - it's like complaining because you've been pulled over for speeding - it's illegal, you've knowingly done something illegal and you've been caught. Shut up, frankly. Quite why those people who tint their front windows are so ashamed of being seen out in their vehicle is a total mystery to me. You can't get sunburn through glass. Although hats off to the fitter who takes a bundle off the 4x4 owner who doesn't know this. My brother had his windows tinted because he doesn't want to wear a seat-belt!! Pete, Stratford upong Avon The link between criminality and tinted windows is just a myth. It's simply another revenue-making scheme for the police; yes, if your windows allow less than 70% of light through, you're technically breaking the law, but then if you gamble for money in your own home, you're also technically breaking the law. I really wish the police would spend less time on things like this and more time on the important issues affecting this country. I admit that my windows are tinted more than the current law allows (they were like this when I purchased the car) but they in no way impede my ability to see... I think you'd have to have something like a 75% tint for it to actually prevent you from seeing properly. It does, however, impede people outside my car from seeing in and, let's face it, that's my personal choice. I have the windows tinted on my LWB 4x4, from the B pillar back, all legal. It makes it look better and stops prying eyes looking into the back. My mother has even ordered tints on her new vehicle. I totally agree with the police crack down on these illegal side window tints. As a motorcyclist it's hard enough to be seen, but when someone is looking out of a side window with a limo tint on it their vision is vastly reduced and you have no eye contact with the driver. There is a car driving around my home town with very dark tins on all the windows and the driver also have three quarters of his windscreen tinted from the top down! That car on a country road, a pedestrian with dark cloths on or a broken down or badly parked vehicle, well, disaster waiting to happen. John Rymer, Carrickfergus. N. Ireland I live in the Middle East where many cars are very heavily tinted, either to keep out the sun or for reasons of modesty. The tints are lethal and are well established here as the cause of many severe accidents. There have been countless occasions when drivers have gone through red lights - with fatal consequences - because the tint alters the appearance of colours. Not only that, but being unable to see a driver pulling up to a junction as you drive along a main road means you cannot make eye contact and you cannot read body language to gauge their intentions. Finally anyone who has been a passenger in a heavily tinted car at night - I have - knows that it makes pedestrians harder to see. The blazing sun is partly an excuse for tints in the Middle East - there's no such excuse in the UK. Lesley Cain, Dubai, UAE What a refeshing change - car drivers being penalised for illegal tints. It's usually the (mainly) law-abiding motorcyclist who bears the brunt of the heavy-handed approach often adopted by the police for daring to wear a tinted visor for daytime riding in order to avoid being dazzled by the sun. Most are not illegal and a spare, clear visor is carried for when light and visibilty are reduced. Obviusly, this is so that we can ride safely and sunglasses are not always convenient. When learning to ride my bike a useful tip was to use other vehicles waiting alongside me at junctions as windows in order to obtain a clear view of the traffic around me (useful advice for car drivers, too). However, this is impossible when surrounded by a growing number or cars with "blacked-out" windows and it's even harder to see around large 4x4s and people carriers . Tinted windows have been around since at least 1973. I remember the DIY paint-on kits and stick on film that you could buy, but even then there was a legal limit to how to dark they were allowed to be. Susan Richards, Penarth, South Glam. Tinted windows prevent a clear view of the other driver and thus facial expressions, gestures ¿ eye contact in general, often valuable indicators to the other's intention. In a complicated driving environment such clues are essential. John Davis, Manchester, UK/Philadelphia, USA As a cyclist/motorcyclist, I find it very useful to look drivers in the eye when they are waiting at junctions, to confirm that I have indeed been noticed. Tinted windows prevent this and are therefore dangerous from my point of view. Many years ago (probably ten) people could drive what car they wanted in any colour they wanted without being labelled. Nowadays everything is aimed against car drivers, whether it be tinted windows, 4x4s, or where you are allowed to drive or park. We now live in a country where the police are only interested in motorists and the minority tell the majority exactly how and what they are allowed to do. I think complaining about tints is just another way of pursuing motorists whilst avoiding real causes. There are many benefits to tinted windows, as mentioned above, reduced glare, cooler ambient temperatures, and better protection to vehicle interiors. I haven't seen anyone stopped for their sunglasses to be checked and these often allow less light through than window tints. Where does the law stand on that? "I get a lot of customers who say I don't want to look like a drug dealer [...] My main customer is a woman with a multi-passenger vehicle." Seriously though, this protest smacks of racial profiling: no-one can "conceal their identity" from the police because they can check your plates... But how will they know if a car's being driven by a young black man if they can't see through the windows? All windows on all cars should be clear plain glass, with 0% of allowable tint.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/magazine/6702315.stm | Ethics of reality TV 30 May 2007, 12:45 GMT 13:45 of reality TV Last year's winner had Tourette's - what twist is in store this time? The Big Brother circus is starting again, with even a "topsy turvy" house to toy with its contestants' minds. As the makers of reality TV shows seek new ways to shock, ethicists Daniel Sokol and James Wilson evaluate the fall-out. Reality TV thrives on extreme circumstances. In the past week, Dutch programme makers have faced censure for a show in which the prize is a life-saving kidney, and Australian Big Brother for keeping a contestant in the dark when her father died. The mind games look set to continue with the UK's eighth series of Big Brother about to start. As well as entertainment, the series is an experiment into human behaviour. Yet, unlike research which uses human participants, there are no ethical safeguards to minimise the risks to those involved. All medical research must be reviewed by an independent ethics committee. And in education, universities usually require even undergraduate students to get "ethics approval" if a project involves human participants. Compete for a kidney? Projects that would be rejected by the most lenient of ethics committees appear regularly on our TV screens. Contestants may be asked by authority figures to perform acts which may be distressing or humiliating, and which may be difficult to refuse. A refusal may lead to eviction, criticism by fellow contestants, losing a privilege or incurring some other kind of penalty. Contestants may also worry about the reaction of the viewing public and its impact on their reputation and career prospects. They may feel coerced to do something they would not otherwise do. In research involving humans, consent is vital. In reality TV, however, contestants' consent to participate may be grossly inadequate. Are they provided with enough information to make an informed decision, or are some important details deliberately downplayed or withheld? Space Cadets: The joke's on you Some reality TV shows rely on deception for their success. Contestants may mistakenly believe they are in a spacecraft, or that they are talking in confidence when other contestants can hear every word. Therein lies the entertainment. Another concern is whether consent is truly voluntary. Cash prizes may be irresistible carrots which blind them to the implications of their participation. The prospect of fame, celebrity interviews, pictures in glossy magazines and invitations to glamorous parties may further undermine their ability to think rationally. How do we know if the participants are competent to take part? Some have appeared on the edges of sanity and, in at least one instance, a contestant threatened to commit suicide. We may wonder whether the pre-show psychological assessment is screening unstable individuals out, or in. Whether or not qualified psychologists should get involved is a related question, especially as they know such projects would never be approved in an academic setting. Should their professional ethics forbid their participation? There are many other ethical considerations, such as in what circumstances should the show be stopped or modified? What kind of support or counselling will be provided for the contestants afterwards? Danielle Lloyd makes up with Shilpa Shetty post-Celebrity Big Brother The recent dilemma faced by the Australian Big Brother producers, when a contestant's father died while she was in the house, reflects the need to consider such ethical issues in advance. It seems inconsistent to require ethics approval to protect participants in medical and educational contexts, but not reality TV shows. The fact that something is to be broadcast as entertainment does not remove the duty to treat other human beings decently. Independent ethics committees, made up of people from production companies, broadcasting, academic institutions and the general public, could be set up to evaluate reality TV proposals. These could critically review proposals, suggest changes if necessary or reject projects outright. This will not mean the death of the genre, but producers will need to consider their ethical responsibilities before proposing ever more daring shows. Some may think "ah, but these shows won't be fun anymore". But the committee's role would not be to reduce the entertainment value, but to ensure that it doesn't come at too high a moral cost. If people want to take part in potentially painful or embarrassing shows, that's up to them, but they should understand what they are signing up for. And surely we should not tolerate ill treatment for the sake of entertainment. In medicine, regulations and codes of ethics followed the revelation of highly unethical research conducted during World War II. In reality TV, contestants will not be injected with cholera or forced to drink sea water, as in the Nazi medical experiments of the 1940s. But the risk of severe harm, especially psychological distress, remains. Dr Daniel Sokol and Dr James Wilson are lecturers in ethics at Keele University. Below is a selection of your comments. Humans are always curious to see other peoples' behaviour and reactions. Long standing TV soaps prove this point as they are based on normal everyday events that people can relate to. Shows such as Big Brother further extend this reach into human curiosity. However, by controlling functions in their environment does not represent reality TV as a certain reaction is almost guaranteed by the participants. Martin John, Cairo, Egypt We have enough nannying from the Government as it is - without having to introduce measures designed to cater for those few individuals who are not able to weigh up the pros & cons of being a contestant on a reality show. I would hope (& assume) that producers go to great lengths to ensure that participants understand exactly what they are letting themselves in for when signing up. Matt G Baish, Cheltenham, UK The BB contestants know exactly what they are getting into, and they can always walk out as many do. Many do it for their 5 minutes of fame, others hoping to launch a media career whatever the cost. There are two types of people who complain about BB, experts and viewers unable to operate the off button. Neither group seems to have any argument which stands up to analysis. The recent racism row and the subsequent accusations of the production company "burying" unsavoury footage clearly show the programme makers' concern is on ratings rather than the housemates' well being. The Quiet Man, Warrington What rubbish. Contestants on BB know exactly what they are letting themselves in for and have done ever since series 2; they choose to do it because they know that the fame and fortune are worth it. Geoff Winkless, Leicestershire, UK Surely there is a simple answer to anyone suffering ethical concerns about reality TV? Just don't watch it. What is the point in vetting a reality TV program it would defeat the whole purpose of it being a REALITY program, plus it would be boring. Outrageous people and how they behave is the reason why we all watch it. They know the risks of entering the house and they know they can pull out at any time so situations never have to become so bad I think every last detail of what goes on should be explicit and the participants informed of this in detail and in advance of the filming. Only by removing the uncertainty and thus the so called entertainment from these reality shows can we finally get rid of the genre and get back to quality entertainment. to limit C02 emissions?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/south_asia/6707929.stm | South Asia | Taleban 'downed Nato helicopter' GMT 14:20 'downed Nato helicopter' Nato says one of its helicopters that crashed in the southern Afghan province of Helmand on Wednesday may have been shot down by the Taleban. Seven people died in the crash, five of them US crew. Two military passengers - one British, one Canadian - also died. Nato-led troops are fighting militants nearby. Dozens of Taleban were killed or injured, Afghan officials say. Elsewhere, at least 16 policemen died in a Taleban ambush in southern Zabul province, the interior ministry said. Fighting between Nato-led security forces and the Taleban has escalated in recent weeks - particularly in the south. Nato is still investigating the cause of Wednesday's crash, but says it looks as if Taleban claims to have shot the Chinook down may well be correct. RECENT AFGHAN AIR CRASHES - Eight US troops die in helicopter crash in Zabul province - 14 UK service personnel die in Nimrod crash in Kandahar province - Dutch F-16 fighter pilot dies in crash in south of country - 16 people of multiple nationalities die in helicopter crash in south-east - 10 US soldiers die in helicopter crash in Kunar province - Five die when US anti-drugs plane crashes in southern Afghanistan "It was a hostile area where the helicopter went down," said Major John Thomas, a spokesman for Nato's International Security Assistance Force (Isaf). "Initial indications are that enemy fire may have brought down the helicopter." The nationality of the seventh passenger is still unclear. The helicopter crashed at around 2100 (1630 GMT) in the Kajaki district of Helmand, Isaf said in a statement. A rescue patrol was ambushed by "enemy fighters" and forced to call for an air strike to access the crash site, Isaf said. Incidents of helicopters being shot down are relatively rare in the country, says the BBC's Alastair Leithead in Kabul. About 30,000 alliance troops and another 10,000 US-led ones have been battling to boost the authority of President Hamid Karzai. On Thursday, Isaf confirmed that fighting was going on against the Taleban in Sangin district, near Kajaki. A statement said air strikes had been carried out against Taleban positions. It did not say whether there had been any casualties. But the Afghan Defence Ministry said dozens of Taleban fighters had been killed or wounded. Local people have disputed the government account, saying some of those killed were civilians rather than Taleban. Sangin district police chief Ghulam Wali told the BBC the aim of the operation was to secure the road from the Shali area to Kajaki. In the ambush in Zabul, six policemen were injured as well as those killed, officials said. Interior Ministry spokesman Zmaray Bashary told the BBC that police had also inflicted heavy casualties on their attackers in a gun battle which had raged for 20 minutes. He said the ambush took place in Shahjoy district, a Taleban stronghold, as the police convoy travelled from Zabul to Ghazni. There was no way of independently verifying casualty figures in either incident. Karzai's Afghanistan still faces daunting challenges, writes Lyse Doucet.
