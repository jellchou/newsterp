Gardeners have been warned that using pesticides increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease by more than 40 per cent. An EU-funded study - one of the biggest of its kind - confirms suspicions that chemicals found in everyday products are doing untold damage to health. The study's author, Aberdeen University expert Dr Finlay Dick, called for more research to pin down products and chemicals responsible for damaging the brain. Parkinson's disease affects 120,000 Britons, with 10,000 new cases each year. Although it is most common in the over-60s, the brain disorder can strike at any time. Sufferers include actor Michael J Fox, who was just 30 when diagnosed, and former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali. For the latest study, researchers questioned 3,000 men and women, a third of whom had Parkinson's or similar conditions. The Scottish, Swedish, Italian, Romanian and Maltese volunteers were asked about their use of pesticides such as fly sprays and weedkillers over their lives, both at work and at home. They were also asked if they had ever been knocked unconscious, if they smoked, and if any family members had Parkinson's. Analysis of the results revealed that those who had used pesticides the most were 41 per cent more likely to have developed Parkinson's than those who had never been exposed to the chemicals. Even low levels of exposure raised the risk by 13 per cent. Those who had suffered repeated blows to the head were more than two and a half times more likely to have developed Parkinson's. Even a single knock-out blow raised the risk by 35 per cent, the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine-reported. Having a family history of Parkinson's also raised the odds of developing the disease. However, smoking appeared to have a protective effect, a finding which echoes many previous studies. The reason for this is thought to be that the balance of chemicals in the brain that leads to people becoming addicted to cigarettes also makes them less likely to develop Parkinson's - not that any substance in cigarettes wards off disease. Dr Kieran Breen, of the Parkinson's Disease Society, said: "The important finding from this study is that Parkinson's is not caused by any one factor, but instead a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors." Peter Sanguinetti, of the Crop Protection Association, which represents pesticide manufacturers, said that product safety is a priority. He stressed, however, that the latest study did not find conclusive evidence of a link between pesticides and Parkinson's. No comments have so far been submitted.

The Southern African country is among the worst hit by the HIV/Aids pandemic, killing more than 3 000 people every week and accounting for 70% of hospital admissions. But Zimbabwe, in the grips of a deep recession, has also become one of the few Aids bright spots on the continent after its HIV prevalence rate declined to 18,1% last year from 25% six years ago. Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said the number of people receiving the life-prolonging medicines has increased from 60 000 in December to 80 000 this month but that the government would add another 40 000 patients by the end of the year. "Currently the number of people on ARVs has grown to 80 000 since December last year and we hope to achieve our target of getting 120 000 by the end of the year," Parirenyatwa told the government controlled Parirenyatwa said that at least 300 000 people living with HIV/Aids were in urgent need of ARVs. Zimbabwe's drive to increase access to ARVs has been hampered by a severe shortage of foreign currency, itself a sign of an economic crisis that has pushed inflation past 3 700% and increased poverty levels. The crisis has been particularly felt in the health sector, where basic drugs are in short supply while strikes for better pay by doctors and nurses have worsened the situation. President Robert Mugabe -- who says Zimbabwe is showing the way for Africa in the fight against HIV/Aids -- rejects charges of mismanagement and blames the West for sabotaging the economy as punishment for seizing white-owned farms to distribute to black Zimbabweans. - Reuters Zimbabwe to boost police force for elections Most of detained Zim opposition activists freed Mugabe ready to seize foreign firms news on your cellphone (R1 one-off) or find out more Listen to the new M&G Online podcast Add M&G Online news to your website or blog Get M&G Online news in your RSS reader For more news, go to the M&G Online home page Find your match now!

They may not know they can possibly drink their way to safer skin. Bells and a breeze offer an afternoon of relaxation in the sun. But to protect yourself from sun damage and skin cancer Dermatologist Dr. Bryan Chen warns that you should follow this advice, "The use of sunscreens to cover up the best that you can from the sun, the use of hats during the day, and try to avoid the sun during the hours of 10 in the morning to two in the afternoon when the sun intensity is the greatest outdoors." He adds, "That, in combination with drinking tea, I think would be useful." Drinking just one cup of tea a day will lower your risk of getting the two most common types of skin cancer,squamos and basal cell carcinoma, reports the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. Dr. Chen says, "Teas have long been known to contain antioxidants in them, and also chemicals called polyfenals." In the first human study of more than 2,000 people, tea&#39;s antioxidants were found to limit the effects of the sun&#39;s ultraviolet rays. But, Dr Chen says tea isn&#39;t the cure all for skin cancer; "Just because you drink tea doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a 100% protection against the development of skin cancer. You really do need to do it in combination with other protective measures protect yourself from the sun." Scientists found the more tea you drink each day and over the years, the better the skin protection. It doesn&#39;t matter if the tea is hot or cold, and all types of tea offered protection, including green, black and herbal tea.

EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou did not move to impose strict rules on food companies - like those used to reduce smoking - when he unveiled his plans to combat obesity. But he warned the industry against complacency. "Industry must realise that time is running out if we are to get results at EU level. We have given them enough incentive to become more energetic and involved, or risk legislation," Mr Kyprianou said. "But it is still my belief that self-regulation gets quicker results as we all know the length of time it can take to introduce legislation." Of the 300 million adults worldwide who are technically obese or overweight, more than 15 million live in the EU. EU figures show an estimated three million European schoolchildren are now obese. Obesity could affect one in 10 children in Europe and Central Asia by 2010. Some consumer groups and non-governmental organisations had sought greater action by Brussels in its strategy paper, released today, such as tighter advertising regulations and more specific rules on food labelling. "It seems that the Commission has taken the easy way out by adopting a voluntary approach, combined with policy of wait-and-see," said Jim Murray, director of European Consumers' Organisation BEUC. "We were expecting a much more robust commitment from the Commission, taking a strong stance on nutritional labelling and introducing a binding approach to tackle the issue of advertising to children." The document upholds the model of an "obesity platform", set up by the executive Commission in 2005 following its first discussion paper on the issue. This approach brings industry, consumer groups and health experts together to find ways to combat obesity. But it emphasises self-regulation and pulls away from delivering legislation from Brussels. Both CIAA, which represents Europe's food and drink industry, and the Association of the Chocolate, Biscuit and Confectionery Industries (CAOBISCO) welcomed Wednesday's announcement. "Industry has been moving forward on this and will continue to do so. But at the end of the day its not about good and bad food, it's about good and bad diet," said David Zimmer, CAOBISCO general secretary and executive member of CIAA. Since the formation of the platform, a number of CIAA members, such as Coca Cola and Pepsi said they have stopped airing ads for children under 12 and taken vending machines out of primary schools. The paper said the Commission proposed a revision of nutrition labelling, programs to promote healthy eating, and a study on sport, among other measures. An initial report by the Commission is due in 2010.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/17-6&fd=R&url=http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/health/feeds/hscout/2007/05/30/hscout605049.html&cid=1116794948&ei=m-xeRuzZAoL0rQOB45zVDQ Parkinson's Linked to Pesticides, Head Trauma - Forbes.com Parkinson's Linked to Pesticides, Head Trauma 05.30.07, 12:00 AM ET WEDNESDAY, May 30 (HealthDay News) -- Pesticides and head injury can both bump up risks for Parkinson's disease, European researchers report. Moreover, odds for the illness increase as exposure to these brain insults rises, the report found. For example, "Those who were heavily exposed to pesticides had a 41 percent increased risk of developing Parkinson&#39;s disease, and those with lower exposure had a 13 percent increased risk," said lead researcher Dr. Finlay Dick, from the Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine at Aberdeen University Medical School, Aberdeen, U.K. In addition, people who were knocked unconscious even once had a 35 percent increased risk of developing Parkinson&#39;s, Dick said. That finding has real implications for sports such as boxing, the researchers said. In fact, professional boxing legend Muhammad Ali, 65, now suffers from advanced Parkinson&#39;s disease. The findings are published in the May 30 online edition of Occupational and Environmental Medicine According to the National Parkinson Foundation, 1.5 million Americans currently have the degenerative illness, which strikes men and women in roughly equal numbers, usually after the age of 65. In the study, Dick&#39;s team collected data on 959 people with Parkinson&#39;s or Parkinson&#39;s-like syndromes and almost 2,000 people without the condition. All the people were questioned about their exposure to pesticides as well as iron, copper and manganese. They were also asked if they had ever having been knocked unconscious or had a family history of Parkinson&#39;s disease. The team found that people who had been exposed to low levels of pesticides were 13 percent more likely to have Parkinson&#39;s compared to people who had never been exposed. And people exposed to high levels of pesticides were 41 percent more likely to develop the condition. Dick&#39;s group also found that Parkinson&#39;s disease occurred 35 percent more often in people who had been knocked unconscious once compared with those who had never been knocked out, and more than two-and-a-half times more frequently in people who had been knocked out more often. In terms of pesticides, the researchers don&#39;t know which compounds are most likely to increase the risk for Parkinson&#39;s, Dick said. More research is needed, he added. One take-home message: avoiding head injury is a good way to cut Parkinson&#39;s risk. "This has implications for contact sports, particularly for things like boxing," Dick said. One expert lauded the research. "This study adds to a growing body of evidence that points toward an association between exposure to environmental issues being related to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson&#39;s disease," said Dr. Michael S. Okun, the medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation. He speculated that environmental exposures may trigger genes that spur the illness. "In some way, environmental exposures are affecting a series of events that unfold in the human brain that result in neurodegenerative diseases," he said. While the causes of Parkinson&#39;s aren&#39;t known, Okun believes that it is a combination of factors, such as a genetic predisposition for the disease, coupled with environmental triggers. "It would be a mistake to assume that this is a disease linked directly to pesticides or linked directly to genes and to close the door on potential interactions between them," he said.

The suspects met in chat rooms on web and made dates with victims for sex parties. There victims were drugged with Gamma Hydroxy Butyrate (GHB), a neuroactive drug which make people high, and then injected with HIV-infected blood, according to police in Groningen. One of the suspects had a large amount of GHB in his possession. The remaining three suspects also had quantities of the drug, police said Wednesday. The police first received reports about the parties in June last year. The first victim filed a report in February. The suspects were all arrested in early May.

I know I would, but I am all too aware of the risks carried by UV rays. American Academy of Dermatology , there are more than one million cases of skin cancer diagnosed every year in the U.S., and one's level of sun exposure is the most preventable risk factor for the disease. Artificial methods such as tanning beds and sunlamps are just as dangerous, due to their UV-ray emission. There is one safe way, though -- faking a sun-kissed glow with self-tanning creams, sprays or wipes. The Top 10 Rocket Stocks for This Week Five Stocks With Serious 'Catch-Upside' Dykstra: A Marvellous Call on Semis 30 Stocks on Sale The Top 10 Biotech Short Squeezes There are several different ways to apply these products. If you're the type who enjoys the pampering experience, I would recommend looking at your local spa for self-tanning treatment options. But if you just want a quick dose of color, go to a department or beauty store and select from an array of products from such brands as ), Clinique, Neutrogena and Clarins (about $15-$40). Even though self-tanning products are designed for easy, at-home application, the process does require a bit of practice. Lise Jorgensen, vice president of global skincare product development at Estee Lauder recommends the following steps for an even, desirable result: Exfoliate beforehand: Smooth skin helps the color develop more evenly and last longer. Apply evenly, concentrating on one area at a time. Go lightly on areas where color can develop darker, such as elbows, knees and ankles. Blend thoroughly using small circular motions. Immediately wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Allow body formulas to dry completely before dressing. Always take your time when applying the self tanners. "Use an even coating on the shoulders, arms and legs," says Kaheem Todmann, a skincare specialist at Clarins. And beware of products that are excessively thick. " [They] can make the skin appear muddy or dirty," says Todmann. So how do self-tanning products work? Most contain a chemical called dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which reacts with the amino acids found in certain proteins in our skin. "The reaction forms a colored complex which gives the skin a tanned appearance," explains Jorgensen. DHA has been approved as a safe cosmetic ingredient by the Food and Drug Administration for decades.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070531.whospital31/BNStory/National/home&cid globeandmail.com: Neonatal unit shut after infection kills baby Letters to the Editor Neonatal unit shut after infection kills baby Globe and Mail Update May 31, 2007 at 3:34 AM EDT &#151; A highly feared bacterial infection has killed a premature baby at a downtown Toronto hospital, sparking special hygiene measures and the closing of a neonatal intensive care unit. The infant died of bacteremia, commonly known as blood poisoning, at Mount Sinai Hospital after acquiring serratia, a particularly harmful pathogen that can cause severe infections in babies, Allison McGeer, the hospital's director of infection control, confirmed in a telephone interview Wednesday. &ldquo;This is one of the organisms we really worry about it,&rdquo; Dr. McGeer said. &ldquo;... This is not an organism you take any chances with.&rdquo; In this case, the infant, described as weighing between about one and three pounds (500 and 1,500 grams), succumbed to the infection over the weekend. The gender of the child could not be provided, due to patient confidentiality, said Jodi Salem, the hospital's spokeswoman. A second baby, who also tested positive for serratia, an organism found fairly commonly in the bowels of adults, is in isolation at Mount Sinai but is not seriously ill. &ldquo;It is so awful for new parents, such a tragedy that these babies die,&rdquo; Dr. McGeer said. &ldquo;It's also extremely hard on the staff who work in the unit because every one of those babies is their baby, too.&rdquo; The death of the infant, described as very premature, has prompted special infection-control procedures, including improved hand hygiene and the wearing of gowns and gloves in the 54-bed neonatal intensive care unit, which cares for some of the most fragile babies in the province. Mount Sinai's level 3 neonatal unit, where the most fragile infants are admitted, remained closed last night. Late yesterday afternoon, the hospital reopened level 2 of the neonatal intensive care unit, Dr. McGeer said. Since Monday, there have been three transfers of patients, including pregnant and new mothers, which would have had to happen anyway as the neonatal care unit is at maximum capacity. The baby's death is a tragedy for parents who will mourn a lost future. But it comes at a time when Mount Sinai plans to renovate its neonatal intensive care unit to fix a problem endemic to many Canadian hospitals: too many sick babies in cramped spaces. To minimize infection, experts recommend there be 10 feet between incubators. But hospitals built decades ago, such as Mount Sinai, have only four to five feet between these babies, Dr. McGeer said. Mount Sinai is contemplating whether they should have separate rooms altogether. From an infection-control point of view, experts recommend babies in neonatal intensive care units be in a single room that is 150 square feet and that all babies be 10 feet apart. But that design could potentially spell problems for monitoring them as it could be more difficult to provide treatment to them quickly in an emergency. &ldquo;There's nothing that happened to this baby where mistakes were made or there were obvious problems in care,&rdquo; said Dr. McGeer, adding that Mount Sinai's rate of hospital-acquired infections is very low. &ldquo;Does that mean when we move to single rooms in our new NICU [neonatal intensive care unit] that wouldn't have been one of the deaths that would happen? I can't tell you that. There's really no way of knowing which of those babies is going to be the baby who doesn't die.&rdquo; Though it may sound a rare occurrence, hospital-acquired infections are frighteningly common. They are the fourth-leading cause of death, with 8,000 to 12,000 Canadians dying of them every year, according to Dick Zoutman, physician director of the Community and Hospital Infection Control Association of Canada. &ldquo;People die one at a time,&rdquo; Dr. Zoutman said in a telephone interview from Kingston yesterday, &ldquo;but it's bigger than car accidents, it's bigger than breast cancer, it's bigger than colon cancer. It's huge.&rdquo; Crucial to minimizing serratia infections is hand hygiene, facility design and adequate space, he said. Though serratia is &ldquo;not the most common infection, it is the most feared outbreak in neonatal units,&rdquo; Dr. Zoutman said, adding that when it sweeps through neonatal intensive care units, it can cause pneumonia, meningitis and bacteremia, such as in this most recent case. Treatment is with intravenous antibiotics, which race to stamp out the virulent organism as it travels through the bloodstream. Serratia is known to stimulate an immense immune system reaction: a patient becomes delirious, blood pressure drops and septic shock and organ failure follows. Dr. Zoutman said much more research needs to take place on hospital-acquired infections, and that the federal government should establish a $10-million-a-year research fund for the next 10 years. The problems of hospital-acquired infections are &ldquo;diverse and complex,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we have an abundance of evidence that a lot of it is preventable.&rdquo; Serratia marcescens has a strong history of involvement... I don't think the hospital has determined what caused... My sympathies to the grieving family. No one plans... I agree with dawson. I do not know about Mt Senai,...

Click me to Worse health outcomes for seniors who wait longer for hip surgery: study Anne-Marie Tobin, Canadian Press Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 TORONTO (CP) - Almost two-thirds of seniors who suffer a broken hip go under the knife within a day or two, and they tend to have better outcomes than those who wait longer for an operation, said a report released Wednesday. Overall, the study by the Canadian Institute for Health Information found that nearly 25,000 seniors were admitted to hospital in Canada in 2005-2006 with a broken hip. Hospitalizations for hip fractures were down 13 per cent from five years earlier. But the report found that eight per cent of seniors admitted to hospitals outside Quebec with hip fractures spent four or more days in hospital before having surgery. Those who had to wait longer than the next day for surgery were 22 per cent more likely to die in hospital within 30 days of admission. "We find that there is a group that we could perhaps do a better job on," said Dr. Michael Dunbar, an orthopedic surgeon in Halifax who routinely sees elderly patients showing up in hospital in "significant amounts of pain" after a fall. "We've identified some low-hanging fruit, a group that is waiting and subsequently is not having as good an outcome, particularly with respect to mortality. So it's an area where we could do better." Numerous factors can contribute to delays. Dunbar said they can occur because a patient has to be taken off blood-thinners before surgery, or may require a cardiac assessment first. Jennifer Zelmer, vice-president of research and analysis at CIHI, said the statistics were adjusted for these "patient factors," and the report revealed a number of other concerns related to wait times. "If you were transferred from one hospital to another, or if you're admitted to a larger hospital, or an afternoon or evening admit, or an admission on a weekday as opposed to a weekend, those patients were more likely to have their surgery later than others," said Zelmer, one of the authors of the report. The fact that surgery occurs more quickly when a person is admitted on a weekend might come as a surprise, but Zelmer said it has to do with the fact that someone is specifically on call on the weekend to handle trauma cases and can help a patient immediately. "Whereas on a weekday, they may be in the middle of a hip replacement, for example, or a scheduled surgery," she said. Dunbar agreed, noting that elective surgery isn't normally scheduled on weekends, so surgeons can start working on emergency cases such as fractured hips first thing in the morning. Broken hips are dealt with more quickly in small hospitals, the report found. "Seventy-four per cent, for example, got same day or next day surgery if they were admitted to a small hospital," Zelmer said. The number was 67 per cent for a medium or large community hospital, and 57 per cent for teaching hospitals. As for regional variations, those in Prince Edward Island, British Columbia and Nova Scotia were more likely to have surgery quickly, while patients in Manitoba and Saskatchewan were behind the national average.

Sounds totally sci-fi freaky, doesn&#39;t it? Sadly, it&#39;s dead serious and coming to a milk carton near you! It was one thing to to make them lower in carbohydrates a couple of years back. But what they&#39;re doing to cows just to artificially lower the fat content of their milk takes weird science to a whole new level! We have the New Zealand-based biotechnology company ViaLactia to thank for stumbling across almost by accident a cow they named Marge in 2001 which has a gene mutation allowing it to produce milk with 1% milk naturally rather than the 3.5% milk that traditional cows make for whole milk. This new low-fat milk produced by this one-of-a-kind cow supposedly has more omega-3 fats and the butter created from it is spreadable even when it&#39;s cold. Ooooooh!

But if you're like most, your number is woefully low when it comes to protecting your skin from sun damage and potentially skin cancer. Only 35% of the public scored above average on a recent American Academy of Dermatology national poll, which measured people's sun smarts. In Pictures: How Sun Smart Is Your City? The "Rays: Your Grade" survey polled 3,342 respondents, 50% men and 50% women, in 32 U.S. metropolitan regions covering 29 states during February. Locations were ranked based on residents' answers to 17 questions testing their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding tanning and sun protection. Not surprisingly many of the high-ranking cities-- --feel the warmth of the sun year-round and have strong public awareness campaigns. But despite their more variable climates, topped the list in sun smarts. Dr. Sandra Read, former president of the Washington D.C. Dermatological Society and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Dermatology, said that's because the areas have highly educated and motivated patient populations. "They hear something on NPR while they're driving to my office," Read says, "and they say, 'Tell me about that.' " High-Performance Summer Sporting Gear Worst Cities For Spring Allergies The places at the bottom of the list--those determined to be the least sun savvy--include About 49% of Chicago residents said they believe that given their skin type they don't have to worry about sun exposure, and 59% said they thought getting a base tan is a healthy way to protect skin from sun damage. Neither is true. "My first line of defense is--if you lived in Chicago in our crazy weather, you'd want to be in the sun too," says Dr. Carolyn Jacob of Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology and an associate clinical instructor in dermatology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Chicago is also a city full of young people who think, like many elsewhere, having a tan makes you look good, Jacob says. They just haven't seen the damage it's causing yet. Ask a dermatologist about the mistakes people make when it comes to protecting their skin from the sun and you'll get an earful. No matter where you live, they say, you've probably got some room for improvement. Dr. Joshua Fox, founder and director of Advanced Dermatology and The Center for Laser and Cosmetic Surgery in New York, says even before sunscreen the first step is avoiding the sun, particularly from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Instead of going to the beach at midday, why not wait until the late afternoon? And don't be fooled by talk about how avoiding the sun will lead to a vitamin D deficiency. Most people get more than enough vitamin D through their diets, but if not, a five-minute walk will do the trick, Jacob says. These healthy summer desserts will keep your taste buds happy and your waistline slim. If you are in the sun, wear protective clothing or at least hats and bathing suits with more rather than less coverage. Minnesota-based retailer Coolibar, for instance, sells clothing and with an ultraviolet protection factor of 50+, meaning they protect against ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B waves. To choose the right sunscreen, Dr. Coyle Connolly, president of New Jersey-based medical esthetic clinic Connolly Skin Care, recommends people see a dermatologist, who can suggest the best product for oily, dry or sensitive skin, and your lifestyle. Beyond checking the SPF value, look for a label that promises UVA protection since SPF indicates sun protection only from UVB rays. Good ingredients to look for include avobenzone, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Neutrogena has new products containing Helioplex, a complex that stabilizes avobenzone, which breaks down in sunlight. L'Oreal sells sunscreen made with Mexoryl SX, a filter that's protective against short UVA waves. And a number of sunscreens also now contain antioxidants, which can protect the body from the damaging effect free radicals, a byproduct of exposure to ultraviolet light. Whatever you choose, make sure you're applying a shot glass worth and reapplying about every two hours. Fox says your bottle should not last you the whole summer. People also commonly interpret a higher SPF to indicate more effective sun protection, when it only refers to how much longer you can withstand sun exposure vs. no protection. SPF values don't take into account the fact that you're sweating or wiping off sunscreen with a towel either. Dr. Arielle Kauvar, associate professor of dermatology at the New York University School of Medicine, says people should always wear a minimum of SPF 15 with UVA protection, no matter the climate, since UVA exposure is year-round. UVA rays cause 90% of the changes we identify as signs of aging, such as brown spots, dull and sagging skin, and wrinkles, Kauvar says. If you need a reason to avoid them, tanning salons are known for using beds that emit primarily UVA rays. "We're hoping if people aren't worried about skin cancer," she says, "at least they understand that this sun exposure is what's making them wrinkled." After The Damage Is Done There are steps you can take to care for your skin post-sunbathing. While there's no proof you'll be able to prevent melanoma, you might regenerate your skin's appearance. If your burn is fresh, experts recommend taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen to help with the pain and avoiding sun exposure. Within a day, consider calling your dermatologist to see if it's possible to get a treatment like GentleWaves, which delivers low-intensity light energy to boost collagen and reduce sun damage, fine lines and wrinkles. In less than a minute an $80 to $150 application treats the whole face, says Dr. David McDaniel, director of the Institute of Anti-Aging Research in Virginia Beach, Va. After the fact, creams like can combat wrinkles and sun damaged skin, Jacob says. There are also prescription medications, such as Efudex, that can treat the earliest stages of squamous cell carcinoma, says Kauvar. Deep laser peels and microdermabrasion are other options. The key is to talk to your doctor, and while you're at it, get a skin examination once a year. More than 54% of the adults surveyed by the American Academy of Dermatology said they'd never been screened for skin cancer by a health care provider. And if you keep spending time in the sun, don't be surprised by the results. "If you're swimming with sharks," Connolly says, "you'll get bit every now and then."

Schmidt-Wolf, M.D. Laurence Moore, M.D., Ph.D. Robert J. Motzer, M.D. the Global ARCC Trial Interferon alfa is widely used for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma but has limited efficacy and tolerability. Temsirolimus, a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase, may benefit patients with this disease. In this multicenter, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 626 patients with previously untreated, poor-prognosis metastatic renal-cell carcinoma to receive 25 mg of intravenous temsirolimus weekly, 3 million U of interferon alfa (with an increase to 18 million U) subcutaneously three times weekly, or combination therapy with 15 mg of temsirolimus weekly plus 6 million U of interferon alfa three times weekly. The primary end point was overall survival in comparisons of the temsirolimus group and the combination-therapy group with the interferon group. Patients who received temsirolimus alone had longer overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.92; P=0.008) and progression-free survival Overall survival in the combination-therapy group did not differ significantly from that in the interferon group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.20; P=0.70). Median overall survival times in the interferon group, the temsirolimus group, and the combination-therapy group were 7.3, 10.9, and 8.4 months, respectively. Rash, peripheral edema, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia were more common in the temsirolimus group, whereas asthenia was more common in the interferon group. There were fewer patients with serious adverse events in the temsirolimus group than in the interferon group (P=0.02). As compared with interferon alfa, temsirolimus improved overall survival among patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma and a poor prognosis. The addition of temsirolimus to interferon did not improve survival.

"Using a water pipe to smoke tobacco is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking," the U.N. health agency said in a seven-page document on the practice. "Contrary to ancient lore and popular belief, the smoke that emerges from a water pipe contains numerous toxicants known to cause lung cancer, heart disease and other diseases." The WHO "advisory note" warned using water pipes to consume the tobacco usually exposes a person to more smoke over a longer period of time than do cigarettes. Preliminary research suggests hookah smoking poses many of the same dangers as cigarettes and may involve "some unique health risks," the agency said. A hookah is a bowl connected to a vase of water with a long tube and mouthpiece. The tobacco sits inside the bowl with a layer of foil and a hot coal on top. The tobacco is never lit, instead heated by the charcoal, which smokers say produces a vapor different from smoke. The hookah, used for centuries in North Africa, the Middle East and Central and South Asia, has become increasingly popular in the United States, Europe and Brazil, particularly among college students and young adults. WHO says the trend is partly due to "unfounded assumptions" of its safety, and misleading commercial marketing.

Scientists in New Zealand report they've found a genetic mutation that causes some cows to produce healthier, lower-fat milk. &#40;Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&#41; WELLINGTON, New Zealand May 28, 2007 (AP) New Zealand scientists are breeding a herd of cows that produce lower-fat milk after the chance discovery of a natural gene mutation in one animal. Milk from the cows is also high in health-boosting omega-3 fatty acids and makes butter that spreads as easily as margarine even when chilled, biotechnology company Vialactia said Monday. Heart Attack Relief? The Truth About Omega-3 Omega-3 fatty acids linked to denser bones in men Making Fats Good for You Scientists discovered a cow, later named Marge by researchers, carrying the mutant gene in a dairy herd they were testing in 2001, Vialactia chief scientist Russell Snell said. Vialactia, a subsidiary of the Fonterra Cooperative Group, one of the world's largest milk companies, bought the cow for 300 New Zealand dollars ($218) and moved it to a research site. While she looked like any other Friesian cow, testing revealed that Marge's milk contained about 1 percent fat, compared with about 3.5 percent for whole milk. Offspring from the cow also produce low-fat milk, showing the genetic trait is dominant, Snell said. Scientists have yet to isolate the exact chemical pathway responsible for the naturally produced low-fat milk, Snell said. "Every now and then nature throws up these sorts of things and it was simply a case of us being in the right place at the right time," he said. The company expects the first commercial herd of cows supplying natural low-fat milk and spreadable butter for the market by 2011. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

People exposed to low levels of pesticides had a 13 per cent higher risk of developing the disease, and those exposed to high levels a 41 per cent greater risk, researchers from Aberdeen University found." /> Pesticides increase Parkinson&rsquo;s risk-Life & Style-Health-TimesOnline Our exclusive four-step guide to giving up before the ban Navigation - link to other main sections from here No wonder I'll die alone. All I do is ask questions Pesticides increase Parkinson&rsquo;s risk Nigel Hawkes, Health Editor The risk of developing Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is increased by exposure to pesticides, a study has found. People exposed to low levels of pesticides had a 13 per cent higher risk of developing the disease, and those exposed to high levels a 41 per cent greater risk, researchers from Aberdeen University found. The researchers compared the lifetime experiences of almost 1,000 Parkinson&rsquo;s sufferers with almost 2,000 unaffected people in Scotland, Italy, Sweden, Romania and Malta. The method did not establish which pesticides the sufferers had been exposed to, as most of them could not provide such information. Being knocked out in a boxing ring or suffering an accident that causes unconsciousness is even likelier to bring on Parkinson&rsquo;s. Those who had suffered a single knockout had a 35 per cent greater chance of developing the disease, while those who had been knocked out more than once more than doubled their risk. Country walk made my illness worse The boxer Muhammad Ali, three times heavyweight champion of the world, suffers from Parkinson&rsquo;s syndrome &mdash; a related condition &mdash; which most medical experts believe was caused by his experiences in the ring. The latest study, by the European Commission, aimed to identify factors that can accelerate or cause the disease. The results are published in Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Kieran Breen, director of research and development for the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society, said that the findings reinforced the belief that the disease was caused by more than one factor. He said: &ldquo;The association between pesticides and Parkinson&rsquo;s has been recognised for some time. The results of this study compound the results of a 2006 study of 147,000 people, conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health, which also found the incidence of Parkinson&rsquo;s to be slightly higher in people who reported previous exposure to pesticides.&rdquo; Georgina Downs, of the UK Pesticides Campaign, said that it was not surprising that study after study linked pesticides to chronic neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. &ldquo;This study has found that the risk of developing Parkinson&rsquo;s disease increases according to the level of exposure to pesticides,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is highly significant in relation to the long-term exposure of rural residents living near sprayed fields.&rdquo; She said that it would be difficult to establish which pesticides were responsible as they are rarely used one at a time. The European Commission said last year that long-term exposure to pesticides could lead to serious disturbances to the immune system, as well as sexual disorders and cancers. &mdash; Parkinson&rsquo;s is a progressive brain condition &mdash; Symptoms include tremors, limb rigidity, slow movement and balance and coordination problems &mdash;These are caused by the loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells in the brain &mdash; Parkinson&rsquo;s does not in itself kill, but it can hasten death from other causes I was a cartographic surveyor. I worked mostly outside and in mainly rural areas, more often in farming areas in the northern half of Scotland. I retired in 1996 on a voluntary redundancy scheme at the age of 56. I was diagnosed as having Parkinson's Disease in January 2005, although clearly I had had it for longer. I wonder if I may fall in the category as described by the article on this latest research? John Skipworth, PERTH, Scotland I know a man who has suffered terribly from Parkinsons for about ten years, and he is about 60. Now one of his workmates (they were apprenticed together) has contracted a different form of the illness. They both worked in joinery & construction. Perhaps a solvent could be responsible. G also did some agricultural work, so organo phosphates are another possibility (ie from sheep dip). Surely someone must have collated occupations of people with the illness? Carbon tetrachloride was another well known brain-killer. Tim C, Southern England, so the overwhelming majority of parkinsons sufferers are farmers then? This is very interesting for me as my brother in law died two years ago from parkinson related problems. He was an artist and in particular a stage designer who over a long period of time used solvents to create stage sets as models. Maybe there is a connection between these products and the disease.

On the other hand, waiting to see if the pain goes away on its own won&#39;t affect the outcome of surgery if you decide to have an operation later on, a second study found. Both of the studies, published in the May 31 New England Journal of Medicine , compared surgical treatment of back and leg pain (sciatica) caused by disc herniation or a condition called lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis, which occurs when one vertebra in the back slips forward onto another. "Not all pain -- whether back or sciatic -- can be appropriately managed with surgery, but if it is something that can be helped with surgery, like these two conditions, surgery can provide a more prompt relief of pain and return to function," said Dr. Jeffrey Spivak, director of the New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases Spine Center in New York City. He was not involved in the studies. Another outside expert agreed. Dr. Dante Implicito, chief of spine surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center said that not all people with back pain need surgery. "Many patients are treated conservatively," he said. An accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal pointed out that 75 percent of people with sciatica pain see improvement in their symptoms within three months, even without surgery. However, Implicito pointed out that conservative treatment or a wait-and-see approach isn&#39;t always practical. Some people are in so much pain, they can&#39;t function or may be in danger of losing their jobs if they can&#39;t get back to work, so they opt for surgery sooner rather than later even though they might eventually get better on their own. "These studies show that there can be tremendous improvement if patients are selected well for surgery," he said. The first study, done in the Netherlands, included 283 people who had severe sciatica -- leg pain caused by a compressed nerve in the spine -- for at least six to 12 weeks prior to the start of the study. Half of the group was selected to undergo early surgery -- an average of 2.2 weeks into the study; while the other half was chosen to receive conservative treatment with the option of surgery at a later date. Thirty-nine percent of the conservative treatment group eventually decided to have surgery, and the average time from the start of the study to the surgery was 18.7 weeks. The researchers found there wasn&#39;t much difference in disability between the two groups, but that those who had early surgery reported faster pain relief than the conservative treatment group. "The time scheme of recovering was different, with a faster recovery after early surgery," said the study&#39;s lead author, Dr. Wilco Peul, a neurosurgeon at Leiden University Medical Center. "Fifty percent of patients [in the early surgery group] were recovered in 4 weeks after randomization, whereas prolonged conservative care would need 12 weeks before 50 percent were recovered." "I would recommend to wait a little longer and delay the decision to perform surgery until three to six months after the start of leg pain. If, however, sciatica pain does not allow you to work or care for yourself or your family, early surgery remains a very good option and is safe," said Peul. The second study included a little more than 600 people with degenerative spondylolisthesis, a condition more common in older people, and for reasons that aren&#39;t clear, black women. Half of the patients were randomly selected to undergo surgery, the majority of whom had spinal fusion, a procedure in which two vertebra are fused together. The other half was to receive standard non-surgical care. However, many in the non-surgical group decided to have surgery, so the researchers had to adjust the study data, because the results were no longer randomized. They found that after three months, and again at one year, people who had the surgical procedure had less pain and a greater improvement in function than those who didn&#39;t have surgery. "These studies allow us to make better conclusions about the treatment options available for patients," said Spivak. "Surgery is not the end answer for all pain problems, especially back pain. There have to be specific reasons to operate. In my practice, of all the surgical referrals I see, only about one in three end up getting surgery," Spivak said. But, for those with disc herniation or spondylolisthesis, these studies confirm that surgery can be an effective alternative, and that even if you wait to have surgery, "you wouldn&#39;t have lost anything in terms of your chances of doing well," he said. Implicito emphasized that the most important thing someone with back pain can do is see a specialist with as much specific training in back problems as possible. "Back pain comes in a lot of different &#39;flavors&#39;, you need to be evaluated and diagnosed by a very well-trained person so you know what&#39;s relevant to your condition."

World observes No Tobacco Day Washington, May 31: Tobacco is the second major cause of deaths worldwide. Half of the people who smoke regularly today – about 650 million – will eventually die of tobacco-related diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 700 million children, or almost half of the world’s children, breathe air that is polluted by tobacco smoke, particularly in their homes. The International Labor Organization (ILO) says that at least 200,000 workers die every year due to exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. There is no known safe level of human exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, which causes cancer as well as serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in children and adults that lead to death. This year’s World No Tobacco Day focuses on 100 percent Smoke-Free Environments as the only measure to protect people, especially women and children, and people in the workplace, from exposure to second hand tobacco smoke. Health experts stress that neither ventilation nor filtration – alone or in combination – can reduce exposure to tobacco smoke indoors to levels that are considered safe or acceptable. World No Tobacco Day is observed around the world on May 31 each year. In 1987, the World Health Assembly – the supreme decision-making body of the WHO – passed a resolution calling for April 7, 1988, to be "a world no smoking day." In 1988, another resolution was passed designating May 31 every year as World No Tobacco Day. As we observe World No Tobacco Day this year, we draw public attention to the "tobacco epidemic" and the preventable diseases and deaths it causes, and to the campaign to help reduce the millions of preventable deaths from tobacco-related health illnesses by campaigning for a smoke-free environment in our homes, communities, schools, and workplaces. The right to clean air – free from tobacco smoke – is a human right; most people are non-smokers and have the right not to be exposed to other people’s smoke. Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your (and other people’s) health. Quit smoking and live longer. *Your friend's e-mail address: How the brain hears shapes?

In a new drive against obesity, the EU's top public health official Markos Kyprianou unveiled a new fat-fighting strategy paper in Brussels on Wednesday. To the experts, it may not go far enough. The emphasis is firmly on self-regulation, with Kyprianou "encouraging" food companies to provide consumers with full information about the health risks associated with their products. He also urged the food industry to cut down on sugar, fat and salt, and said sports organizations should do more to get youngsters to engage in physical exercise. Ideally, he said he hoped the industry would act voluntarily, but stressed that a review in 2010 would decide whether new laws were needed. Without increased information available to consumers, he said, the possibility of setting tougher advertising and labeling rules on companies could not be ruled out. "What consumers eat is up to them, but they should be able to make informed choices, and have a range of healthy options to choose from," said the EU Health Commissioner. "That is why the Commission is reviewing the options for nutrition labeling, and calling on industry to advertise responsibly and reduce levels of salt, fats and sugar in food products." Piling on the pounds Getting the kids away from the computers and on to the beach The anti-obesity push comes in response to growing evidence that Europeans are getting fatter. Over half are now estimated to be obese or overweight. According to the World Health Organization, obesity rates have more than trebled since the 1980s in many European countries, with children particularly at risk. Over 21 million are now classified as obese. "We have to acknowledge the fact that children don't entertain themselves any more through physical activity," he said, adding that they needed to be "reintroduced" to sport. "If we don't act, today's overweight children will be tomorrow's heart attack victims," said Kyprianou, who also pointed out that diets based on fatty and sweet ingredients combined with lack of physical activity account for six of the seven top factors leading to poor health. "The numbers are frightening," he stressed. Gro&szlig;ansicht des Bildes mit der Bildunterschrift: Will Europe really change its eating habits? The EU Commission has long been telling governments to act, but the statistics show the warnings have been in vain. "Everybody has to be blamed -- including the authorities, including the industry, including the consumers," Kyprianou said. Overall, consumption of fruit and vegetables in the EU is lower than medical recommendations. The intake of fat and saturated fats is high throughout the continent, while the consumption of cereals has fallen by a quarter since the 1960s in Europe. Amounting to 7 percent of the total EU budget for healthcare, the cost of obesity could also do with shedding some weight. But without tough legislation, many believe the obesity problem will continue to balloon. European consumer organization BEUC were among those expressing disappointment with Brussels' plans. "Like many slimming regimes, the white paper is built on false hopes and unrealistic expectations," said BEUC chief Jim Murray.

T.O. neonatal unit shut after infection kills baby Updated Thu. May. 31 2007 9:06 AM ET The neonatal intensive care unit at a downtown Toronto hospital has been shut down after a premature baby died from a highly feared bacterial infection, according to a newspaper report. The infant died of bacteremia, commonly known as blood poisoning, at Mount Sinai Hospital, said the hospital's director of infection control Dr. Allison McGeer. She said the blood poisoning occurred after the baby acquired serratia, a harmful pathogen that can cause severe infections in babies. "This is one of the organisms we really worry about it," McGeer told The Globe and Mail. "... This is not an organism you take any chances with." The infant, weighing between one and three pounds, died over the weekend. "It is so awful for new parents, such a tragedy that these babies die," said McGeer. "It's also extremely hard on the staff who work in the unit because every one of those babies is their baby, too." A second baby also tested positive for serratia, which can lead to pneumonia, meningitis and bacteremia infections. The infant is in isolation at the hospital but is not seriously ill. The death has prompted the hospital to impose special infection control procedures, including improved hand hygiene and mandatory gowns and gloves in the neonatal intensive care unit. The hospital's level 3 neonatal unit remained closed Wednesday night but level 2 was reopened on Wednesday afternoon. The neonatal ward is currently operating at maximum capacity and the hospital has plans to expand the space in order to prevent sick infants from being in close proximity. To minimize infection, experts recommend incubators be placed at least 10 feet apart. The Mount Sinai incubators are currently placed four to five feet apart. According to Dick Zoutman, physician director of the Community and Hospital Infection Control Association of Canada, hospital-acquired infections are the fourth leading cause of death among patients. Zoutman told the newspaper between 8,000 and 12,000 Canadians die from hospital-acquired infections every year.

Dutch couple may have injected dozens with HIV more articles by Gus Cairns Four HIV positive men from Groeningen province in the north of the Netherlands, in a sensational case, have confessed to the police that they held sex parties where they drugged men with GHB and injected them with their own blood in an attempt to infect them. Dutch HIV workers told Gay.com that they were aware that at least 10 men who attended the sex parties had contracted HIV – which implies that considerably more men were victims of the assaults. The accused are two 48-year old men from Slochteren and two men from Groeningen aged 33 and 34. Two have confessed to the sexual assault and deliberate infection attempts: the other two have so far only admitted to dealing in huge quantities of GHB. One does not define as gay. Five victims between the ages of 25 and 50 have reported to the police so far and four of them have filed charges. The Dutch public prosecutor has charged the men with premeditated grievous bodily harm, but said it could not charge them with attempted murder or manslaughter because “the life expectancy of the victims can be extended with medication.” The offence carries a maximum penalty of 16 years in prison. Gay.com spoke to Robert Witlox, Director of the Dutch HIV Association, who takes up the story. “We became aware that something odd was going on in Groeningen about a year ago. Someone came to a support group for people newly diagnosed with HIV and gave us this story about having been drugged unconscious with GHB and raped, which was how he got the virus. “At first we dismissed it – you hear many such stories in support groups – but several other people came forward with similar stories. One said he had come to to find a man still fucking him without a condom while another said that during the experience he had felt a sharp needle-like pain in his anus.” The suspects have confessed that they took syringes of blood missed from all four of them and injected them into their victims’ anuses. Witlox continues: “The men would advertise small sex parties – 3-5 people - on the internet. It appears they were doing it on a frequent basis, and it continued right up till they were arrested in May. “We alerted the public health department in Groeningen who said they had heard similar stories. They put out a press release warning gay men warning gay men about attending sex parties and saying they had noticed a rise in local HIV infections. “We finally persuaded the first victim – who does not publicly identify as gay – to make a formal complaint to the police in January.” Witlox commented that one of the features of the case was that the victims appeared largely to be non-gay-identified men seeking bisexual thrills on the internet. The two who have made confessions to the police said that they were motivated by lust and because if they made other men positive they’d have the opportunity to have unprotected sex with them. Witlox comments: “In many ways this is a straightforward case. The legal argument about HIV transmission has always been about reckless infection,” (i.e. not meaning to infect, but not caring either), “whereas this is a clear case of rape and of attempted deliberate infection. Judging by the confessions, the accused must have had psychiatric problems around having HIV. “In talking to the media yesterday, not just myself but also representatives from the Dutch Health Ministry said that this behaviour was not typical of gay men or people with HIV.” Witlox added, however, that since then his organisation has been accused of fostering a culture of normalising unsafe sex. “Journalists are now linking the case with the fact that we have a support group called Positive and Proud where subjects like serosorting” (i.e. consensual unprotected sex between HIV positive people) “are discussed. We’ve been asked if we have any norms. “We’ve said: ‘Yes, we do; we’re saying it’s not alright to rape people and deliberately infect them with HIV!’” Image courtesy of the excellent &copy;1995-2007 PLANETOUT INC.

Anne Kyle, Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post Published:Â Thursday, May 31, 2007 REGINA -- Saskatchewan has the second-highest hip fracture hospitalization rates in the country, and according to a new study those patients have some of the longest waits for surgery. The proportion of hip fracture patients in Saskatchewan who had surgery on the same day or the day after admission to hospital, at 56 per cent, is the secondlowest in Canada, behind Manitoba, the Canadian Institute of Health Information's (CIHI) Health Indicators 2007 report noted. The availability of hospital beds and the time it takes to stabilize and transfer patients between hospitals contribute to the longer waits for service, said Deborah Jordan, Saskatchewan Health's executive director of the acute and emergency services branch. Email to a friend "When you consider in Saskatchewan that hip fractures would most typically be repaired by orthopedic surgeons, there are really only four centres in Saskatchewan that have that capacity," Jordan said. While national hospitalization rates for hip fractures are down 13 per cent from fi ve years ago, 70 seniors a day were admitted to Canadian hospitals with broken hips in 2005-06, according to the CIHI report which was released on Wednesday. Saskatchewan averaged 600 hip fracture hospitalizations per 100,000 population compared to the Canadian average of 502 per 100,000. Saskatchewan is about average compared to the rest of Canada (0.8 per 1,000 population) in in-hospital hip fractures; however, Saskatoon has a higher than average inhospital hip fracture rate at 1.3 per 1,000 population. The CIHI report also found that in 2005-06 almost two-thirds of seniors who broke their hips got surgery by the second day of admission to hospital in Canada. But eight per cent of Canadian seniors with broken hips, about 1,400 patients, lie languishing in a hospital bed for four or more days awaiting surgery. "This is important new information, because evidence suggests that hip fracture patients who have surgery sooner tend to have better health outcomes," Jennifer Zelmer, CIHI's vice-president of research and analysis, said in a prepared statement. The report provides a starting point for the province, which is working with the Saskatchewan Surgical Care Network to meet the pan-Canadian benchmark, which is providing surgery within 48 hours of the time the patient is ready to treat, she said. The CIHI report noted that of the 17,000 seniors who underwent surgery to repair broken hips in hospitals outside of Quebec, 1,000 died in hospital within a month of admission. The study ties longer waits for hip surgery with higher death rates and longer, often more painful, recovery in hospital. The death rate for patients who waited longer for surgery was 22 per cent higher than for those treated on the day of admission to hospital or the next day. "Certainly the goal of ensuring that people get more timely care for hip fracture is to try and prevent any of the other complications that might ensue with the wait," Jordan said. While good progress is being made in the treatment of broken hips, more emphasis needs to be placed on helping to prevent falls, which are one of the leading causes of hip fractures among seniors, she said.

Though many scientists have cautioned that it's too soon to link cancers to toxins at the site, doctors at Mount Sinai's World Trade Center medical monitoring program are now seeing surprising cases of plasma-cell cancers in people who were there, said Dr. Robin Herbert. "We know we have a handful of cases of multiple myeloma in very young individuals, and multiple myeloma is a condition that almost always presents later in life, so that's the kind of odd, unusual and troubling finding that we're seeing already," Herbert said in an online audio interview in advance of today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Doctors at Mount Sinai are trying to verify cases of leukemia and lymphoma reported by any of the more than 20,000 responders they've examined, she said. More than 120 people with those cancers are part of a class-action lawsuit alleging negligence by the city and its contractors at Ground Zero, said lawyer David Worby. "People are afraid of the C-word, cancer. It's taken hundreds of people getting sick this way for Mount Sinai to say, 'We are more than concerned,'" Worby said. "Washington and Mount Sinai should draw up an entire platform of blood tests and precancer tests." Herbert was unavailable for an interview, but in the Journal she described three waves of post-9/11 illnesses. The first was the stubborn, dry "World Trade Center cough" stemming from pulverized cement there and seen in the months just after the disaster. The second wave involves chronic respiratory diseases that cause lung inflammation and scarring. Cancers could be the third wave among responders exposed to asbestos, dioxins and other carcinogens at Ground Zero, Herbert said. Although the "full range" of those toxins will never be known, "you really worry when you have a mix of chemicals about the possibility of [a] synergistic effect," she said.

Sixty healthy postmenopausal women were randomized in a crossover design to a TLC diet including 25 g/d of non-soy protein, or a TLC diet of similar energy, fat, and protein content in which soy nuts (containing 25 g/d of soy protein and 101 mg of aglycone isoflavones) replaced non-soy protein. Compared to the non-soy TLC diet, the TLC diet with soy nuts lowered systolic and diastolic BP 9.9 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively, in hypertensive women, and 5.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, in normotensive women. Further, BPs of normotensive women were lowered 5.5 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, in prehypertensive women, and 4.5 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively, in normotensive women. Soy nut supplementation lowered LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels 11 percent and 8 percent, respectively, in hypertensive women, but had no effect in normotensive women. These data further support the cardioprotective effects of soy. LycoRed: Providing Innovative Solutions for Cutting-Edge Development to see what the buzz was about at Supply Side East.

Parents and schools, major factors in China obesity boom Buy best Obesity products from Amazon Obesity :: Parents and schools, major factors in China obesity boom Childhood obesity is widely recognised as a major contributor towards cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, sleep disorders, and psychological and social problems. The China National Nutrition and Health survey in 2002 revealed that the prevalence of overweight individuals has increased overall by 39% in the past ten years. In Xi'an City, where the new study was conducted, 20% of the adolescents were found to be overweight, a rate similar to that observed in many western countries. In a recent report in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers found the following factors were significantly associated with overweight and obesity in children included:living in urban districtslimited use of sports facilities in schoolswealthier householdshaving an obese/overweight parenthaving soft drink >4 times a week and not being fussy about foods. Co-author of the research, Dr Ming Li, Research Fellow, at The George Institute for International Health in Sydney, explained that these risk factors should guide the future development of evidence-based and cost-effective strategies to tackle this increasing public health problem in China. Dr Li said that "Predictors of excess weight and obesity are widely acknowledged as heredity, lifestyle and environmental factors. However, these factors need to be viewed more closely, as they are greatly influenced by parents in a family, teachers at school, which are embedded in a community, and social context." "Strategies that target socio-economic and behavioural factors alone do not seem to be effective in the long-term and are simply not sufficient. A stronger focus on community, school and household environments is vital to reduce the growing obesity epidemic. This is particularly important for a society that is undergoing such a massive nutritional transition," she noted. The published research recommends that obesity intervention programs should include:coordinated government policy-making for infrastructure development and food supply;involvement of schools in the development of curriculum and school policies; andfamily involvement, with a parenting approach that fosters a healthy lifestyle for children at the early stage of their life, to benefit them for the whole of their life. Dr Li highlights the associated factors at the school level, such as the hours spent in class versus physical activity: "Chinese students spend around 8-9 hours a day at school. Obesity prevention strategies should really include the need to adjust school curricula to increase the opportunity for physical activity during the school day. Limited use of school sports facilities increased the risk of obesity by 70%." "In addition, adolescents were more likely to be overweight or obese in urban and suburban areas, due to increased passive transport to school, easy access to fast food and also students in these areas are more likely to spend more time doing homework and have less physical activity." Dr Li added. Parental control of "snacking" was reported to be strongly associated with adolescent obesity, especially in boys. "Parent's expression of nurturing emotion with clear communication and realistic behavioural expectations is imperative in a child's development and healthy behaviour. It provides motivation for the child, allows the parents to help establish healthy behaviours and reinforces self-regulation, thereby allowing the child to develop new and healthy activities," Dr Li noted. Unlike findings from western countries, higher parental education was associated with overweight and obesity in adolescents. Eating and exercise behaviours can be shaped and cultivated by good family habits based on the parents' knowledge and practice.

The research was done at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Francine K. Welty led the study and put 60 healthy post-menopausal women to the test with the soy nuts. They had them eat two diets for eight weeks each. One diet had soy nuts, the other protein. The researchers found that those who ate the soy nuts had a lower blood pressure as well a cholesterol level. It lowered blood pressure by about 10%. Cholesterol was also lowered by about 11%. The conclusion by the researchers was that &#8220;This study was performed in the free-living state; therefore, dietary soy may be a practical, safe and inexpensive modality to reduce blood pressure. If the findings are repeated in a larger group they may have important implications for reducing cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women on a population basis.&#8221; Cocoa Lowers Blood Pressure Better Than Tea Chocolate Helps Lower Blood Pressure Study: Cocoa May Lower Blood Pressure High Blood Pressured Caused By Brain Painkillers Cause High Blood Pressure instead of Internet Explorer and PREVENT Spyware! and is considered the best free, safe web browser E Canada Now - Breaking News Copyright 2006-2007 Dedicated Servers by FastServers.net Other Sections Of eCanadaNow

Jump to main content Space telescope spies dark matter United Nations' AIDS programme under fire Static holes defy theory Deadly TB strain flies around the world Silicon crystal cooked to perfection Published online: 30 May 2007; | doi:10.1038/news070528-6 United Nations' AIDS programme under fire Authors accuse agency of putting politics before health. The growth of better-funded projects has triggered an identity crisis at UNAIDS. Two new books are forcing the United Nations' AIDS programme to defend itself against claims that politics have distorted its mission. In one, Berkeley epidemiologist James Chin argues that the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has overestimated the potential size of the AIDS pandemic. That way, Chin says, the agency can claim credit when actual infection rates are lower than the projections. In the second, writer Helen Epstein says that UNAIDS has dodged the issue of sexual behaviour in Africa. Although reducing number of sexual partners can slow the spread of HIV, Epstein says UNAIDS has shied away from this message for political and cultural reasons. Some praise the books for providing much-needed scrutiny of UNAIDS. In a book review published today in , Stephen Lewis, former UN special envoy for AIDS in Africa, calls them "liberating" (see ' Time for a change? And the University of Ottawa's Amir Attaran says the United Nations has a general problem with book-keeping. The United Nations has set a series of targets called the Millennium Development Goals, which call for improvements such as reducing HIV infection, child mortality and poverty by 2015. But Attaran alleges the United Nations has failed to properly measure progress towards these goals, rendering them all but meaningless. "It's got to be the greatest swindle in all of development," Attaran says. Other observers defend UNAIDS against the claim of distorting data. The crux of Chin's argument is that UNAIDS epidemiologists have erred by surveying pregnant women for HIV infection at prenatal clinics, then extrapolating to the general population. More recent surveys of HIV in the general population have prompted UNAIDS to lower its estimates in some African and Asian countries. But those who participate in the process say this was never about politics, but more about adapting calculations to the available data. And, they add, UNAIDS has always said that data from different methods aren't directly comparable. "It has always been a data-based, not a political process," says Tim Brown, an epidemiologist at the East-West Center in Honolulu who collaborates with UNAIDS. "The epidemiology team at UNAIDS has gone out of its way to stress that data can only be interpreted in terms of trends based on the same methodology," he says. UNAIDS also says that it has long emphasized the value of reducing the number of sexual partners, including in a 2005 document, "Intensifying HIV Prevention". Some observers support the claim. "As far as I am aware, reducing partner numbers has been a prevention message for the past 20 years," says Geoff Garnett at Imperial College London, which coordinates the UNAIDS Epidemiology Reference Group. The broader picture behind the criticisms is that UNAIDS is searching for relevance. The agency was formed a decade ago to focus attention on the disease when there was little international funding or political commitment to fight it. Now, huge entities such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) are pouring unprecedented resources into the problem. Leadership has largely shifted to these bodies and away from UNAIDS, which is hampered by bureaucratic constraints and a smaller budget. That makes UNAIDS a relatively soft target, some say. "UNAIDS is easy to shoot at, because they don't have a lot of money compared with donors such as PEPFAR and the Global Fund," says Chris Beyrer, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. "What are they supposed to do? They're not an enormously powerful entity." But that begs the question of what to expect from UNAIDS in the future. With little money and clout, the agency must find a way to deal with its identity crisis. Additional reporting by Emma Marris to read and post comments about this story.

USA TODAY On Politics Democrats duel over health care By Jill Lawrence, USA TODAY WASHINGTON &#151; A health care overhaul proposed Tuesday by Illinois Sen. Barack Obama underscores the central role the issue is playing in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Obama, New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and former North Carolina senator John Edwards have laid out plans to expand and modernize U.S. health care, while New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has suggested ways to build on existing coverage. There is no comparable intramural competition on the Republican side. Candidate calls for universal health care The Democrats' offerings are "a big tactical change" from 2004, says Ken Thorpe, head of the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta. Those proposals, he says, were "very incremental." Like Edwards, Obama would require that all children be covered and all businesses either offer health benefits or help pay for them. However, Obama does not require individuals to buy coverage. Such a mandate, similar to laws saying people must buy car insurance, is central to the plan Edwards unveiled in February. Some policy analysts say it's crucial to achieving universal coverage. "You can't get to covering everyone without some sort of requirement," says Chris Jennings, a former Clinton administration health aide who is now an unpaid adviser to Hillary Clinton. Her policy director, Neera Tanden, meanwhile, called Obama's program "incentives" and said "in addition to making health care more accessible, we have to achieve true universal health care." Obama said Tuesday in Iowa City that the nation can achieve universal coverage "with the health care plan I'm outlining today." Spokesman Dan Pfeiffer said Obama expects the plan to cover everyone but will do "whatever turns out to be necessary" if it is implemented and that is not the case. Clinton last week discussed how she would make health care less expensive and said she would address quality and coverage in later speeches. In the Senate, she is trying to expand children's health insurance. The complex reform plan Clinton oversaw in 1993-94 when she was first lady did not require people to buy coverage. Now, however, that mandate is part of a Massachusetts law signed last year by then-governor Mitt Romney, now a Republican presidential candidate. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, also a Republican, is pushing a similar idea. So far there is no health focus by Romney or other GOP presidential candidates, reflecting the priorities of Republican voters. In a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll in January, 59% of Democrats but only 40% of Republicans said it was "extremely important" that the president and Congress deal with health care. Obama says his plan would save "typical" families up to $2,500 a year; Clinton says hers would save up to $2,200. The Obama campaign said the difference is Obama would reimburse businesses for some of the costs of catastrophic-illness coverage on the condition the money be used to lower workers' premiums. Obama says his plan would cost the federal government $50 billion to $65 billion, after savings from such steps as better preventive care, better management of chronic diseases, negotiating lower drug prices and a transition to electronic patient records and other technology. He would spend $10 billion a year for five years on technology upgrades. Clinton has outlined similar ways to reduce costs. She would devote $3 billion a year to the high-tech transition and require all insurance companies that do business with the government to cover preventive care. She also proposes a "Best Practices Institute" to study what works best. There is no overall cost estimate for her plan because she hasn't announced all the details yet. The Edwards plan would cost $90 billion to $120 billion a year. Noteworthy aspects include its mandate and, for those who don't have insurance through their jobs, a choice of private plans or a government plan modeled on Medicare. Edwards and Obama would end some tax cuts for well-off Americans to offset the cost of their health care programs. Edwards has not offered as much detail as Obama or Clinton on cutting health care costs. Thorpe, who analyzed some health care numbers for Obama and Edwards, says Edwards "could probably get to the same (price) range" as Obama by backing similar cost-cutting measures &#8212; but "he'd have to add a whole new piece to his proposal" to lay them out. Edwards spokesman Eric Schultz said Edwards "has an aggressive plan" to cut costs. To report corrections and clarifications, contact Reader Editor By Charlie Neibergall, AP Democratic Sen.

May. 30 2007 10:54 AM ET Most Canadian seniors who break their hips are able to get surgery on the same day, or the day after, they are admitted to hospital. But eight per cent have to wait four days or longer, putting them at risk of complications and even death. The Canadian Institute for Health Information, in its annual Health Indicators 2007 report, says that in 2005-2006 about 17,000 surgeries were performed in Canada to repair hip fractures on patients aged 65 and older, in hospitals outside of Quebec. About six per cent of these patients, about 1,000, died in hospital within 30 days of admission. CIHI found that the mortality risk for patients who waited four days or longer for surgery was 22 per cent higher than for those treated on the day of admission to hospital or the next day. The results were calculated after accounting for other factors that affect mortality, such as age and other health problems. "Hip fractures represent a tremendous health burden for seniors. Recovery is often slow and painful, and many patients experience a loss of mobility and other health problems," says Dr. Michael Dunbar, associate professor of Orthopedic Surgery at Dalhousie University. Research has shown that hip fracture patients who have surgery to repair a broken hip sooner tend to have better health outcomes. Those who wait longer are more likely to have longer stays in hospital and often have more difficulty recovering. CIHI's report found that patients who underwent hip fracture surgery on the day they were admitted to hospital or the next day spent an average of 18.5 days in hospital after surgery. Those who waited longer spent an average of 20.5 days in hospital after surgery. How quickly patients are able to receive surgery for hip fracture surgery varies across the country, CIHI said. In 2005-2006, patients were more likely than the overall average (65 per cent) to have surgery on the day of admission or the next day in Prince Edward Island (78 per cent); British Columbia (71 per cent); and Nova Scotia (69 per cent). Patients in Manitoba (53 per cent) and Saskatchewan (56 per cent) were less likely to do so. Patients are less likely to have surgery on the day of admission or the next day if they have to be transferred to another hospital for care; if they are admitted to a larger community or teaching hospital; if they are admitted in the afternoon or evening; or if they are admitted on a weekday. The primary risk factors for hip fractures are osteoporosis, low physical activity, multiple medication use, as well as a senior's physical surroundings, says Greg Webster, CIHI's director of research and indicator development.

Agus, MD; Emeritus Professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Additional Parkinson's Disease Coverage ABERDEEN, Scotland, May 30 -- People with a family history of Parkinson's disease may be more susceptible to it after pesticide exposure or repeated blows to the head, European investigators reported. Explain to patients that pesticide exposure has been linked to neurological disorders and other diseases, and that precautions should always be taken when using toxic chemicals. Explain that even a single blow to the head causing loss of consciousness may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Also explain that this type of study can document associations but cannot determine causality and is subject to unrecognized residual confounding. In a case-control study of nearly 1,000 patients with Parksinon's disease or parkinsonism and almost 2,000 controls, high exposure to pesticides increased the risk of the disease by 41%, according to Finlay Dick, M.D., of the University of Aberdeen here, and colleagues. A history of traumatic head blows causing a loss of consciousness, an occupational hazard of boxing and other sports, was associated with a 2.5-fold greater risk, the authors reported in Occupational and Environmental Medicine specialty journal, in an early online release. "It seems likely that Parkinson's disease is not a single disease but a number of phenotypically similar illnesses," the investigators wrote. "A variable range of genetic and environmental interactions may produce these conditions and it may be that any individual risk factor will only affect susceptible subjects." Occupational and environmental risk factors implicated in Parkinson's and other movement disorders include exposure to pesticides, solvents, and metals, the authors noted, but just which toxins are at fault, and what level of exposure is required, is unclear. "The current evidence for occupational risk factors for Parkinson's disease has several weaknesses," they wrote. "Many studies of occupational exposures have had small sample sizes. There have been few studies of occupational exposures to solvents or metals. The exposure estimates employed in some studies have been relatively crude, sometimes as simple as exposed or job title classifications. It is known that such exposure surrogates may lead to misclassification of exposure." The authors' case-control study was conducted with patients in Scotland, Sweden, Italy, Romania, and Malta. They enrolled 959 patients with prevalent parkinsonism, 767 of whom had a diagnosis of Parkinson's according to the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria. Patients with drug-induced parkinsonism, vascular parkinsoism, or dementia were excluded. The patients were matched by age and gender with 1,989 controls from a variety of clinical and community settings. Trained interviewers administered to participants a questionnaire about lifetime occupational and hobby exposure to solvents, pesticides, iron, copper, and manganese. Investigators blinded to disease status estimated lifetime and average annual exposures using a job-exposure matrix modified by subjective exposure modeling. The subjective exposure modeling takes into consideration factors such as ventilation, methods of chemical application, and whether the worker used protective measures. The investigators created multiple logistic regression models to analyze results, controlling for age, gender, country, tobacco use, ever knocked unconscious, and family history of Parkinson's disease. They found that compared with patients with no exposure, the odds ratio for low pesticide exposure and Parkinson's-parkinsonism was not significant, at 1.13 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.57) but high pesticide exposure was significantly associated with risk (odds ratio 1.41, 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.88). In addition, they found that being knocked unconscious even once carried a significant risk for Parkinson's compared with never being knocked unconscious (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.68). Patients who had been knocked out more than once vs. never had an odds ratio for Parkinson's or parkinsonism of 2.53, (95% CI 1.78 to 3.59). Hypnotic, anxiolytic or antidepressant drug use for more than one year were associated with odds ratios ranging from 1.33 to 1.92 for Parkinson's, and a family history of the disease in a first-degree relative was associated with a nearly five-fold risk (odds ratio 4.85, 95% CI, 3.43 to 6.86). As other studies have suggested, tobacco use was protective (odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI, .40 to 0.58), but alcohol was not (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.15). When the authors restricted their analyses to the 767 patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, the results were similar, they noted. "This study has provided important evidence of the increased risk of Parkinson's disease in relation to exposure to pesticides. The exposure-response relationship suggests that pesticide exposure may be a causative and potentially modifiable risk factor," the investigators wrote. They noted that their results may be limited by recall bias and by an underestimation of pesticide exposure because of the seasonal nature of pesticides use. They also pointed out that "no information as to the timing of head injury, or use of medication was sought and accordingly we cannot state that these exposures predate symptom onset. Thus, the observed association with head injury may be due to recall bias or to an increased risk of falls in Parkinson's disease. Equally, the use of psychotropic medication may simply reflect the well recognized psychiatric effects of Parkinson's disease." This study was underwritten by the European Union.

AMO Lens Solution Recall: Stock Drops, Outbreak Still a Mystery May 30, 2007. By Gordon Gibb Upon news Friday of the Advanced Medical Optics voluntary recall of , stock in the company fell sharply, dropping in value by nearly 14 per cent. What's more, company officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta still have no idea what caused the outbreak of Acanthamoeba involving 138 users of AMO's Complete MoisturePlus lens solution. The parasite is far more common than that which caused the Fusarium fungal infections linked to a Bausch and Lomb product last year, and rarely infects the eye. But Acanthamoeba packs a powerful punch when it does, and is difficult to treat. The impact is quite serious. Dr. Robert Cykiert, a leading ophthalmologist at the New York University Medical Center and a clinical associate professor at the NYU School of Medicine, was quoted in the New York Times this morning as saying that up to half of those acquiring the Acanthamoeba infection will require corneal transplants, vs. 30 per cent of those suffering a Fusarium fungal infection. While the cause may still be a mystery, the manufacturer and the CDC in Atlanta are advising users of AMO Complete MoisturePlus to dispose of any unused bottles of the product, the lens cases and even the lenses themselves. It is projected that close to two million Americans could be at risk, based on Advanced Medical Optic's market share of the thirty million wearers of contact lenses in the U.S. On Friday of last week, Advanced Medical Optics announced a voluntary recall of its Complete MoisturePlus Lens solution after the CDC in Atlanta linked 138 cases of Acanthamoeba infection to the product. The recall came the same day as the CDC advised the company about is' preliminary study of Acanthamoeba victims since early 2005 showed that users of AMO Complete MoisturePlus were found to be seven times more likely to suffer an infection. Ironically, the day before the recall, Advanced Medical announced its' interest in pursuing the purchase of eye care products maker Bausch and Lomb, the company that was hit with the Fusarium fungal recall last year over its' ReNu with MoistureLoc solution. The takeover bid for control of B&L, a much larger company than Advanced Medical, is on hold for now while AMO focuses on managing the recall, and determining the origins of the outbreak. They've been down this road before To the manufacturer's credit, Advanced Medical reacted swiftly once it was advised of the CDC's findings - unlike rival Basuch and Lomb, which was accused of dragging its heels for weeks over the ReNu Fusarium Keratitis infections of 2006. Still, there have been problems in the past for AMO. In November, Advanced Medical recalled 2.9 million packets of its Complete MoisturePlus and Active Packs after three lots in Japan were found to have bacterial contamination. Of those, 183,000 units were sold in the United States. At the time, the company blamed the contamination on a water-borne organism that somehow managed to creep into the solution at the AMO plant in...wait for it.... China (Menu Foods, tainted tooth paste). That sterility issue has since been resolved, the company says, but there remains a question mark for anyone with concerns about where the products introduced into one of the most vulnerable areas of the body, are made. While it has not been disclosed just where the AMO Complete MoisturePlus solution was made, it has been reported that Advanced Medical's manufacturing facility located in Alcobendas, Spain is the primary supplier for the U.S. and European markets. Contact lens users who experience symptoms of an eye infection such as redness, pain, tearing, increased light sensitivity, blurred vision, discharge or swelling, should remove their lenses and consult their eye care provider immediately. Doctors have begun fielding what is expected to be a flood of calls from concerned users. The sleuthing into the cause of the outbreak - and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention DOES use the 'O-word' - continues. Meantime, Advanced Medical Optics reported year-end sales of U.S. $997.5 million for 2006, and adjusted projections for 2007 - following the 2006 recall - were for revenue in the range of $1.06 to $1.08 billion dollars. The company will no doubt have to revise those projections downward. The last major outbreak of Acanthamoeba was in the early 1980's.

The drug, known chemically as temsirolimus, is the third such therapy approved since late 2005 for the disease -- the most common form of kidney cancer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. In December 2005, the FDA cleared Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Nexavar, or sorafenib. In January 2006, Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib, also won approval. "The group of patients who received Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival," the FDA said. Wyeth, in a statement, said its drug would be available for patients in July. Shares of the drugmaker earlier closed down 27 cents, or less than 1 percent, at $57.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Company data on Torisel showed that patients who took it alone lived 3.5 months longer overall than those who took it with the cancer drug interferon or a combination of the two, the FDA said.

"The system is really doing what taxpayers are paying us to do," Capital Health spokesman Steve Buick said today. "We are producing dramatically more services for people, but demand is running ahead so fast, especially in Alberta that we are still running to catch up." He was commenting on the annual report compiled by the Ottawa-based Canadian Institute for Health Information in conjunction with Statistics Canada. It does not include statistics from Quebec. Email to a friend While the report looks at about 40 different indicators of how health regions across the country compare in delivering services, this year's report focused on issues surrounding hip fracture surgery. "Generally it confirms Alberta's leadership and especially Capital Health and Calgary's on a whole range of important indicators," he said. In Alberta, 67 per cent of hip fracture surgeries were performed on the same day or the day after admission to hospital. The national average is 65 per cent. "Delays tend to be caused by other health problems these people have," Buick said. "So it's not surprising that a proportion of them are delayed because they are sick with other things." But at 1.1 per thousand, Alberta had a higher rates of people fracturing their hips while staying in the hospital than the national average of 0.8 per thousand. Buick said the report indicates health regions in the province could do a more efficient job in treating patients without admitting them to hospital. "We do generally very well, but when you look at the chart, Ontario and British Columbia's rates are lower than we are," he said. "We could be doing more to use hospital beds better."

Surgery May Be the Answer Surgery Often Provides Rapid Relief for Patients in Pain, Study Says Two new studies show how surgery may offer some patients faster relief from back pain than nonsurgical approaches. By SUPINDA BUNYAVANICH, M.D. ABC News Medical Unit For the millions of Americans with slipped discs and lower back pain, 30-year-old Andrew Neitzke's story strikes a familiar nerve. "My left leg hurt enough that I couldn't walk for more than a few minutes â€” sometimes even 30 seconds was difficult â€” and I also couldn't sit for long," he said. "The pain was even waking me during the night, and there were nights when I couldn't sleep at all." Back Pain -- Reason for Compensation or Cash Cow? Herbal Cure for Your Aching Back? Back Pain? Don't Sit Up Straight Beating Lower Back Pain -- Without Surgery Months of medications, physical therapy and steroid injections offered little relief. He was in a bind â€” should he wait it out, or go under the knife? Surgery May Speed Recovery Two studies in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine may help patients like Neitzke with their decision. The studies compare surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for two common lower spine conditions that cause pain. James Weinstein, of Dartmouth Medical School, and his colleagues studied more than 600 patients from 11 states with degenerative spondylolisthesis â€” a type of lower back pain caused by slippage of the bones of the spine. This slippage can cause parts of the backbone to press on nerves, potentially causing a great deal of pain. What researchers found was that the patients who ended up in an operating room â€” about 60 percent of those in the study â€” experienced less pain and better physical function after two years compared with those who did not have surgery. Those who opted for nonsurgical treatments â€” including pain medication, physical therapy, steroid injections and chiropractic treatment â€” also improved, but not to the same extent. "There are two major treatment options: operative and nonoperative," Weinstein said. "This trial shows there is clearly a greater benefit of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment, but nonsurgical treatment is also an option. "There were still many patients who never got surgery ... and it was good enough for them." In a separate trial, Dr. Wilco Peul and his colleagues studied nearly 300 Dutch patients with sciatica â€” a radiating pain in the leg from compression of nerves in the lower back, often caused by a slipped disc.

Later he flew back to North America because he feared he might die without treatment in the United States. Health officials in North America and Europe sought the passenger lists Wednesday for the two trans-Atlantic airline flights in their effort to find about 80 people who sat near the man, infected with a highly drug-resistant form of tuberculosis. Authorities also disclosed that the man was on several flights within Europe over the course of two weeks earlier this month. Passenger lists for those flights also were being tracked down, they said. &#8220;The investigation is just beginning. It&#8217;s very challenging,&#8221; said Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s division of global migration and quarantine. The man is under the first U.S. government-ordered quarantine since 1963. He continues to feel well and shows no symptoms, Cetron said. &#8220;Is the patient himself highly infectious? Fortunately, in this case, he&#8217;s probably not,&#8221; CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding said. &#8220;But the other piece is this bacteria is a very deadly bacteria. We just have to err on the side of caution.&#8221; CDC officials are concentrating on the trans-Atlantic flights, when the likelihood of spreading the disease was greatest because the man was in a confined space with other people for many hours. The CDC was trying to contact 27 crew members from the two flights for testing, along with about 80 passengers who sat in the five rows surrounding the man. Other passengers on the flights are not considered at high risk of infection because tests indicated the level of TB bacteria the man carried was low, Cetron said. CDC officials said they are working closely with airlines. Health officials in France said they have asked Air France-KLM for passenger lists, and the Italian Health Ministry said it is tracing the man&#8217;s movements. A spokeswoman for Czech airline CSA said medical checks showed no infections among its crew members who flew with the man. The airline also was contacting passengers. Health officials said that before he took the trip, the man had been advised not to fly and knew he could expose others to illness when he boarded the jets. He had a supply of masks to wear for the protection of other passengers, but it is not clear whether he used them, Cetron said. The man told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that doctors did not order him not to fly and only suggested he put off his long-planned wedding. He said he knew he had a form of tuberculosis and that it was resistant to commonly used drugs, but he did not realize until he was in Europe that it could be so dangerous. &#8220;We headed off to Greece thinking everything&#8217;s fine,&#8221; he told the newspaper. The newspaper did not identify him at his request, because of the stigma attached to his diagnosis. He flew to Paris on May 12 aboard Air France Flight 385, also listed as Delta Air Lines codeshare Flight 8517. He and his bride then took four more flights within Europe. While he was in Rome, health authorities reached him with the news that further tests had revealed his TB was a rare, &#8220;extensively drug-resistant&#8221; form, far more dangerous than he had known. They told him to turn himself over to Italian health officials and not to fly on commercial airlines. &#8220;I thought to myself: You&#8217;re nuts. I wasn&#8217;t going to do that. They told me I had been put on the no-fly list and my passport was flagged,&#8221; the man told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Instead, on May 24, the man flew from Rome to Prague. From Prague, the couple left for Montreal the same day, according to CDC officials. The man then drove into the United States at Champlain, N.Y. He told the newspaper he was afraid that if he did not get back to the United States, he wouldn&#8217;t get the treatment he needed. He is not facing prosecution, health officials said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a very well-educated, successful, intelligent person,&#8221; he told the paper. &#8220;This is insane to me that I have an armed guard outside my door when I&#8217;ve cooperated with everything other than the whole solitary-confinement-in-Italy thing.&#8221; The man is at Atlanta&#8217;s Grady Memorial Hospital under federal quarantine order. A sheriff&#8217;s deputy was assigned to guard him. The man has a right to appeal the order, but has not, Cetron said. A spokesman for Denver&#8217;s National Jewish Hospital, which specializes in respiratory disorders, said Wednesday the man would be treated there. It was not clear when he would arrive. The man&#8217;s wife tested negative for TB before the couple&#8217;s trip and is not considered a public health risk, health officials said. TRACKING THE TB PATIENT The Georgia man has a routine chest X-ray and a spot is found on his lung. The man is found to have tuberculosis and treatment begins. The man is notified in Atlanta that tests show he has multi-drug-resistant TB and should not travel. The man flies on Air France 285 from Atlanta to Paris. He flies on Air France 1232 from Paris to Athens to get married. He flies from Athens to Thira Island. He flies from Mykonos Island to Athens, then Athens to Rome. The CDC contacts him in Rome and tells him he has highly drug-resistant TB and should not take a commercial flight. He takes Czech Air 727 from Rome to Prague; Czech Air 104 from Prague to Montreal; drives into the United States at Champlain, N.Y. He enters New York hospital. Patient is taken to Atlanta&#8217;s Grady Memorial Hospital and placed in respiratory isolation. _&#8212; The Associated Press About the Real Cities Network About the McClatchy Company

Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston studied 60 healthy women -- 12 with high blood pressure (140/90 milligrams of mercury or higher) and 48 with normal blood pressure. All the women ate two kinds of diets for eight weeks each. One was the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet, which consisted of 30 percent of calories from fat (with 7 percent or less from saturated fat), 15 percent from protein, and 55 percent from carbohydrates, 1,200 milligrams of calcium per day, two meals of fatty fish (such as salmon or tuna) per week, and less than 200 milligrams of cholesterol a day. The other diet had the same calorie, fat and protein content, but the women replaced 25 grams of protein intake with one-half cup of unsalted soy nuts. "Soy nut supplementation significantly reduced systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure in all 12 hypertensive women and in 40 of the 48 normotensive women," the study authors wrote. "Compared with the TLC diet alone, the TLC diet plus soy nuts lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure 9.9 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively, in hypertensive women, and 5.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, in normotensive women." In women with high blood pressure, the soy nuts also decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein ("bad") cholesterol by an average of 11 percent and levels of apoliprotein B (a particle that carries bad cholesterol) by an average of 8 percent.

They're dry-roasted soybeans. Like other soy foods, they contain nutrients called isoflavones, along with 8 grams of fat and 240 calories in a half cup. When it comes to lowering blood pressure, they may be a smart snack for women, a new study suggests. The new study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine , included 60 healthy postmenopausal women who were 53-58 years old, on At the study's start, 12 of the women had high blood pressure. They tended to be a little heavier than the 48 other women with normal blood pressure based on average BMI (body mass index), which relates height to weight. High blood pressure makes heart disease and a host of other health problems During the study, the women spent eight weeks on a healthy diet that didn't include soy nuts. After that, they took a blood pressure test. The women also spent another eight weeks on the same healthy diet. But this time, they replaced some of their protein with half a cup of unsalted soy nuts, split into three or four portions spread throughout the day. Finally, the women took one more blood pressure test. The women's blood pressure was lowest after eight weeks of snacking on soy nuts, even for those who started the study with normal blood pressure. For the 12 women who had high blood pressure at the study's start, average systolic blood pressure (the first number in a blood pressure reading) dropped by nearly 10% and average diastolic blood pressure (the second number in a blood pressure reading) dropped by almost 7% after eight weeks of snacking on soy nuts. For the other 48 women who had normal blood pressure at the study's start, average systolic blood pressure dropped by about 5% and average diastolic blood pressure dropped by 3% after eight weeks of snacking on soy nuts. Women with high blood pressure also had an 11% drop in levels of their LDL ("bad") cholesterol after snacking on the soy nuts for eight weeks. No cholesterol benefits were seen in the women with normal blood pressure. The study doesn't show why soy nuts were linked to lower blood pressure. But the researchers write that diets that include soy foods "may be a practical, safe, and inexpensive" way to reduce blood pressure. Larger studies should be done to confirm the findings, wrote the researchers, who included Francine Welty, MD, PhD. Welty is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, preventive cardiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Specialized Center of Research in Vascular Injury, Repair, and Remodeling. Men weren't included in this study, but other research suggests that soy foods may help men's blood pressure, Welty noted. "The study was started to assess soy as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy. That's why men were not studied in this particular trial," Welty told WebMD. She noted that two other published studies have shown blood pressure reduction in men and women who ate soy foods as part of their diet. One of those studies included soy cookies; the other included soy milk. Reviewed by Louise Chang ©2007 WebMD, Inc. All rights reserved. Now you're in the public comment zone.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070531.wxpicard31/BNStory/specialScienceandHealth/home&cid globeandmail.com: Anti-smoking rules too mild Letters to the Editor Anti-smoking rules too mild From Thursday's Globe and Mail May 31, 2007 at 8:56 AM EDT It's been exactly one year since Quebec's sweeping smoking ban took effect on World No Tobacco Day. Smoking was banned in bars, restaurants, taverns, casinos, on school grounds and within nine metres of any exterior door of a health, social services or educational institution. Quebec was one of the last bastions of the smoky bar, and there were dire warnings that the province's legendary joie de vivre and nightlife would be crushed under the advances of Big Brother. Despite the sky-is-falling claims of some bar owners (most of them aligned with Big Tobacco), the world as we know it did not come to a grinding, smokeless halt. Bar business did not go &#34;poof.&#34; Bingo halls did not go bankrupt. Nicotine addicts did not drop dead outside hospitals as they trudged nine metres from the door desperately searching for a place for a legal puff. In fact, according to a new poll, the smoking ban is enormously popular with the public: 78 per cent of Quebeckers surveyed - including 60 per cent of current smokers - said the legislation has improved the health and quality of life of citizens. Interestingly, it is young adults aged 18 to 24 - the demographic that tends to hang out in bars and restaurants and the age group in which smoking is most popular - who are the most enthusiastic about the smoke-free rules. &#34;The more people go to bars the more they appreciate the new law,&#34; said Louis Gauvin, spokesman for the Quebec Coalition for Tobacco Control. According to the Quebec poll, about one in 10 smokers have kicked the habit in the year since the ban was introduced. The quit rate was twice as high, 21 per cent, in the youngest age group. Now, you can dismiss the poll as the work of anti-tobacco zealots, but nothing in the survey is the least bit surprising. The majority of provinces and territories - British Columbia and Alberta being the notable exceptions - have comprehensive smoke-free legislation, and municipal bylaws are commonplace. All the credible research has repeatedly shown the same results: smoke-free laws have no discernible impact on sales of food or liquor; smoking bans help people quit; outlawing smoking is popular with the general public; and the stronger and the more extensive the ban, the more bang you get for your buck in terms of public-health benefits. Yet for all the perceived bellyaching by business, and strong public support for smoke-free legislation, laws remain pretty tame in Canada. Quebec, for example, still allows smoking on most patios (why restaurant and bar owners reserve prime seating for smokers, a small minority, defies logic) and the sidewalks outside some bars and office towers are like giant ashtrays, a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the law. Similarly, it remains far too easy to buy cigarettes, even for minors. And our health system provides paltry support to those trying to quit. Fewer than 20 per cent of Canadians now smoke. Yet we still tolerate smoking in virtually all public spaces such as parks and allow parents to smoke in cars in the presence of their children, areas where numerous European jurisdictions have cracked down. It is clear that there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. There are about 4,000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke, more than 50 of them carcinogenic. Exposure to second-hand smoke causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and worsens existing conditions such as asthma. Sound public-health policy requires that all workplaces and public places be 100-per-cent smoke-free. No exceptions. This is not a persecution of smokers: it is necessary for the protection of non-smokers. Many policy makers and public-health officials think of anti-smoking campaigns as pass&#233; and boring. But tobacco remains a leading killer, claiming the lives of 45,000 Canadians a year. It also costs the economy about $24-billion annually in medical costs and productivity losses. Globally, smoking already claims more than five million lives a year, and tobacco companies have shifted their marketing efforts and opposition to anti-smoking legislation to the developing world. Unless dramatic and sustained action is taken, smoking will kill more than one billion people worldwide in the 21st Century - 10 times the number who died in the 20th Century. Smoking is not somebody else's problem. It is a continuing public-health disaster and a drain on prosperity. We should think of that each time we enjoy a meal or a drink in a smoke-free restaurant or bar. And each puff of smoke that assaults us when walking down the sidewalk, or that blows across a patio to sour an outing, should serve as a reminder that much more remains to be done.

T.O. neonatal unit shut after infection kills baby Updated Thu. May. 31 2007 9:06 AM ET The neonatal intensive care unit at a downtown Toronto hospital has been shut down after a premature baby died from a highly feared bacterial infection, according to a newspaper report. The infant died of bacteremia, commonly known as blood poisoning, at Mount Sinai Hospital, said the hospital's director of infection control Dr. Allison McGeer. She said the blood poisoning occurred after the baby acquired serratia, a harmful pathogen that can cause severe infections in babies. "This is one of the organisms we really worry about it," McGeer told The Globe and Mail. "... This is not an organism you take any chances with." The infant, weighing between one and three pounds, died over the weekend. "It is so awful for new parents, such a tragedy that these babies die," said McGeer. "It's also extremely hard on the staff who work in the unit because every one of those babies is their baby, too." A second baby also tested positive for serratia, which can lead to pneumonia, meningitis and bacteremia infections. The infant is in isolation at the hospital but is not seriously ill. The death has prompted the hospital to impose special infection control procedures, including improved hand hygiene and mandatory gowns and gloves in the neonatal intensive care unit. The hospital's level 3 neonatal unit remained closed Wednesday night but level 2 was reopened on Wednesday afternoon. The neonatal ward is currently operating at maximum capacity and the hospital has plans to expand the space in order to prevent sick infants from being in close proximity. To minimize infection, experts recommend incubators be placed at least 10 feet apart. The Mount Sinai incubators are currently placed four to five feet apart. According to Dick Zoutman, physician director of the Community and Hospital Infection Control Association of Canada, hospital-acquired infections are the fourth leading cause of death among patients. Zoutman told the newspaper between 8,000 and 12,000 Canadians die from hospital-acquired infections every year.

The level of wellness or health is, in part, determined by the ability to deal with and defend against stress. Health is determined by physiological, psychological, socio-cultural, spiritual, and developmental stage variables. 5 ways you can beat lower back pain Buy best Back Pain products from Amazon Back Pain :: 5 ways you can beat lower back pain The National Institutes of Health estimates that eight out of ten people will suffer from back pain, making it one of the most common medical problems today. The good news is that you can treat it, minimize it, and even prevent it by following some back-friendly guidelines. Most adults will experience lower back pain sometime during their lifetime. The good news is you can usually prevent or reduce the pain yourself. Lower back pain is something that almost everyone will experience at some time in their lives. In fact, the National Institutes of Health estimates that eight out of ten people will suffer from back pain, making it one of the most common medical problems today. It affects women and men equally, and can happen at any age, according to The Cleveland Clinic’s Arthritis Advisor. That’s the bad news. The good news is that you can treat it, minimize it, and even prevent it by following some back-friendly guidelines. “The better physical condition you’re in, the less likely you’ll injure your back,” says Santhosh Thomas, D.O., medical director of Cleveland Clinic’s Westlake Spine Center. “That’s why everybody can benefit from strong abdominal and back muscles.” Many factors can cause lower back pain. Thankfully, most cases are not serious and respond to simple, non-invasive treatments. Trauma and injuries from sprains and strains are common culprits, but pain can also stem from degenerative conditions such as arthritis and osteoporosis. Bone disease, viral infections, irritation to joints, disc herniation, and congenital abnormalities in the spine can also cause an achy back. Poor body mechanics can cause problems, too. If you’ve overdone it playing golf or pulling up weeds, the result is likely to be a sore back. “You can just sleep awkwardly and get a stiff back,” says Dr. Thomas. Age also plays a part. As you get older, bone strength and muscle elasticity decrease while your spinal discs begin to lose fluid and flexibility, which decreases their ability to cushion the spine’s vertebrae. Certain health-related conditions and habits—such as obesity, stress, poor posture, and smoking—can also aggravate your back. Because it’s such a common problem, it might be tempting to treat back pain as a minor matter. But Dr. Thomas says it’s important to seek medical care if you experience severe pain—particularly pain that wakes you at night—pain that radiates from your back into your legs, or pain that doesn’t go away in a reasonable amount of time. These symptoms could indicate more serious conditions than just a strained muscle. Fortunately, most cases of lower back pain can be treated at home. Ice or a cold pack can ease soreness, Dr. Thomas says, although some people find more relief from applying heat or taking a hot shower or bath. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol), are also helpful. If you find such remedies don’t help, muscle relaxants or prescription-strength pain medicine may be pre-scribed. Your doctor may also refer you to a specialist for physical therapy targeted at easing the pain as well as strengthening your back muscles. Surgery, Dr. Thomas says, is the last resort for most conditions. Once your pain has subsided enough to allow you to comfortably move about, exercise is recommended. “Anything that keeps your joints moving and maintains flexibility is good for you,” says Dr. Thomas. “Walking, biking, and swimming are particularly beneficial if you suffer from back pain.” Meanwhile, consider the exercises shown here to keep back pain at bay. As with any exercise program, check with your doctor before you begin.

The study, published in the American Journal of Neuroscience, was conducted on mice. The scientists now plan to study the effects of the chemical epicatechin on memory and brain blood flow in aged animals and then humans, combined with mild exercise. The food chemical epicatechin is one of a group of chemicals known as flavanols found in certain food items including chocolate, tea, grapes and blueberries. Earlier studies have already shown that the antioxidant compound flavanol could help improve cardiovascular health. Now the researchers, led by Henriette van Praag, working with chocolate firm Mars, compared mice that were fed a normal diet with those that were fed a diet supplemented with epicatechin. Half the mice in each group were allowed to run on a wheel for two hours each day and were trained to find a platform hidden in a pool of water, a month later. Those mice that exercised and ate the epicatechin diet remembered the location of the platform longer than the other mice. The epicatechin-fed mice who did not exercise also showed enhanced memory, but to a lesser degree. The mice on the special diet appeared to have greater blood vessel growth in certain parts of their brain, along with more mature brain nerve cells, the online edition of BBC News reported. "This is important because it identifies a single natural chemical with memory-enhancing effects, suggesting it may be possible to optimise brain function by combining exercise and dietary supplementation," Mark Mattson, a doctor at the US National Institute on Ageing, said. However, nutritionists warned chocolate is high in fat and sugar, which may undo any potential benefits. They recommended a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, with perhaps a small amount of chocolate.

Three of the men – all of whom have HIV and were arrested on Sunday – were suspected of drugging other men and abusing them during sex parties. “The suspicion is that at these parties, they had unsafe sex with people they had drugged, and also that these people were injected with infected blood,” district police chief Ronald Zwarter said. “The motive to do this was the ’kick,’ and the feeling that unsafe sex is ’pure,”’ Zwarter said. Two of the suspects confessed to injecting the victims. The fourth suspect is suspected of selling “a considerable amount of drugs,” including Ecstasy and GHB, an intoxicant that is sometimes known as a “date rape” drug, police said. All four were brought before a judge yesterday and were ordered held for 90 days. Police said they didn’t rule out further arrests and called on other victims to come forward, or contact a help line to receive HIV testing. © Thomas Crosbie Media 2007.

Preliminary investigations by the country's health officials have suggested a potential link between the infections - caused by a parasitic amoeba - and use of a moisture-locking contact solution. But some experts believe that the outbreak simply signifies a larger problem with multipurpose contact solutions that simultaneously aim to disinfect and lubricate lenses. On 25 May, Advanced Medical Optics announced a of its Complete MoisturePlus contact solution. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory the same day tentatively linking this lens solution to the outbreak of keratitis - damage to the cornea cased by a toxin released by the parasite. About one quarter of the people with the infection require corneal transplants. The CDC said it had received reports of 138 recent cases of the infection across 35 states. Of this group, the agency had full clinical data for 46 patients, 39 of whom wore soft contact lenses. And of those who wore such lenses, 58% used Complete MoisturePlus contact solution. Still, Advanced Medical Optics stresses that there is currently no direct evidence showing the solution was contaminated with the In 2006, health officials connected the MoistureLoc contact solution made by Bausch & Lomb to a similar corneal infection called keratitis, caused by a fungus. Exactly how the solution contributed to this infection remains unclear, however. The reasons for the more recent keratitis outbreak has similarly puzzled experts. "I don't think there is a single consensus about the reason for the increased reporting of infections," says ophthalmologist Steven Verity at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. He points out that the microbe is ubiquitous: "It's basically found everywhere. You can't run away from it." The waterborne parasite is present in tap water, hot tubs and lakes, for example. "We're exposed to this stuff all day, every day," explains Kathryn Colby of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston. Colby has treated four patients with keratitis in the past year, and says the number of such cases seems to be on the rise. There are few treatments for the infection, and doctors sometime must resort to applying baquacil - a swimming pool cleaner - to patients' eyes. Normally, a protective layer about six cells thick on the outside of the cornea prevents the parasite from establishing itself in the eye. Colby believes that the combination of newer, silicone hydrogel contact lenses, and lens solution that locks in moisture, might create a "perfect storm" that dismantles this protective layer outside the cornea. This, in turn, would make the eye susceptible to infection. There has been some suggestion that changes in chlorination of water supplies has increased the prevalence of , notes Dan Jones, chairman of ophthalmology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, US. But Jones agrees that some chemical component in the moisture-locking solutions probably plays a large role in promoting eye infection. According Jones, the US Food and Drug Administration "must step in" and "look critically at multipurpose contact lens solution". He suggests that it might be best to revert to using separate solutions to disinfect and lubricate contact lenses. Cornea specialists say that health officials should quickly address the recent outbreak of keratitis. "It's really a wake-up call that some current contact solutions are not doing the job," says Colby. Experts say that people should avoid "risky behaviours" such as swimming in lakes and rivers while wearing contact lenses. And even washing the face in tap water can be a cause of infection. People are also advised to change their eye solution every day, not merely top up the solution sitting in the lens cases. Colby also urges people to consider wearing disposable daily lenses instead of those that are replaced every month.

Siti Fadilah Supari, Indonesia's health minister, said the clinical trial would involve "hundreds of participants" and conclude in October, according to an Associated Press (AP) report published today. She also said Indonesia would initially stockpile 2 million doses of the vaccine. In February, Indonesia revealed it had stopped sharing H5N1 virus samples with the World Health Organization (WHO) in a protest against drug companies' use of the samples to make vaccines seen as too costly for developing countries. Soon afterward Indonesia signed a memorandum of understanding with US-based Baxter International, owner of Baxter Healthcare, which laid the groundwork for future collaboration or supply agreements on H5N1 vaccines. Chris Bona, a Baxter spokesman in Deerfield, Ill., told CIDRAP News today that the company has not announced any plans for a clinical trial of its vaccine in Indonesia and has not signed any new agreements with Indonesia beyond the initial memorandum of understanding in February. Bona said there were no firm plans to produce the company's vaccine in Indonesia and no agreements about stockpiling. In addition, any Indonesian H5N1 samples Baxter would use to develop a vaccine would likely come directly from the WHO, Bona said. On May 15 Indonesia announced it had resumed sharing its H5N1 samples with the WHO. A week later, during the annual meeting of WHO member countries, the WHO negotiated a preliminary agreement designed to maintain the international sharing of flu virus samples while ensuring that developing countries can obtain pandemic flu vaccines Baxter has a cell culture&#150;based H5N1 vaccine under development. Last October the company said the preliminary results of a phase I/II clinical trial showed a good immune response against drifted H5N1 strains. The vaccine was based on a 2004 strain of H5N1 from Vietnam.

This time around, the product is Complete MoisturePlus, manufactured by Advanced Medical Optics (AMO), on news from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that the multi-purpose solution is linked to a rare but serious eye infection that can severely corrode the cornea and even lead to blindness. The recall is the latest in a string that has kept contact wearers wondering what solution is safe to use. Just a year ago, Bausch & Lomb was the company in the hot seat after the CDC released data on a different kind of eye infection that showed a disproportionate number of people suffering from the disease had been using the company's ReNu with MoistureLoc. The company issued a massive recall and discontinued the solution worldwide. Since then, there has been a handful of less-widespread recalls, set off by issues ranging from bacterial contamination in a Chinese plant to the detection of trace amounts of iron that could cause lens cleaner to lose its effectiveness. The narrative of the Complete MoisturePlus recall, announced on May 25, closely echoes what happened last year with ReNu MoistureLoc, although the microbes involved were different. In each case, local clinicians first noticed an uptick in a rare eye condition and reported the spike to the CDC, which launched an investigation and subsequently found that many people with the disease reported using the same contact solution. The disease involved in last year's ReNu MoistureLoc recall was the fungal infection keratitis. The disease associated with the Complete MoisturePlus recall is caused by , a water-borne parasite that occurs naturally but in the human eye can lead to serious infections of the cornea. The CDC interviewed 46 people who had the condition, called keratitis, and found that 21 of them reported using Complete MoisturePlus &#151; amounting to a risk seven times greater for people using the product than those who weren't. At this point, it isn't clear why that correlation exists. Or what lessons might be drawn from the similarity of this year's recall with last year's. "We're not prepared to make any generalizations at the moment," says CDC medical epidemiologist Dr. Sharon Roy, "but it does bring up questions about multi-purpose solutions." One of those questions, says cornea specialist Dr. William Ehlers, is whether multi-purpose solutions, standard products for soft contact lens wearers, are as effective as earlier peroxide-based cleaners. In fact, some studies show that peroxide-based cleaners, which involve a two-step cleaning process and bubbling action to remove dirt and build-up, are better at killing certain types of organisms. But they are also more cumbersome to use than multi-purpose solution, which simply involves a rinse. "Manufacturers have wanted to produce solutions that are convenient and comfortable, but it may be a trade-off to a certain extent between convenience and efficacy," says Dr. Ehlers, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut Health Center. Does that mean that consumers should go back to older types of cleaners? Dr. Ehlers says: "People ought to be having this conversation with their eye-care professional." Another factor in last year's case that may resurface in this newest warning is how people misuse contact lenses and solution. Reusing or topping off old solution is a classic way to encourage infection. No-nos such as rinsing the inside of a contact case with water instead of solution, or showering or swimming while wearing lenses, may prove to be linked to the Complete MoisturePlus recall, since the parasite involved is water-borne. But the CDC's Roy is careful to point out that the investigation is still in its early stages, and little is known so far beyond the initial link. In the meantime, for the decision-averse, at least there's one less solution on the shelf to choose from.

Dr. Ronald Krall, medical director of the pharmaceutical giant, posted a letter in the online version of The Lancet medical journal saying data from long-term, large-scale clinical trials has shown Avandia to be safe. Research reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last week revealed a 43 percent increase in heart attacks among diabetics who took Avandia. The death rate for those who experienced heart attacks, according to the analysis led by Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, was a staggering 63 percent. Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group at the Washington, D.C.-based consumer watchdog organization Public Citizen, said diabetics using Avandia should focus on scientific data. GlaxoSmithKline has financial reasons in mind, Wolfe said, when reporting that Avandia poses no risks to diabetics. "When they say it's safe and doesn't produce a heart-attack risk, I can understand that as a marketing strategy, but it does not accord with the facts," Wolfe said. "They're trying to counter the bad publicity their drug has gotten over the past couple of weeks." The study's troubling news isn't the first to thrust Avandia into the spotlight. In January of last year there was a shortage of the drug because of production problems at GlaxoSmithKline's manufacturing plant in Cidra, Puerto Rico. The company said the delay had nothing to do with the drug itself and that other GlaxoSmithKline medications manufactured at the plant were also in short supply. In his letter yesterday, Krall included data from two large clinical trials in which Avandia was tested. Both studies, he said, demonstrated that the drug is safe and effective. But Wolfe said a "black box" warning should be attached to Avandia's label. A black box warning is the FDA's highest level of caution. The Food and Drug Administration is advising diabetics to talk to their physicians about the medication. In an alert posted last week on its Web site, the FDA noted that other studies have found the drug poses no harm. Last week, Public Citizen released what it said was an internal 2002 FDA memo, showing that the agency was aware of heart failure cases associated with Avandia and another diabetes drug called Actos, manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceuticals of Illinois. Both drugs are in the class known as thiazolidinediones. Wolfe said he had been warning consumers since 1994 not to take Avandia. "The real irony here is this: The main reason anyone takes a diabetes drug is to prevent cardiovascular risk because heart disease is the main condition that diabetics die of," Wolfe said. "Now there's evidence that it causes cardiovascular disease." Subscribe to Newsday home delivery Article licensing and reprint options Post a comment |

And women with moderately elevated blood pressure -- a condition known as pre-hypertension -- also showed reductions in their blood pressure after eight weeks of eating soy nuts, Dr. Francine K. Welty of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and her colleagues found. "We know that people in the pre-hypertension group are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease," Welty told Reuters Health in an interview. "This would provide a dietary treatment that could safely lower blood pressures in that pre-hypertensive range." She pointed out that while studies are still underway to determine if people with pre-hypertension should take drugs to lower their blood pressure. Welty and her team recruited 60 postmenopausal women, 12 of whom had hypertension, to begin the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet, which involves cutting fat, cholesterol, sodium and calories. Each study participant spent eight weeks on the TLC diet alone and eight weeks on the TLC diet plus a half-cup of dry-roasted, unsalted soy nuts daily. While eating the soy nuts, the women subtracted the equivalent amount of protein from other sources so their protein consumption remained constant. The researchers chose soy nuts, Welty noted, because they are among the least processed sources of soy available, and are more convenient and portable than either soy milk or tofu. Hypertensive women in the soy nut-group had a drop in systolic blood pressure (the top number of the blood pressure reading) of 9.9 percent, and a drop in diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) of 6.8 percent. Among those with pre-hypertension (systolic blood pressures between 120 mmHg and 139 mmHg), the soy nuts decreased systolic blood pressure by 5.5 percent and diastolic blood pressure by 2.7 percent. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Poor diets based on fatty and sweet ingredients combined with the lack of physical exercise account for six of the seven top factors leading to bad health, according to EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou. “Now the biggest problem of obesity is in the southern member states who have abandoned the Mediterranean diet and go for the same kind of nutrition of fast food as elsewhere,” he said. In second place on the obesity lists come men from Malta and women from Cyprus. The Commission said that it was considering tightening food advertising and nutrition labeling rules if companies failed to improve consumer awareness about unhealthy foods. Kyprianou said that he wanted to “encourage” food companies to provide consumers with full information about the health risks associated with their products. A few hundred pensioners...

Win a luxurious VIP ticket package for four to Swan Lake at the Royal Albert Hall with English National Ballet. Dutch couple may have injected dozens with HIV more articles by Gus Cairns Four HIV positive men from Groeningen province in the north of the Netherlands, in a sensational case, have confessed to the police that they held sex parties where they drugged men with GHB and injected them with their own blood in an attempt to infect them. Dutch HIV workers told Gay.com that they were aware that at least 10 men who attended the sex parties had contracted HIV – which implies that considerably more men were victims of the assaults. The accused are two 48-year old men from Slochteren and two men from Groeningen aged 33 and 34. Two have confessed to the sexual assault and deliberate infection attempts: the other two have so far only admitted to dealing in huge quantities of GHB. One does not define as gay. Five victims between the ages of 25 and 50 have reported to the police so far and four of them have filed charges. The Dutch public prosecutor has charged the men with premeditated grievous bodily harm, but said it could not charge them with attempted murder or manslaughter because “the life expectancy of the victims can be extended with medication.” The offence carries a maximum penalty of 16 years in prison. Gay.com spoke to Robert Witlox, Director of the Dutch HIV Association, who takes up the story. “We became aware that something odd was going on in Groeningen about a year ago. Someone came to a support group for people newly diagnosed with HIV and gave us this story about having been drugged unconscious with GHB and raped, which was how he got the virus. “At first we dismissed it – you hear many such stories in support groups – but several other people came forward with similar stories. One said he had come to to find a man still fucking him without a condom while another said that during the experience he had felt a sharp needle-like pain in his anus.” The suspects have confessed that they took syringes of blood missed from all four of them and injected them into their victims’ anuses. Witlox continues: “The men would advertise small sex parties – 3-5 people - on the internet. It appears they were doing it on a frequent basis, and it continued right up till they were arrested in May. “We alerted the public health department in Groeningen who said they had heard similar stories. They put out a press release warning gay men warning gay men about attending sex parties and saying they had noticed a rise in local HIV infections. “We finally persuaded the first victim – who does not publicly identify as gay – to make a formal complaint to the police in January.” Witlox commented that one of the features of the case was that the victims appeared largely to be non-gay-identified men seeking bisexual thrills on the internet. The two who have made confessions to the police said that they were motivated by lust and because if they made other men positive they’d have the opportunity to have unprotected sex with them. Witlox comments: “In many ways this is a straightforward case. The legal argument about HIV transmission has always been about reckless infection,” (i.e. not meaning to infect, but not caring either), “whereas this is a clear case of rape and of attempted deliberate infection. Judging by the confessions, the accused must have had psychiatric problems around having HIV. “In talking to the media yesterday, not just myself but also representatives from the Dutch Health Ministry said that this behaviour was not typical of gay men or people with HIV.” Witlox added, however, that since then his organisation has been accused of fostering a culture of normalising unsafe sex. “Journalists are now linking the case with the fact that we have a support group called Positive and Proud where subjects like serosorting” (i.e. consensual unprotected sex between HIV positive people) “are discussed. We’ve been asked if we have any norms. “We’ve said: ‘Yes, we do; we’re saying it’s not alright to rape people and deliberately infect them with HIV!’” Image courtesy of the excellent &copy;1995-2007 PLANETOUT INC.

Researchers at Aberdeen University in Scotland worked with those in Italy, Sweden, Romania and Malta to look at the life histories of 959 patients suffering from Parkinson's and 1,989 patients who were not to try and tease out the possible causes for the disease. Short-term antioxidant doesn't help Parkinson's FDA OKs Drug Patch to Treat Parkinson's They found that having close family members with Parkinson's increased an individual's risk for the disease by five times, being knocked unconscious more than once increased the risk two and a half times and having high pesticide exposure in work or hobbies made someone 33 percent more likely to contract Parkinson's. The study was published this week in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. "It's a solid study, [but] it has the limitations of many studies of this type," said Harvey Checkoway, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who was not involved with the research. Parkinson's is the second most common degenerative brain disease, following Alzheimer's, afflicting around 1 million Americans, including 1 percent of all Americans above the age of 60. The World's Most Famous Parkinson's Patient Parkinson's supposed link to head injury is most commonly associated with three-time heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, who was diagnosed in 1983, nearly two years after his retirement from the sport. But many experts dispute the connection. "I'm a little lost to understand why they believe that is related to his head injuries," said Thomas Hammeke, co-chief of the neuropsychology division at the Medical College of Wisconsin. He said that the rate of Parkinson's disease for boxers has not been shown to be any higher than for other professions. He added that football players, despite often suffering multiple concussions, have not been shown to suffer widely from the disease. Comment on This Story WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

The disease was first discovered and its symptoms documented in 1817-Essay on the Shaking Palsy, by the British physician Dr. James Parkinson; the associated biochemical changes in the brain of patients were identified in the 1960s. Biogen Idec & Vernalis Plc starts trial of BIIB014 in Parkinson's Disease Buy best Parkinson's Disease products from Amazon Parkinson's Disease :: Biogen Idec & Vernalis Plc starts trial of BIIB014 in Parkinson's Disease Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) and Vernalis plc (LSE: VER, Nasdaq: VNLS) announced the initiation of the Phase II program of BIIB014 (also known as V2006), an oral compound, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. BIIB014 is an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist that may offer a non-dopaminergic therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease. The initial Phase II study is a double-blind, placebo controlled randomised trial of single and repeated doses of BIIB014 in patients with late-stage Parkinson's disease. In the trial BIIB014 will be added on to the patients usual L-dopa therapy. The second Phase II study will be a double-blind, placebo controlled randomised, dose-ranging trial of BIIB014 monotherapy in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease. The primary endpoint of both studies will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB014. Secondary endpoints will include the evaluation of motor function. Simon Sturge, CEO of Vernalis commented: "The progress into Phase II trials is of particular significance to Vernalis' growing Parkinson's disease franchise and further demonstrates the company's ongoing commitment to the Parkinson's community. Dopamine replacement therapy has been the cornerstone of Parkinson's disease therapy, but there is a real need for a new class of non-dopaminergic agents which may help to restore motor function in Parkinson's disease patients without inducing the adverse effects that limit the clinical utility of current therapies." "BIIB014 has the potential to be a novel, non-dopaminergic treatment option for people living with Parkinson's disease. We are pleased with the advancement of this program, which is part of Biogen Idec's effort to extend our research and development capabilities beyond multiple sclerosis and into other neurological diseases," said Alfred Sandrock, MD, PhD, Senior Vice President, Neurology Research and Development, Biogen Idec. Phase I development of BIIB014 was successfully completed by Vernalis, with Biogen Idec now responsible for conducting and funding future development.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/9-6&fd=R&url=http://www.towleroad.com/2007/05/dutch_arrest_4_.html&cid=1116816902&ei=m-xeRuzZAoL0rQOB45zVDQ Dutch Arrest 4 for Gay Sex Party HIV Blood Injections -- Towleroad for modern gay men, &laquo; David Hyde Pierce Nudged Out of the Closet Montreal Gay Bar Faces Complaint for "Men Only" Policy &raquo; Dutch Arrest 4 for Gay Sex Party HIV Blood Injections At least five men who claim they were raped at a Dutch gay sex party led authorities to arrest four others, two of whom have confessed to intentionally injecting men with HIV-infected blood . Police also arrested two others, one for his alleged involvement in the rapes, and another for selling a "considerable amount of drugs" including ecstasy and GHB. District police chief Ronald Zwarter talked to the Associated Press about the incidents, which took place in the northern city of Groningen. Said Zwarter: "The suspicion is that, at these parties, they had unsafe sex with people they had drugged, and also that these people were injected with infected blood. The motive to do this was the 'kick,' and the feeling that unsafe sex is 'pure'." According to the AP, "Prosecution spokesman Paul Heidanus said Thursday that the two who confessed would face charges of rape and "premeditated severe assault, which carries a maximum sentence of 16 years in prison. He said they would not be charged with attempted murder 'because of a Supreme Court ruling that found AIDS should no longer be seen as an inevitably fatal disease, but rather a chronic illness,' Heidanus said." : "Police began investigating the gay parties after receiving tips, some from AIDS groups. The police confiscated several liters of GHB, sometimes known as a 'rape drug' used to make people unconscious, as well as thousands of ecstasy pills, photographs and other evidence. A court in Groningen on Wednesday ordered the suspects to be held in prison for at least 90 days." According to a police statement, all the victims said they thought they had been infected with HIV: "The victims said they had had been made helpless or unconscious and then abused. They had ... involuntary and unsafe sex with one or more of the suspects." Authorities said there may be both further arrests, and more victims out there. Dutch police arrest 4 men in bizarre sex-crime investigation Yes...so pure. And rape is a compliment. Unreal. The logical next step from people who eroticize the RISK of barebacking? Okay, maybe not the next step. But seriously, to be that fixated on taboo sexual release that you're willing to do something like this, it's a great argument for abstinence. And there aren't many great arguments for abstinence. | May 31, 2007 9:08:33 AM Is Aids cured yet? Is an HIV person quarenteed to live to 80 years old? The death sentence that it is might be stretched out over a longer period of time and with less disc omfort BUT it is still a death sentence till they have a cure. The cocktails do not prolong one's life to the national average life span. It is F'd up to not prosecute these freaks of humanity for attempted murder. I would have no moral objections what so ever if the victims in this case resorted to some vigilante justice. You know that Pat robertson, focus on the family, and such are going to play this case up big time as an example of what they claim we all are and do. | May 31, 2007 9:16:59 AM Hopefully the men will be provided with post-exposure prophylaxis. They might still make it out of this OK. | May 31, 2007 9:37:21 AM Yes gabriel lets hope post-exposure prophyla to be effective, it must be started as soon as possible after exposure and ideally within an hour Idealy within 1 hour of exposure. That is not a large window especialy for guys who were drugged up. They probably didn't even realize what had happened till it was too late to be effective | May 31, 2007 9:49:59 AM I have no sympathy for the victims, I'm afraid. If you play with matches, you get burned. If you go to parties with drugs and diseased people, don't be surprised if something bad happens to you. Simple common sense..... | May 31, 2007 10:14:48 AM I just can't even read this. | May 31, 2007 10:51:15 AM This has got to be one of the most sick and twisted stories I have read in a long time, but to go to a sex party then claim you were raped? I'm sorry, I'm not buying it. Aren't sex and drugs, and yes, risky sexual behavior common and pretty much expected at a sex party? But to not charge them with some kind of crime for injecting them with HIV infected blood? That is just sick! Sick! Sick! Sick! | May 31, 2007 10:54:32 AM I can't even read comments like Brad's and Troy's. They must live in some sort of utopia where they ALWAYS make the right decisions (and people are raped just for attending a sex party). | May 31, 2007 11:04:21 AM I'm with you Brian, no sympathy for the alleged "victims." Anyone that goes to a "sex party" is playing with fire and should be ready to deal with the consequences, this sort of thing makes gay men look like some sort of freaks who can't control their sexual urges. | May 31, 2007 11:11:44 AM i can't believe what i'm reading? saying that they deserved this? who are these people writing comments? the phelps klan? | May 31, 2007 11:22:13 AM I have sympathy for the victims, unlike some here. Yes, risky bareback sex is common (but not ubiquitous) at sex parties, and yes, drug use is common (but not ubiquitous) at sex parties, but really, c'mon. They were (if we are to believe police accounts of the event) drugged into unconsciousness, raped by multiple men (yes, it WAS rape--obviously if they were unconscious or severely intoxicated they couldn't legally consent to sexual activity), and deliberately injected with HIV-positive blood for no other reason than to infect them. They weren't "bug chasers" or guys looking to be screwed roughly while in a drugged stupor, because if they were, they wouldn't have gone to the authorities after the incident. How can anyone NOT feel sympathy for them? Their behavior wasn't laudable but they didn't sign up for what happened to them. To shrug one's shoulders and say "they got what they deserved" or "what did they expect?" or something similar betrays an alarming callousness and deficit of compassion--something I'd expect from our right-wing enemies, not from fellow gay brothers. With gay "brothers" like some of the commenters here, who needs Fred Phelps and his gang? When did we gays become so harsh and cold and judgmental of our own? You might have a problem with sex parties and drug use, but when did those activities become rationalizations for rape and deliberate, nonconsensual infection with HIV? Have we come to hate life and each other that much? This all sounds creepily similar to the old saw that a woman deserved to be raped because she was wearing skimpy clothing...blech. | May 31, 2007 11:49:44 AM Rouquinricain......what do you expect? There are people still to this day who blame the woman for being raped and we already know there are a lot of stupid assholes who think rape is some form of erotic turn on. I might go to a sex party.....but no where does that give anyone the right to drug me, have sex with me without MY ok, and to inject me with what can still be a death sentance. Maybe the creeps above will crawl back into their slimy hole now. | May 31, 2007 11:50:46 AM Rouquinricain......what do you expect?

Washington, D.C. - infoZine - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Torisel (temsirolimus) for the treatment of a certain type of advanced kidney cancer known as renal cell carcinoma. Torisel was approved based on a study that showed use of the drug prolonged survival of patients with renal cell carcinoma. The drug is an enzyme inhibitor, a protein that regulates cell production, cell growth and cell survival. "We have made significant advances in the battle against kidney cancer," said Steven Galson, M.D., M.P.H., director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Torisel is the third drug approved for this indication in the past 18 months, and one that shows an increased time in survival for some patients." The approval of Torisel follows the December 2005 approval of Nexavar (sorafenib), which was based on a delay in progression of disease. In January 2006, Sutent (sunitinib) received accelerated approval based on durable response rate, or tumor size reduction, and was later demonstrated to delay tumor progression. The safety and effectiveness of Torisel were shown in a clinical trial of 626 patients divided into three groups. One group received Torisel alone, another received a comparison drug called Interferon alfa, and a third received a combination of Torisel and interferon. The group of patients who received Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival. The median overall survival was 10.9 months for patients on Torisel alone versus 7.3 months for those treated with the interferon alone. Progression-free survival (when the disease does not get worse) increased from 3.1 months on the interferon alone arm to 5.5 months on the Torisel alone arm. The combination of Torisel and interferon did not result in a significant increase in overall survival when compared with interferon alone. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 30 percent of Torisel-treated patients, were rash, fatigue, mouth sores, nausea, edema, and loss of appetite. The most common laboratory abnormalities were high blood sugar, elevated blood lipids and triglycerides, elevated liver and kidney blood tests, and low red cell, white cell, and platelet counts. Renal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in about 51,000 people annually in the United States, accounts for about 85 percent of all U.S. adult kidney cancer.

Health is determined by physiological, psychological, socio-cultural, spiritual, and developmental stage variables. Natural compound and exercise may boost memory Buy best Aging products from Amazon Aging :: Natural compound and exercise may boost memory A natural compound found in blueberries, tea, grapes and cocoa enhances memory in mice, according to newly published research. This effect increased further when mice also exercised regularly. "This finding is an important advance because it identifies a single natural chemical with memory-enhancing effects, suggesting that it may be possible to optimize brain function by combining exercise and dietary supplementation," says Mark Mattson, PhD, at the National Institute on Aging. The compound, epicatechin, is one of a group of chemicals known as flavonols and has been shown previously to improve cardiovascular function in people and increase blood flow in the brain. Flavonols are found in some chocolate. Henriette van Praag, PhD, of the Salk Institute, and colleagues there and at Mars, Inc., showed that the combination of exercise and a diet with epicatechin also promoted structural and functional changes in the dentate gyrus, a part of the brain involved in the formation of learning and memory. The findings, published in the May 30 issue of The Journal of Neuroscience , suggest that a diet rich in flavonols may help reduce the incidence or severity of neurodegenerative disease or cognitive disorders related to aging. Van Praag and her team compared mice fed a typical diet with those fed a diet supplemented with epicatechin. Half the mice in each group were allowed to run on a wheel for two hours each day. After a month, the mice were trained to find a platform hidden in a pool of water. Those that both exercised and ate the epicatechin diet remembered the location of the platform longer than the other mice. When studying their brains, van Praag and her colleagues found that these mice had greater blood vessel growth in the dentate gyrus and had developed more mature nerve cells, suggesting an enhanced ability of the cells to communicate. Further analysis showed that the epicatechin and exercise combination had a beneficial effect on the expression of genes important for learning and memory, and decreased the activity of genes playing a role in inflammation and neurodegeneration. The researchers found that sedentary mice fed epicatechin showed enhanced memory, blood vessel growth, and gene activity, but these benefits were even more evident in mice that also exercised. "A logical next step will be to study the effects of epicatechin on memory and brain blood flow in aged animals," says van Praag, "and then humans, combined with mild exercise."

Skip to next paragraph Dr. Martin S. Cetron at a news conference in Atlanta Wednesday. Back Story With The Times&#146;s Anahad O’Connor ( TB Patient Is Isolated After Taking Two Flights The man is being detained under a federal isolation order in an Atlanta hospital for treatment of extremely resistant tuberculosis, which is often lethal. American officials and those in many other countries, meanwhile, are seeking to advise more than 100 passengers who sat closest to him on the longest flights and crew members to be tested for the infection. Health officials are also offering testing to hundreds of other passengers on the flights. It was the first airline-contact tracing investigation for extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, and it exposed many flaws that need to be fixed for future episodes, officials of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at a news conference in Atlanta. While many infectious-disease experts and ethicists supported the agency’s action, at least one strongly criticized it as over-reacting. Among the problems the agency identified were dealing with time zone differences; a lack of coordination between American and international authorities concerning how to medically isolate the man while he was abroad; and how to speed the retrieval of passenger manifests from airlines. The episode also raised questions about how rapidly health officials could respond to a similar emergency with other deadly infectious diseases. Even after the news conference, many other questions remained unanswered, including why it took health officials in Georgia so long to try to deliver a letter that explicitly told the man, whose identity was not disclosed, not to fly abroad for his honeymoon. In an interview published yesterday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the man disputed statements from disease agency officials about warnings it said Fulton County officials gave him about flying abroad. The agency said he was told not to fly. The man told the paper that Fulton County health officials said they “preferred” that he not go abroad for his honeymoon and did not advise him to take any precautions. “There are different perspectives on who said what to whom when,” said Dr. Martin S. Cetron, who directs agency’s division of global migration and quarantine. “It is very unfortunate that this whole situation wasn’t prevented” before the man flew with 432 other passengers and 18 crew members to Paris from Atlanta on Air France 385 on May 12, Dr. Cetron said. He took at least five flights within Europe and then flew with 190 other passengers and nine crew members from Prague to Montreal on Czech Air 104 on May 25. The Fulton County health department in Atlanta met with the man and his family on May 10, two days before he flew to Paris, and told them that he should not travel because he had multi-resistant tuberculosis, the disease agency said. No legal order was issued at the time, Dr. Cetron said in referring further questions to the Fulton County health department. Calls to the Fulton County health department yesterday were not returned. The extraordinary dangerous form of the tuberculosis was not detected until May 22, while he was in Europe. Dr. Cetron said that an agency officer telephoned the man in Rome and explicitly told him not to fly on a commercial plane — doctors believe prolonged exposure is needed to spread tuberculosis — while the agency worked out options to bring him back to the United States. They included an air ambulance. By the time a former disease agency doctor, who is working in Rome, arrived at the man’s hotel, the couple had left, Dr. Cetron said. The agency was in the process of putting the man’s name on a no-fly list. But by this time he had cut short his honeymoon that was supposed to last into June and was landing in Montreal. The efforts “weren’t fast enough,” Dr. Cetron said, adding that “we certainly will be learning lessons and looking to improve” current systems. The man drove to the United States and somewhere between Albany and New York spoke with Dr. Cetron, who instructed him on how to continue to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. There, he was isolated for 72 hours until the disease agency flew him in its plane to Atlanta on Monday. The man told the Atlanta paper that tuberculosis was detected by accident when he had a chest X-ray in January for another undisclosed problem.

Ronald Krall, chief medical officer, wrote in the letter that Glaxo did a "meta analysis" similar to the one conducted by Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Steven Nissen, whose article in the New England Journal of Medicine last week linked the drug to a potentially increased risk of heart attacks. Glaxo's own meta-analysis also found indications of increased risk, Dr. Krall wrote, but he said the number of adverse events was low. Dr. Krall also discussed results from two large Glaxo-funded studies of the drug. Neither trial, called Dream and Adopt, was designed primarily to assess the drug's heart risks. But Glaxo's analysis of the Adopt trial showed major adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, were "rare," and heart risks were similar to those of two other diabetes drugs. The Dream trial also showed "no significant difference" in cardiovascular events between the drug and placebo, the letter said. Meanwhile, an independent safety board recently reviewed an interim analysis of an ongoing study, Record, designed specifically to assess the drug's impact on the heart. The board determined the trial should continue, the Glaxo letter said. In an interview, Christopher Viehbacher, Glaxo's president of U.S. pharmaceuticals, said the trial's interim results were "giving us the confidence to say that we stand behind this product." He said there is a chance the interim results will become public before the Record trial is complete, though the trade-off would be that the publicity could weaken the statistical power of the final results. Mr. Viehbacher said it wouldn't surprise the company if the Food and Drug Administration were to call for "some labeling changes" for Avandia. One possibility would be elevating a heart-failure warning on the label to a more severe "black box" warning, he said. Dr. Nissen criticized Glaxo's letter to the Lancet, saying the company was slicing the data differently from the Adopt and Dream results originally published. Dr. Nissen also said the company was referring to such small subsets of data in the Adopt and Dream trials, that no firm conclusion could be drawn. "Somebody went back and looked for something that would support their contention," Dr. Nissen said. "This is not a scientifically proper way to analyze data." Mr. Viehbacher said that after Dr. Nissen's article was published last week, "we were shouting in a gale-force wind blowing against us." Now, he said, the public-relations situation was improving.

Now the European Union has told the food industry it has three years to make its products healthier or it could face stringent new regulations. Several British supermarkets have recently improved nutrional labeling on food products. The EU favors self-regulation by the food industry over legislation in efforts to fight obesity. In the popular European imagination, the bureaucrats of the European Union are seen as constantly interfering in citizens' diets, dictating the acceptable curvature of different classes of bananas and banning so-called "feta" cheese if it's not made in Greece. Now European Union officials are taking new steps to promote healthy eating in the 27-member bloc, warning producers of fatty foods to shape up -- or face regulation. European Union Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou Wednesday issued an ultimatum to Europe's food and drink industry, giving it three years to take action against obesity. "Industry must realize that time is running out if we are to get results at EU level," he told a news conference. "We have given them enough incentive to become more energetic and involved, or risk legislation." The EU wants the food industry to make a bigger effort to cut levels of sugar, fat and salt in processed foods. Kyprianou emphasized, however, that he prefered self-regulation by the industry over legislation, saying he believed it "gets quicker results." The European Commission also unveiled proposals Wednesday for revising nutrition labeling on food products, promoting healthy eating programs, and tightening advertising standards on unhealthy processed food. It also wants sports organizations to encourage youngsters to do more physical exercise.

More than 15 million people in the EU are technically obese or overweight, out of a total population of 490 million, while an estimated 3 million schoolchildren are now obese. The new plans follow the model of an "obesity platform" set up by the European Commission in 2005, which brings industry, consumer groups and health experts together in attempts to combat obesity and which favors self-regulation over a legislative approach. Consumer groups, who have called for a more pro-active approach from Brussels, were critical of the new initiatives. "It seems that the Commission has taken the easy way out by adopting a voluntary approach," said Jim Murray, director of the European consumers' organization BEUC. Unsurprisingly, groups representing the food industry welcomed the plans. "It's not about good and bad food, it's about good and bad diet," said David Zimmer, general secretary of the Association of the Chocolate, Biscuit and Confectionery Industries.

The level of wellness or health is, in part, determined by the ability to deal with and defend against stress. Health is determined by physiological, psychological, socio-cultural, spiritual, and developmental stage variables. Safety alert on Avandia - a timely action of FDA Buy best Avandia products from Amazon Avandia :: Safety alert on Avandia - a timely action of FDA The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety alert on Avandia, diabetes drug approved to treat type 2 diabetes. I believe safety alert on Glaxo's diabetes drug Avandia is a timely action by US FDA health agency, remarked Dr. Anil Singhal. Glaxo defended the drug safety of its diabetes drug Avandia saying "The suggestion that GlaxoSmithKline has placed patients at risk and attempted to silence independent investigation of data is absolutely false. Any fair examination of the company’s record will show that GSK has been fully transparent in its efforts to thoroughly study the safety and effectiveness of Avandia, and to widely communicate that information to governments, scientists, physicians, and the public in the best interests of both patients and scientific debate." GSK strongly disagrees with the conclusions reached in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) article, which are based on incomplete evidence and a methodology that the author admits has significant limitations. Avandia was approved in 1999 for treatment of type 2 diabetes, a serious and life thr eatening disease that affects about 18 to 20 million Americans and more than 70 million people worldwide. Diabetes is a leading cause of coronary heart disease, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Since the drug was approved, FDA has been monitoring several heart-related adverse events (e.g., fluid retention, edema and congestive heart failure) based on signals seen in previous controlled clinical trials of Avandia alone and in combination with other drugs, and from postmarketing reports. Just to hide Avandia's risk factors, Glaxo published a clinical study in late 2006, appreciating Avandia's clinical safety and performance in reducing blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients. Because of inadequate warnings about Avandia and massive advertising campaigns, its popularity has grown so that 11 million prescriptions were filled for the drug in the United States in 2006 alone. According to the American College of Cardiology, American Diabetes Association and American Heart Association, this NEJM study deserves serious thought and follow-up. As estimated here, the overall level of the risk associated with rosiglitazone appears to be small, but nonetheless one that must be considered carefully. In the meantime, patients using this drug should talk to their health care provider to determine the most appropriate course of action. Patients should not stop taking any prescribed medications without first discussing the issue with their health care provider. Further research will be needed in this area to provide conclusive evidence.

Surgery may benefit those with back pain: studies Updated Thu. May. 31 2007 10:52 AM ET Slipped disks and sciatica -- two of the most common causes of back problems -- can see more improvement with prompt surgery than with non-surgical remedies, two new studies in the New England Journal of Medicine One study looked at 283 patients with sciatica, a painful condition caused by displaced spinal disks putting pressure on the sciatic nerve, causing painful burning sensations or numbness. The condition resolves itself on its own without surgery about 75 per cent of the time. The patients underwent randomization either to early surgery (microdiskectomy) or to treatment of physical therapy and drugs, using surgery only if needed. Thirty-nine per cent of the 142 patients who were referred for conservative treatment had surgery after an average of 18.7 weeks. At a one-year follow-up, 95 per cent of all sciatica patients were free of pain whether they had surgery or not. There were no significant differences between the groups in pain, disability, and recovery scores. But the early-surgery group experienced quicker pain relief and a faster rate of self-perceived recovery. The second study looked at cases of slipped vertebra or slipped disk -- called degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis -- a condition in which one or more vertebra become misaligned and press on nerves in the spinal cord, resulting in leg pains. It generally occurs after the age of 50 and is seen six times more often in women than in men. The study, led by researchers at the Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire, found that surgery was twice as effective as non-surgical approaches in reducing pain and restoring functionality for patients. The study recruited 607 patients from 11 U.S. states who had at least 12 weeks of symptoms confirmed as DS. They were assigned to either a randomized cohort or an observational cohort. The results showed that 372 patients had surgery within two years (decompressive laminectomy, with or without fusion) and 235 had non-surgical treatments that included physical therapy, steroid injections, and pain relievers. Two years later, patients who had received surgical treatment reported significantly reduced pain and improved functionality as early as six weeks after intervention. Those who did not receive surgery reported only modest improvements. Although the study was designed to look at a randomized and an observational cohort, fully 40 per cent of participants who had been randomized later switched groups, resulting in substantial crossover between surgical and non-surgical groups. The authors chose to publish the results based on what treatment was actually received in each group. An accompanying editorial concludes: "Absent major neurologic deficits, patients with herniated disks, degenerative spondylolisthesis, or spinal stenosis do not need surgery, but the appropriate surgical procedures may provide valuable pain relief. "In such situations, decisions should be made jointly by well-informed patients and their physicians."

A study found that women who snacked on the superfood up to four times a day saw their levels of “bad” cholesterol drop, and they also had healthier blood pressure readings. Soy nuts, which are similar to peanuts, are made from whole soya beans soaked in water and baked. Researchers in Boston, USA, recruited 60 post­menopausal women with blood pressures ranging from healthy to high. Half were asked to follow a diet getting 30 per cent of calories from fat, 15 per cent from protein and 55 per cent from carbohydrates. It also included two portions per week of oily fish and 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. The other women were told to adopt the same diet but replace 25 grammes of the protein with half a cup of soy nuts a day. After eight weeks, those with high blood pressure who ate nuts saw their top systolic blood pressure drop by almost 10 per cent. Low diastolic readings dropped by an average 6.8 per cent. Soy contains isoflavones, also thought to ward off osteoporosis and protect against breast and colon cancer. &#9679;Pregnant women are warned to take iron supplements only if they are anaemic because they can raise blood pressure and result in smaller babies.

First Read is updated throughout the day, so check back often. , NBC Political Director , NBC Deputy Political Director How they roll (out) Posted: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 4:24 PM by Mark Murray From NBC's Carrie Dann In the wake of Obama's big policy pitch yesterday, the worlds of print and pixel are crowded with side-by-side comparisons of the Democratic front-runners' plans for universal health care reform. It's certainly worthwhile to parse the details of the three plans -- their costs, their options, and their requirements. But there's something to be said for zooming out from the play-by-play to look at how each of the heavy hitters choose to present their big policy plans. And there's even a lot to learn by just hitting the "mute" button (and not for the reasons that their GOP rivals might enthusiastically suggest). Since hitting the trail in earnest, each of the top three Democratic candidates have touted rollouts on health care, the economy, and a handful of other sweeping topics. Each has addressed a tough topic on friendly turf. ( talked foreign policy in hometown Chicago; talked about health-care costs a stone's throw away from the Capitol Dome; and Southerner unveiled his big health-care plan in Charleston, SC.) Other than the locale, a catchy phrase -- preferably two words -- is a key component to the "major policy address." Compare Obama's Rockwellian "American Moment" to Clinton's risky "Shared Prosperity," which set GOP blogs ablaze yesterday with allusions to Red China. Unsurprisingly, the meticulous Clinton outlines her plans like an infomercial ad wizard; her economic plan was nine steps, and her talk about health care was seven. And it's worth noting that Clinton and Obama tend to stay entrenched behind podiums for the heavy lifting, while Edwards broke the mold by introducing his health-care plan in a town-hall format and by fielding questions after his health-care rollout. Every new health care reform plan proposed would just jam the system. The only plan good would be to scrap the entire system and go for universal health care. But then, the media would start pushing out the false nightmarish stories of health system of Canada and Britain, without mentioning that among all developed nations US has the lowest life expectancy (77.4) while Canada's is 80.0 and UK's is 78.4, and US spends the most in percentage (15%) of its GNP for its health care system. And also the per capita spending on health in US is 5117 (the highest among all the nations), compared to 2998 in canada and 2317 in UK. Where does all this money goes, in the coffers of the insurance companies and their officers. The health care system of this country is nothing but a fraud. What we want in this country are more educated people, people who are willing to form their opinions based on real facts, not people who would rather have decisions made for them by the corporations and their political and media stooges. (Sent Wednesday, May 30, 2007 9:08 PM) MM,MA. What is your proof of the "false, nightmarish stories"? Please clarify, because unlike yourself I am willing to bet I have seen socialized medicine up close and personal. And it is indeed a nightmare. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 6:12 AM) A nightmare is when you don't have health insurance and make too much money to get any government help, and you don't make enouph money to pay $1500.00 a day for a hospital stay. Or maybe $20,000.00 for a surgery. Sell you home and everything you have. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:52 AM) In Europe workers are taxed anywhere from 49-51 percent of their income to provide "free" medical care and they still wait months to get into see a doctor who has been working 14-16 hours. I don't see how people think that is such a great system. Unless of course you are one of the â€œaustlandarsâ€ (Russians, Poles, Turks, ect), who donâ€™t work and pay taxes. Europe, Germany in particular can not keep up with the mounting costs of "free" health care, free education, free child care, ect, and there is a tax payer revolt coming. Europeâ€™s â€œfreeâ€ health care is failing. What makes Hillarity or Obama think Sorosâ€™ dream of socialized health care is going to work for the US? I'm telling you I am seeing it first hand everyday, and do matter how good they make it sound, it is a crappy, expensive, system that will dummy health care down to it's lowest possible denominator. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 10:36 AM) Rick, Germany, Maybe you are right. you are experiencing it , I'm not. I do know that something has to change here. This system is no longer working. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 11:23 AM) Not working, and WAY TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE! My girlfriend just had a D&C done after an planned pregnancy that aborted itself. The entire procedure took less than 20 minutes, but cost $6500.00, and with 3 people in the room! What a RIPOFF!!!!! I Want To Make $6,000 per Hour, Too.... (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 11:55 AM) Amazing, how the multimillionaires can talk about "free" or socialized medical care when they will never have to use it. No, they will never have to wait for months to get an appointment or wait for an available hospital bed. The answer is for more affordable care. I have insurance, but for what I get and what I pay, it is still very, very expensive. I recently had an accident and still ended up paying (out-of-pocket) a fortune for the difference between "acceptable to the insurance company" and what the hospital charged. Everyone should be eligible for affordable insurance. A relative recently was declared disabled and was put on Medicaid. When he got his statement, there were "discounts" given because of the medicaid. Apparently, there is difference in what medicaid patients and someone with insurance is charged-a big difference.

According to Science Daily , scientists in Auckland, New Zealand, have bred a skim-milk producing cow successfully. In addition to producing milk that is skim, the milk from this cow also has other benefits. Plans are in the making for creating herds of this type of cow, now that research shows it can be done. ViaLactia, the biotech firm responsible for breeding the cow, says it will target health-conscious consumers with their marketing campaigns. In addition to the milk being naturally skim (low in fat content), the milk also has other benefits. It has a normal level of protein, differing from skim milk that is manufactured. Russel Snell, the chief scientist at ViaLactia told UPI ( quoted on Science Daily ) about the original cow "She produces a normal level of protein in her milk but substantially less fat, and the fat she does produce has much more unsaturated fat. She also produces milk with very high levels of omega3 oils." Protein is essential for hair and nails. They are made up of mostly protein. All cells require protein. It is used to build tissue and also to repair it. Protein is used in making enzymes, hormones, and other essential body chemicals. This milk could also be great for heart health because according to the , "Replacing some carbohydrates with protein and unsaturated fat may enhance heart health benefits". The Omega3 Oils, usually found in fish and soy products, are also heart healthy. These oils are highly recommended by the The original cow was found by ViaLactia in 2001, but it was recently evidenced that she passed the skim-milk producing trait on to her calves. With this success, it is a marketable product as the calves can then also be bred to create a herd, which in turn could create more and more of these skim-milk producing cows in accordance with product demand. Snell says "You have to generate daughters and then they have to carry a calf and deliver milk. The eureka moment was when we found her daughters produced milk like their mother."

Parirenyatwa and Harare hospitals in the capital and Mpilo and Bulawayo central hospitals in Bulawayo have closed most departments, leaving only the casualty wings, and are operating with skeleton staff, as health professionals and aides fail to turn up for work due to low salaries. Sources at the government hospitals said the situation was worsening every week, with no sign of a solution in sight. Officials said the maternity wing at Parirenyatwa Hospital was closed last weekend, compelling expectant mothers to turn to expensive private hospitals. Many more, however, have resorted to fly-by-night maternity homes in the high-density suburbs, where sanitary conditions are said to be appalling. Edwin Muguti, the deputy Health Minister, admitted the situation at hospitals was critical. But he insisted the government was working to minimise inconveniencing patients. "There has been no improvement since the workers stopped coming to work. But we are trying our best to keep the hospitals open and fully functional," said Muguti. "We are doing something for the workers, including nurses and doctors, but we fear our efforts as far as awarding better salaries and working conditions are concerned are being eroded by inflation. The problem is the economic difficulties we are facing." Angry stakeholders who called The Financial Gazette yesterday reported that staff at Parirenyatwa and Harare hospitals were only attending to emergencies. The situation in Harare has been compounded by the closure of almost all municipal clinics due to a lack of personnel, drugs and equipment. In Bulawayo, the situation at Mpilo Central Hospital was yesterday reported to be serious. A skeleton staff consisting entirely of trainees was said to be attending to emergency cases. Things were no different at Bulawayo Central Hospital. In February, the government tried to mollify health workers by announcing two salary increments within a month after a crippling six-week strike. Nurses were awarded an additional $263 000 on top of their improved January salaries of $195 000, bringing their monthly earnings to between $458 000 and $500 000. Wards visited by this newspaper at Parirenyatwa and Harare hospitals yesterday were deserted, with nurse aides, administration and general staff having stayed away. Health Minister David Parirenyatwa admitted earlier this month that health workers could no longer afford bus fares to and from work. On a salary of $500 000, a nurse needs to pay an average of $840 000 in bus fares per month. &copy; 2007 Financial Gazette. All rights reserved. Distributed by AllAfrica Global Media ( ).

Barack Obama (D-IL) at a May campaign stop in New Orleans. Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) speaks with supporters during a meeting at the Lincoln Elementary School in Charles City, Iowa. May 29, 2007 &middot; Health care is taking center stage in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. In Iowa City on Tuesday, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to provide health coverage to every American. Obama's speech comes just days after rival Sen. Hillary Clinton presented the first part of her health plan at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. If Obama's plan to cover everyone &mdash; which he's been promising since January &mdash; has a familiar ring to it, it may be because it borrows from a long list of Democratic plans of the past, including those put forward by President Clinton, as well as the last two Democratic presidential nominees, former Vice President Al Gore and Massachusetts senator John Kerry. Among other things, it would expand public insurance programs for the poor, provide subsidies for private insurance for the middle class, and create a health-insurance exchange to oversee the private insurance market. "If you are one of the 45 million Americans who don't have health insurance, after this plan becomes law, you will have health insurance available to you," he said in a speech at the University of Iowa. "No one will be turned away because of a pre-existing condition or illness. Everyone will be able buy into a new health insurance plan that's similar to the one that every federal employee &mdash; from a postal worker in Iowa to a congressman in Washington &mdash; currently has for themselves." Obama would pay for his plan in a variety of ways: by letting President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy expire; by requiring most businesses to pay a share of worker premiums; and by focusing on prevention and wringing inefficiencies out of the current system. That latter part is almost identical to the seven-point cost-cutting plan laid out last week by fellow candidate and senator Hillary Clinton. "The money we save from the waste we eliminate and the way we change how we care for people should be used to help finance coverage for the 45 million Americans who have no insurance," Clinton told an audience of mostly health professionals at George Washington University. "Also, when you insure everyone, it will maximize the impact of the prevention programs I have recommended &mdash; with early care as opposed to emergency care &mdash; as well as cutting administrative costs," she said. Clinton's speech last week focused solely on costs. She said future speeches will address health care quality and insurance coverage for all Americans. But Clinton and Obama aren't the only Democratic candidates with full-scale health plans. Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards put out his plan to cover everyone in February. Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich is a longtime sponsor of the so-called single-payer plan that would have the government replace private insurance. Harvard School of Public Health professor Robert Blendon says he would be surprised if the Democratic candidates weren't talking a lot about health care. "To Democratic primary voters, health care is the core of what it means to be a Democrat," he said. "They really think today that government has to do something to help them with their situation." Republican primary voters, by contrast, tend to worry more about taxes and security. Which may help explain the peculiar case of former Massachusetts Republican governor Mitt Romney. He rarely talks about health care on the GOP presidential campaign trail. Yet he signed the bipartisan health coverage law that's now the basis for many of the national Democrats' plans. Meanwhile, Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, says all the big health plans being offered by the Democrats may in the end just cancel one another out. While experts will be able to see the differences between each candidate's plan for information technology or chronic disease management, voters will likely just note that each candidate has a big health plan. "And if any candidate gains an edge on health, I think it will be the candidate that convinces the voters that they can finally forge a consensus that can finally get something done and get something passed in the Congress," Altman says. Of course, that assumes the public will prefer the Democrats' approach to the more free-market approach to health care that's likely to be pushed by the Republican nominee. &#187; Up to twelve addresses, separated by commas.

Jackie Calmes, Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON -- During the 13 years since President Bill Clinton lost his bid to remake the U.S. health-care system, and helped cost his party control of Congress in the bargain, politicians have shied from changing it more than one step at a time even as costs and the ranks of uninsured have ballooned. Now, the growing list of Democratic presidential candidates calling for universal, cheaper coverage -- Illinois Sen. Barack Obama yesterday became the latest -- suggests the days of health-care incrementalism are over. Nor are these Democrats alone in embracing the once-toxic political cause of universal care: The best-known state models have been championed by Republican governors, including Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who is now running for president. This shift reflects rising and inflation-topping out-of-pocket costs for health care and insurance premiums, co-payments and deductibles. Also, the number of uninsured has spiked to about 45 million, from 37 million when Mr. Clinton was president. Business leaders increasingly are seeking a government-imposed solution, saying employee health costs put them at a disadvantage with foreign competitors. Those forces, in turn, have combined to embolden politicians in both parties to once again propose universal health care that inevitably would mean a big role for government -- and possibly upend the powerful insurance, medical and pharmaceutical industries. Mr. Obama's speech unveiling his initiative in Iowa, the state with the first nominating contest, comes a week after Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York proposed health-cost savings as an integral part of a later plan specifically aimed at covering uninsured Americans. The third candidate in Democrats' top tier of White House contenders, former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, beat both to the punch with a detailed universal-coverage plan in early February. In Congress, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Bob Bennett of Utah have drafted a bill to overhaul the nation's health system. It isn't expected to get off the ground during the current Congress and the remainder of George Bush's presidency, though, given the president's belief in market forces and opposition to government regulation. Moreover, he and the Democrat-led Congress are locked in battle over Iraq. The public likewise is preoccupied with war, polls show, but health care has re-emerged as voters' top domestic concern. Indeed, the political center on the issue seems to have shifted so much that the health-insurance industry, which undermined the Clinton plan with commercials featuring middle-class couple "Harry and Louise" ridiculing the big bureaucracy it would create, openly supports a federal role in universal coverage. The industry strategy is to shape the result rather than to fight it. Mohit Ghose, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the successor group to the one that fought the Clintons, yesterday said, "The most important thing for us is that there are plans out there." The group's own proposal for universal health care, unveiled after Democrats won control of Congress, focuses on increasing federal subsidies for insurance, and avoids new mandates or regulations. The Republican Party also is adjusting to voters' openness to a government role in making health-care more affordable and accessible, with the goal of putting its imprint on any changes. "Republicans have an opportunity to lead on health care by promoting broad-based reform consistent with our principles: consumer choice, market incentives, technology," said former Republican Party Chairman Ken Mehlman. Republican candidates nonetheless will likely try to blast Democrats for using universal care to boost the size of government and to raise taxes. But they have yet to engage: The Web site of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani doesn't list health care among his top 10 issues. Big employers, while eager for help with the growing burden of employee health costs, are reserving judgment on early proposals. The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives that recently joined with the seniors organization AARP and the service-employees union to press for a bipartisan solution, issued a statement welcoming Mr. Obama's effort "to focus the nation's attention on this critical issue." Despite the renewed interest in taking on health care, though, no one is talking about an overhaul as ambitious as the 1993-94 Clinton plan -- not even its architect, Mr. Clinton's wife. The Clintons proposed a complex and heavily regulated system based on a mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees, and the creation of powerful insurance-purchasing agencies as go-betweens for consumers and health providers. Now, as Mrs. Clinton campaigns for president, a staple of her speeches is a self-deprecating nod to the scars she bears from that fight -- and assurance that, as she puts it, "I know what not to do." For one thing, Mrs. Clinton says this time she will seek consensus before moving ahead. While her preference, and that of many Democratic voters, would be a Medicare-style plan for all, she tells audiences it wouldn't be possible to get such a system passed in Congress. Both the Obama and Edwards plans would work within the current private-insurance system, and mandate that all but the smallest employers either provide health coverage to their workers, or contribute to a pool for the uninsured. But unlike Mr. Edwards, Mr. Obama wouldn't mandate that individuals purchase insurance. Given that option, both the Edwards and Clinton camps said the Obama plan wouldn't achieve universal coverage as advertised, since many Americans -- especially the healthy and young -- won't buy policies unless required to do so, thereby keeping premiums and other costs higher. Obama advisers insisted that as the cost-saving proposals in his plan in turn reduce the costs of insurance, individuals would buy it; if a President Obama found after several years that some share of Americans remained uninsured, "he'd revisit" the issue, they said. At the same time, the Obama aides questioned whether Mr. Edwards's plan would accomplish universal coverage; they cited his plan's caveat that individuals wouldn't be mandated to have insurance until it becomes affordable. To help pay for their plans, both Messrs. Obama and Edwards would end the Bush tax cuts for the rich, typically said to be those making more than $200,000 a year. That would translate into revenue upward of $65 billion a year, depending on which cuts are eliminated. Under the Obama plan, the federal government would cover some costs for catastrophic illnesses that account for a huge share of expenses. The senator said this would lead to reduced premiums. He also would mandate that all children be insured, and would expand both Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program to cover more poor families. States would be able to continue implementing their own plans, as long as they met new minimum coverage standards. People up to age 25 could continue to be covered under parents' policies. Mr. Obama would create a National Health Insurance Exchange, described in campaign documents as "a watchdog group" that would be empowered to set rules and standards "to make individual coverage more affordable and accessible." While now more willing to accept a government role than they were a decade ago, insurers, as well as pharmaceutical companies, aren't likely to support his proposal any more than they did the 1994 Clinton plan that Republicans still deride as "Hillary-Care." And Mr. Obama, despite his reputation as someone who brings all sides together, yesterday repeatedly lambasted both industries for profiteering and killing all past attempts at change. "It's time to bring together businesses, the medical community, and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis, and it's time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while they'll get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair," Mr. Obama said. Aside from insurers and drug makers, losers would include the wealthiest Americans who would forfeit their tax cuts. Winners, supporters say, would be the 45 million uninsured, as well as everyone else who would see lower health costs. Mr. Obama claimed a family of four on average would save $2,500 a year. To help bring down costs, all three Democratic candidates aim to have insurers cover more preventive care to avert expensive illnesses. And they would have the government subsidize health providers' investments in technology, which they claim could squeeze out big savings, though some experts question how much.

But Glaxo later fought back, persuading UK medical journal to publish a letter online today which stressed that an on-going long term detailed study of Avandia - known as ADOPT- had so far shown that the risks of heart problems with Avandia were no worse that those with two other drugs used for diabetes. The shares at first lost 29p to &pound;12.27, making a total loss in the past few days of &pound;2.30 per share, or &pound;13.3 billion - 13 per cent of market value - but bounced back in afternoon trading once Glaxo publicised its letter and ended up 22p at 1328p. Avandia is Glaxo's No 2 best selling medicine after the asthma drug Advair, but Glaxo has now lost more than &pound;13 billion in value or 13 per cent in the past nine days since research published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that Avandia increased the risks of heart attack by 43 per cent and the risks of death by other causes by 64 per cent, although the leading cardiologist behind the research, Dr Steven Nissen, acknowledged that more studies are needed. Glaxo comment: More pain Sales of Glaxo's diabetes drug nosedive &lsquo;I was truly frightened on behalf of our patients&rsquo; Merrill Lynch told clients this morning in a that while it concurs with the view that Avandia's heart attack risks are scientifically questionable, the resultant publicity will further hurt sales of the drug and Glaxo's share price. "The overhang to both Avandia sales and GSK share price is likely to remain for the forseeable future." said analyst Graham Parry. He cut forecast earnings per share for 2008 by 2 per cent and by 7 per cent for 2012. He said the concerns raised were unlikely to be either firmly refuted or proven until the publication of a key safety study in 2009. "In the intervening period, the stock will likely remain under pressure as both Avandia safety and Glaxo's reputiaton are placed under intense public scrutiny." Congressional hearings are set for June 6 and there will be a hearing before the Food and Drug Administration panel in July or August. Yesterday broker Deutsche Bank cited a report by pharmaceutical research firm , which showed that Avandia's market share of new prescription had fallen from 10 per cent to around zero in two days after the article was published. Deutsche said: "While two days of prescription data cannot be regarded as a rigorous test of clinician sentiment to the NEJM article...this reaction is far worse than we had anticipated and suggests that there could be as much as 22 per cent downside risk to GSK's near term earnings." Glaxo has said that its own studies, shared with regulators, were more detailed than Dr Nissen's research and showed no greater risk of heart attacks than rival drugs or placebos. It also said yesterday that two days of sales data was not enough to establish a trend. * Town / City Save to my times GlaxoSmithKline defends Avandia as shares drop 13% in nine days The bigger they are, the bigger the side-effects MPs poised to intervene in Boots pension row Also in Industry Sectors Hungry Blackstone pays &pound;140m for Strada Kwik Save to meet union officials BP's criticised refining head John Manzoni quits Government to raise &pound;2.2bn from British Energy Chinese tax move sends markets lower BP: from hate to love in Russia Special Report by Peter Koenig on how Lord Browne bet all on a Russian bandit Your Browser doesn't support Inline frames Find out who has joined the club with the &pound;70 million entrance fee Your Browser doesn't support Inline frames Tailor-made section with features and news for the Business Traveller Overseas contacts and local information for your business Keep up with the coming week's key events She relied on an oxygen machine.

The FDA approval was based on the results of a clinical trial published today in the New England Journal of Medicine The trial showed that patients who were given Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival of about three and a half months compared with patients who were only on interferon. Torisel belongs to a class of drugs that inhibit enzymes that control the production, growth and survival of cells. More specifically, it inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase, commonly known as mTOR, a protein kinase that controls cell growth, proliferation, motility, and survival. mTOR also regulates protein synthesis and transcription. Director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Dr Steven Galson said: "We have made significant advances in the battle against kidney cancer." "Torisel is the third drug approved for this indication in the past 18 months, and one that shows an increased time in survival for some patients," he added. In December 2005 the FDA approved sorafenib (Bayer's Nexavar), followed by sunitinib (Pfizer's Sutent) in January 2006. The Torisel multicentre phase 3 trial took 626 patients and randomly assigned them to three groups. One group was given Torisel alone, another was given interferon alfa (Roche's Roferon-A) and the third group received Torisol and interferon combined. None of the patients had been treated before the trial and they had all received a poor prognosis for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma. The median overall survival for patients receiving Torisel alone was 10.9 months compared with 7.3 months for those who received only the interferon. Also, progression-free survival in the Torisel alone group was 5.5 months compared to 3.1 months in the interferon alone gruop. The Torisel and interferon combined group did not show a significant increase in overall survival compared to the interferon alone group. The researchers concluded that: "As compared with interferon alfa, temsirolimus improved overall survival among patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma and a poor prognosis. The addition of temsirolimus to interferon did not improve survival." The most common side effects among the Torisel patients included rash, fatigue, nausea, edema, loss of appetite and mouth sores. This occurred in at least 30 per cent of the patients who received the drug. The most common abnormalities as shown by laboratory tests included high levels of blood sugar, lipids and triglycerides, plus elevated kidney and liver blood tests, with lower than normal red cell, white cell and blood platelet counts. Renal cell carcinoma accounts for around 85 per cent of the 51,000 people affected by adult kidney cancer in the US every year.

The infant, weighing between one to three pounds died from bacteremia - commonly known as blood poisoning - after acquiring serratia, a harmful pathogen that causes severe infections in babies, a hospital spokesperson said. The hospital's level 3 neonatal unit, where the most fragile babies are admitted, was closed Wednesday night while level 2 was reopened. Special infection control procedures are in place in the rest of the neonatal ward,Â including improved hand hygiene and the wearing of gowns and gloves.

Marge has been identified in a herd in New Zealand by scientists who are trying to revolutionize the dairy industry. They want cows that produce low-fat milk and butter that spreads straight from the fridge. So they're thrilled about Marge, the Guardian newspaper science correspondent reports this week. Marge's milk is low in saturated fat and high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat. Scientists figure they can get a whole herd of Marges by 2011. Who's behind this hunt for low-cal cows? The biotech company ViaLactia, which set their scientists the task of screening milk from its own herd of 4 million cows. ViaLactia is a subsidiary of New Zealand's largest dairy co-op and the world's largest exporter of dairy products. Which explains their bias about cows.

Investors took comfort in news and in the company bounced off two- year lows to end higher on the day. Before recovering late this afternoon, the had lost 13 pct in the wake of safety fears prompted by an article earlier this week in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), erasing 9 bln stg from the company's market value. A pooled or meta-analysis of data from 42 clinical trials concluded that Avandia increased the risk of heart attack by 43 pct, and cardiac related death by 64 pct. While the authors admitted that the methodology has significant limitations, an editorial in the journal called for regulators to withdraw the drug, Glaxo's second-biggest selling product. Europe's biggest drug maker has always strongly disagreed with the findings, and today published new evidence in a letter to The Lancet. Glaxo's chief medical officer Ronald Krall pointed out that the NEJM's analysis omitted the total percentage number of events. The number of heart attacks happened at a very low frequency, 0.6 pct for both Avandia and control groups. He added that further analyses from two long-term clinical trials, conducted since the article was published, showed that the incidence of cardiovascular events with Avandia is comparable to the two gold standard medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes, and to a placebo pill. Meanwhile, findings from a soon-to-be-published study, using a database of more than 30,000 diabetes patients, show the incidence of hospitalisations for heart attack or heart surgery for patients on Avandia is the same as for other diabetes treatments, the company announced. Glaxo has been conducting a large long-term study to specifically study the risk of heart attack associated with the drug since 2002, which will report in 2009. A safety monitoring board reviewed an interim analysis of the data, and determined that the study should be allowed to continue, Krall pointed out today. The Food and Drug Administration will review the drug in the next few months and the company faces a congressional hearing in the US on June 6. Concerns that the furore will prevent doctors from prescribing the treatment to new patients has prompted many analysts to downgrade sales and Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock to 'sell' from 'neutral' today, saying that it only sees 'downside' as a result of the concerns, and forecast no near-term growth in the product. Fears of potential litigation by patients have also contributed to the stock's decline. However other brokers, such as Collins Stewart, have retained 'buy' recommendations and believe the fall has been overdone. The Lancet itself has already publicly highlighted the drawbacks to the NEJM study, and called for a 'calmer and more considered' approach. Analyst Paul Diggle at Nomura Code Securities, which has also kept a 'buy' rating on Glaxo, said the reaffirmation of the data this afternoon likely helped the stock recover. And the reassurance from another party, not just financial analysts, that the situation has been overblown may have provided some comfort. 'The Lancet clearly doesn't feel particularly happy with the way the New England Journal reported it, and the combination of having another journal cast aspersions on what the New England Journal has done, plus Glaxo reaffirming the data, has helped,' he commented. Glaxo shares closed at 1,328, 22 pence or 1.7 pct higher. The stock fell to 1,269 earlier. Copyright AFX News Limited 2007. All rights reserved.

POSTED: 3:42 pm EDT May 28, 2007 UPDATED: 3:55 pm EDT May 28, 2007 Applying sunscreen to your body isn't the only way to protect yourself from skin cancer. Some dermatologists say you can also drink your way to healthy skin. Drinking just one cup of tea a day can lower your risk of getting the two most common types of skin cancer, squamous and basal cell carcinoma, reported the Journal of the American Academy Of Dermatology. In a study of more than 2,000 people, tea's antioxidants were found to limit the effects of the sun's ultraviolet rays. It doesn't matter if the tea is hot or cold, and all types of tea offered protection. But doctors warn that tea isn't the cure-all. Remember to cover up and wear sunscreen. . All rights reserved.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Obama Says Washington Is Ready for Health Plan Anne E. Kornblut and Perry Bacon Jr. Washington Post Staff Writers Wednesday, May 30, 2007; Page A05 IOWA CITY, May 29 -- ) echoed familiar Democratic themes on Tuesday in calling on businesses, insurance companies and lawmakers to reject the "failed politics" of past debates and overhaul the nation's health-care system to cover every American. Obama, who is among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, offered few new ideas in laying out his plan to expand health insurance and to greatly reduce health-care costs. Instead, he cast his proposal in the themes that have defined his candidacy: optimism and a desire to move beyond partisan politics. He offered ideas that have long been proposed to solve one of the country's most vexing problems: increasing subsidies for those who cannot afford insurance but do not qualify for public programs, spending more federal money on disease prevention and making health records electronic.

Save & Share Article "We now face an opportunity -- and an obligation -- to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterday's health-care debates," Obama told a crowd of medical professionals. "It's time to bring together businesses, the medical community and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis, and it's time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while they'll get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair." Referring to the failed effort of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ), one of his 2008 campaign rivals, to reform health care in the early 1990s, Obama said that achievements nationwide in recent years by Democratic and Republican governors show that expanding health care is no longer too politically dangerous. "We can do this," he said. "The climate is far different than it was the last time we tried this, in the early '90s." The proposal, part of a series of speeches Obama has given over the past several weeks after he faced criticism from some party activists for speaking too much about his popular themes of hope and optimism rather than policy plans, in many ways resembles the ideas of some of his challengers. It comes as all the Democratic candidates, looking for advantage in a tight primary contest, are trying to find ideas that will connect best with liberals who want to see more aggressive action in expanding health care and ending the war in ), who outlined his health-care goals in February, Obama would pay for his plan, which could cost more than $50 billion, by increasing taxes for people earning more than $250,000 and reversing tax cuts that approved. Obama would require almost all employers to offer insurance to workers or face a tax penalty, an idea that many businesses abhor and that is also in Edwards's proposal. This employer mandate drove much of the opposition to the Clinton plan in 1994. Like Clinton, who in a speech last week laid out some of her health-care ideas, Obama is focused as much on reducing the costs for those who are insured as on expanding coverage to the estimated 45 million Americans who are not. He called for the federal government to pay part of the costs for patients with chronic illnesses, so that employers would not have to do so, but also emphasized the importance of preventive care. It is important to "listen to our wives when they tell us to stop smoking," he said, referring to his own unhealthy habit. Like many Democratic politicians, he blamed drug and health insurance companies for stopping the passage of more expansive health-care proposals. The lack of new ideas in Obama's health plan in part reflects his approach. He has emphasized his freshness as a rationale for his candidacy, but that freshness has been much more about his tone and his rhetoric about hope and bipartisanship than his policy proposals, which have largely mirrored those of his 2008 rivals and the ideas that Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) offered in the 2004 presidential race. One concept that Obama's plan does not include is a popular idea from both Democrats and Republicans who work on health-care issues: an "individual mandate" that would require every American to buy health insurance. A landmark plan that was approved in last year made such a requirement, and without it, health experts say, Obama's plan is unlikely to create universal health coverage, although his advisers estimated that it would provide insurance to almost all Americans. Edwards's proposal calls for such a mandate and Clinton is likely to include it in hers as well, her advisers said. Obama would require only that all children have health coverage. The Clinton and Edwards campaigns quickly criticized Obama for not offering a plan that would require insurance for all. "Any plan that does not cover all Americans is simply inadequate," said Mark Kornblau, an Edwards spokesman. Obama's advisers argued that such a mandate is less important than adding subsidies and other ways to make health care more affordable. The senator's aides estimated that his plan would save the average family $2,500 per year and would allow those without insurance to buy it through a new health-care option that would resemble the one federal employees can choose. They said it would create a national health entity from which people could buy private insurance plans. "The key is not the mandate," said David Cutler, an economics professor at , who advised Obama on the plan. "It's the affordability and the accessibility." Obama's allies described his proposal as far-reaching and achievable. Obama made a similar argument, telling the crowd in that voters are tired of candidates who "offer up detailed health-care plans with great fanfare and promise, only to see them crushed under the weight of Washington politics and drug-insurance-industry lobbying once the campaign is over." Bacon reported from Washington. Staff writer in Washington contributed to this report.

The American Heart Association estimates that high blood pressure (hypertension) affects approximately 50 million Americans and 1 billion individuals worldwide. The most common-and deadly-result is coronary heart disease, according to background information in the article. Women with high blood pressure have four times the risk of heart disease as women with normal blood pressure. Francine K. Welty, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, assigned 60 healthy post-menopausal women to eat two diets for eight weeks each in random order. The first diet, the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet, consisted of 30 percent of calories from fat (with 7 percent or less from saturated fat), 15 percent from protein and 55 percent from carbohydrates; 1,200 milligrams of calcium per day; two meals of fatty fish (such as salmon or tuna) per week; and less than 200 milligrams of cholesterol per day. The other diet had the same calorie, fat and protein content, but the women were instructed to replace 25 grams of protein with one-half cup of unsalted soy nuts. Blood pressure and blood samples for cholesterol testing were taken at the beginning and end of each eight-week period. According to Eurekalert, the news service of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at the beginning of the study, 12 women had high blood pressure (140/90 milligrams of mercury or higher) and 48 had normal blood pressure. "Soy nut supplementation significantly reduced systolic [top number] and diastolic [bottom number] blood pressure in all 12 hypertensive women and in 40 of the 48 normotensive women," the authors write. "Compared with the TLC diet alone, the TLC diet plus soy nuts lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure 9.9 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively, in hypertensive women and 5.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, in normotensive women." In women with high blood pressure, the soy diet also decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein ("bad") cholesterol by an average of 11 percent and levels of apoliprotein B (a particle that carries bad cholesterol) by an average of 8 percent. Cholesterol levels remained the same in women with normal blood pressure. "A 12-millimeter of mercury decrease in systolic blood pressure for 10 years has been estimated to prevent one death for every 11 patients with stage one hypertension treated; therefore, the average reduction of 15 milligrams of mercury in systolic blood pressure in hypertensive women in the present study could have significant implications for reducing cardiovascular risk and death on a population basis," the authors write. "This study was performed in the free-living state; therefore, dietary soy may be a practical, safe and inexpensive modality to reduce blood pressure. If the findings are repeated in a larger group they may have important implications for reducing cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women on a population basis," they conclude.

Washington, D.C. - infoZine - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Torisel (temsirolimus) for the treatment of a certain type of advanced kidney cancer known as renal cell carcinoma. Torisel was approved based on a study that showed use of the drug prolonged survival of patients with renal cell carcinoma. The drug is an enzyme inhibitor, a protein that regulates cell production, cell growth and cell survival. "We have made significant advances in the battle against kidney cancer," said Steven Galson, M.D., M.P.H., director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Torisel is the third drug approved for this indication in the past 18 months, and one that shows an increased time in survival for some patients." The approval of Torisel follows the December 2005 approval of Nexavar (sorafenib), which was based on a delay in progression of disease. In January 2006, Sutent (sunitinib) received accelerated approval based on durable response rate, or tumor size reduction, and was later demonstrated to delay tumor progression. The safety and effectiveness of Torisel were shown in a clinical trial of 626 patients divided into three groups. One group received Torisel alone, another received a comparison drug called Interferon alfa, and a third received a combination of Torisel and interferon. The group of patients who received Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival. The median overall survival was 10.9 months for patients on Torisel alone versus 7.3 months for those treated with the interferon alone. Progression-free survival (when the disease does not get worse) increased from 3.1 months on the interferon alone arm to 5.5 months on the Torisel alone arm. The combination of Torisel and interferon did not result in a significant increase in overall survival when compared with interferon alone. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 30 percent of Torisel-treated patients, were rash, fatigue, mouth sores, nausea, edema, and loss of appetite. The most common laboratory abnormalities were high blood sugar, elevated blood lipids and triglycerides, elevated liver and kidney blood tests, and low red cell, white cell, and platelet counts. Renal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in about 51,000 people annually in the United States, accounts for about 85 percent of all U.S. adult kidney cancer.

New guidelines issued by the World Health Organization on 30 May have recommended that doctors everywhere, including richer nations, consider routinely offering the test. The aim is to identify carriers before they unwittingly spread the virus or get too ill to benefit from treatment. In some parts of sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is rife, only 12 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women know their HIV status, while research in the US has shown that unwitting carriers account for 50 to 70 per cent of new infections. "I think this is extremely important," says Kevin De Cock, the WHO's HIV/AIDS director. "This is advice for countries and it must be country-led." The guidelines stress that no one should feel forced to take a test, and people can opt out. But by ... The complete article is 352 words long.

Smoking was banned in bars, restaurants, taverns, casinos, on school grounds and within nine metres of any exterior door of a health, social services or educational institution. Quebec was one of the last bastions of the smoky bar, and there were dire warnings that the province's legendary joie de vivre and nightlife would be crushed under the advances of Big Brother. Despite the sky-is-falling claims of some bar owners (most of them aligned with Big Tobacco), the world as we know it did not come to a grinding, smokeless halt. Bar business did not go &#34;poof.&#34; Bingo halls did not go bankrupt. Nicotine addicts did not drop dead outside hospitals as they trudged nine metres from the door desperately searching for a place for a legal puff. In fact, according to a new poll, the smoking ban is enormously popular with the public: 78 per cent of Quebeckers surveyed - including 60 per cent of current smokers - said the legislation has improved the health and quality of life of citizens. Interestingly, it is young adults aged 18 to 24 - the demographic that tends to hang out in bars and restaurants and the age group in which smoking is most popular - who are the most enthusiastic about the smoke-free rules. &#34;The more people go to bars the more they appreciate the new law,&#34; said Louis Gauvin, spokesman for the Quebec Coalition for Tobacco Control. According to the Quebec poll, about one in 10 smokers have kicked the habit in the year since the ban was introduced. The quit rate was twice as high, 21 per cent, in the youngest age group. Now, you can dismiss the poll as the work of anti-tobacco zealots, but nothing in the survey is the least bit surprising. The majority of provinces and territories - British Columbia and Alberta being the notable exceptions - have comprehensive smoke-free legislation, and municipal bylaws are commonplace. All the credible research has repeatedly shown the same results: smoke-free laws have no discernible impact on sales of food or liquor; smoking bans help people quit; outlawing smoking is popular with the general public; and the stronger and the more extensive the ban, the more bang you get for your buck in terms of public-health benefits. Yet for all the perceived bellyaching by business, and strong public support for smoke-free legislation, laws remain pretty tame in Canada. Quebec, for example, still allows smoking on most patios (why restaurant and bar owners reserve prime seating for smokers, a small minority, defies logic) and the sidewalks outside some bars and office towers are like giant ashtrays, a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the law. Similarly, it remains far too easy to buy cigarettes, even for minors. And our health system provides paltry support to those trying to quit. Fewer than 20 per cent of Canadians now smoke. Yet we still tolerate smoking in virtually all public spaces such as parks and allow parents to smoke in cars in the presence of their children, areas where numerous European jurisdictions have cracked down. It is clear that there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. There are about 4,000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke, more than 50 of them carcinogenic. Exposure to second-hand smoke causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and worsens existing conditions such as asthma. Sound public-health policy requires that all workplaces and public places be 100-per-cent smoke-free. No exceptions. This is not a persecution of smokers: it is necessary for the protection of non-smokers. Many policy makers and public-health officials think of anti-smoking campaigns as pass&#233; and boring. But tobacco remains a leading killer, claiming the lives of 45,000 Canadians a year. It also costs the economy about $24-billion annually in medical costs and productivity losses. Globally, smoking already claims more than five million lives a year, and tobacco companies have shifted their marketing efforts and opposition to anti-smoking legislation to the developing world. Unless dramatic and sustained action is taken, smoking will kill more than one billion people worldwide in the 21st Century - 10 times the number who died in the 20th Century. Smoking is not somebody else's problem. It is a continuing public-health disaster and a drain on prosperity. We should think of that each time we enjoy a meal or a drink in a smoke-free restaurant or bar. And each puff of smoke that assaults us when walking down the sidewalk, or that blows across a patio to sour an outing, should serve as a reminder that much more remains to be done. well as an active duty marine infantryman i have to...

How much inconvenience and fright do these people have to go thru while they wait to see if they've picked up this very serious form of TB? All because one peron couldn't be responsible and change his plans. While it may be unlikely, how will he feel if someone gets sick and dies because of what he did? I think he should be held responsible for his actions. This man needs jail time or fines. May 31st, 2007 - 14:57:44 This kind of blatant disregard for others is a crime. I hope the fellow passengers on his flights that need testing sue him for all he's worth for endangering their lives and the lives of thousands should the infection spread.

But if you've also heard the story of Marge and her Daughters -- which sounds like an animated movie and could be if Disney or Pixar get their hands on it -- you know that that epithet's days are numbered. That's because Marge, a Friesen cow discovered in New Zealand, isn't exactly your normal bovine. Sure, she produces milk just like most cows, but the milk she produces is decidedly different. You see, while about 3.5 per cent of most cows' milk is saturated fat, health conscious Marge's milk contains only about one per cent. This means that Marge can give you skim milk right from the udder. It also means that butter made from Marge's milk is so soft it spreads like margarine. Email to a friend Better yet, her milk is also high in omega-3 oils, which are believed to improve brain power. A New Zealand dairy company discovered Marge after testing millions of cattle. So the company purchased Marge and now has its research scientists working on finding the gene that allows cows to produce low-fat milk. Though they have yet to discover the gene, scientists have found that about half of Marge's daughters also possess it, and hence they too can produce healthier milk. But according to Russell Snell, the chief scientist with the biotech firm ViaLactia, if one of Marge's son's also possessed the gene, it would constitute the "holy grail," since a "low-fat" bull would allow breeders to reproduce hundreds of thousands of cattle like Marge. One might wonder what the big deal is since milk manufacturers already produce low-fat by skimming off its fat. But many consumers find milk loses its taste when fat is skimmed, so Marge represents an opportunity to provide full-tasting milk with only a fraction of the fat. All of which means that Marge and her low-fat progeny could help to rehabilitate the reputation of milk. And they could also give the reputation of cows a much-needed shot in the leg.

He apparently also shortened his honeymoon &#8212; which included stays in Greece and Italy &#8212; and returned home early to avoid the complicated procedure being put together to get him back to the United States in a way that would not expose others to his dangerous microbe. The man, back in Georgia and undergoing treatment, provided a different version of events to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, saying he was never explicitly told he could not travel. The man and his fianc&#233;e traveled from Paris to Athens, where the two married, and to two Greek islands. "We headed off to Greece thinking everything's fine," the man told the Atlanta paper. He declined interview requests Wednesday. Because of privacy issues, he has not been identified; he is said to be in his 30s. Wednesday, officials from the Fulton County Health and Wellness Department and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they emphatically told him to stay put. "He was told in no uncertain terms that he had a serious, contagious disease," said Dr. Steven Katkowsky, director of the Fulton County health department. "We told him not to travel." Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC's division of global migration and quarantine, said the agency is making slow progress in reaching passengers and crew aboard the man's trans-Atlantic flights. Authorities in the United States and several European countries are tracking down about 50 people who sat near the man on his Atlanta-to-Paris flight May 12, and 30 people on his Prague-to-Montreal return last Thursday. They will be offered testing to see if they are infected. CDC officials are concentrating on the trans-Atlantic flights, when the likelihood of disease spread was greatest because the man was in a confined space with others for hours. Authorities also disclosed that the man was on several flights between various European locales during the time he was abroad. Passenger lists for those flights also were being tracked down, officials said. Cetron stressed that the chances that other people were infected is low. But because the man's disease, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR-TB, is so difficult to treat, the agency could take no chances. The CDC is isolating the man under a federal public-health order, the first issued since the isolation of a smallpox patient in 1963. It remained unclear how the man contracted TB, and his wife tested negative for the illness, the CDC said. The man's illness was discovered after he fell, hurt his ribs and got an X-ray, which revealed an abnormality in his right lung, suggesting TB. In March, lab tests revealed he had TB. By May 10, further tests showed it was "multidrug-resistant" version: It could not be killed by the two most commonly used drugs. That same day, Eric Benning, of the Fulton County health department, met with the patient and his personal physician. Benning said he told the man "it was our recommendation that he not travel because of the potential exposure of other people but also for his benefit." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted the man as saying local health officials told him they "preferred" he not travel. When more tests revealed the man had the extensively drug-resistant TB, the CDC reached the man in Rome by cellphone, told him not to travel and said arrangements for travel and treatment were being made, Cetron said. The man told the Atlanta paper he interpreted that conversation as meaning he was stuck in Italy and decided to sneak home because he feared he would die without treatment in the United States. "I thought to myself: 'You're nuts.' I wasn't going to do that," he said. Although his plans were to return June 5, he and his wife returned to the United States on Thursday. CDC officials reached the man on his cellphone Friday near Albany, N.Y. He drove himself to a hospital in New York and was taken in a CDC plane back to Atlanta on Monday. He is isolated at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta and is in stable condition, the CDC said. Cetron said the man wants to be taken to the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, one of the few U.S. institutions where TB has been a research focus for decades.

A study found that women who snacked on the superfood up to four times a day saw their levels of “bad” cholesterol drop, and they also had healthier blood pressure readings. Soy nuts, which are similar to peanuts, are made from whole soya beans soaked in water and baked. Researchers in Boston, USA, recruited 60 post­menopausal women with blood pressures ranging from healthy to high. Half were asked to follow a diet getting 30 per cent of calories from fat, 15 per cent from protein and 55 per cent from carbohydrates. It also included two portions per week of oily fish and 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. The other women were told to adopt the same diet but replace 25 grammes of the protein with half a cup of soy nuts a day. After eight weeks, those with high blood pressure who ate nuts saw their top systolic blood pressure drop by almost 10 per cent. Low diastolic readings dropped by an average 6.8 per cent. Soy contains isoflavones, also thought to ward off osteoporosis and protect against breast and colon cancer. &#9679;Pregnant women are warned to take iron supplements only if they are anaemic because they can raise blood pressure and result in smaller babies.

Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin NATIONAL (NBC) - Most of us know the best way to protect yourself against skin cancer is to cover up and wear sunscreen. But you may be able to drink your way to safer skin. To protect yourself from sun damage and skin cancer, dermatologist Doctor Bryan Chen says there&#39;s steps you should take. "The use of sunscreens to cover up the best that you can from the sun, the use of hats during the day, and try to avoid the sun during the hours of 10 in the morning to two in the afternoon when the sun intensity is the greatest outdoors - that in combination with drinking tea - I think would be useful." Drinking just one cup of tea a day will lower your risk of getting the two most common types of skin cancer - squamous and basal cell carcinoma. That&#39;s according to a report from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. Dr. Chen says, "Teas have long been known to contain antioxidants in them - and also chemicals called polyphenals." In the first human study of more than 2,000 people - tea&#39;s antioxidants were found to limit the effects of the sun&#39;s ultraviolet rays. But, Doctor Chen says, tea isn&#39;t the cure-all for skin cancer. "Just because you drink tea doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a 100% protection against the development of skin cancer. You really do need to do it in combination with other protective measures protect yourself from the sun." Scientists found the more tea you drink each day and over the years, the better the skin protection. It doesn&#39;t matter if the tea is hot or cold. And all types of tea offered protection, including green, black and herbal tea. All content &copy; Copyright 2000 - 2007 WorldNow and WISTV, a All Rights Reserved.

EU sports White Paper to address 'inclusion' Support for free fruit and vegetable distribution Obese children influenced by TV adverts, study... 'Doctors need better training to help obese... Consumer needs drive innovation in food sector According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the prevalence of obesity has more than trebled in many European countries since the 1980s. People consume more calories per day, in particular from fat, whereas their physical activity levels have gone down.  Child obesity is of particular concern as obese young tend to become obese adults, with all the health risks this condition represents: heart disease, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and certain types of cancer. According to the Commission, some three million European schoolchildren are obese and some 85,000 more children become obese each year.  Obesity related illnesses are estimated to account for as much as 7% of total healthcare costs in the EU.  EU platform for action on diet, physical activity and health brings, since March 2005, together industry, consumer groups and health experts to find ways to combat obesity. Its emphasis is on self-regulation and voluntary commitments from the stakeholders. on 'Promoting healthy diets and physical activity: a European dimension for the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases' was adopted in December 2005. "Our biggest achievement so far is that we have managed to raise knowledge on obesity and to get everybody to recognise that there is a problem," said Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou presenting the  on 'A Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity related health issues', adopted by the Commission on 30 May 2007.  "What consumers eat is up to them, but they should be able to make informed choices, and have a range of healthy options to choose from. That is why the Commission is reviewing the options for nutrition labelling, and calling on industry to advertise responsibly and reduce levels of salt, fats and sugar in food products," he added.  However, "given the urgency of the matter, it is better to try with self-regulation at first and see, in 2010, if there's a need for legislation," said Kyprianou arguing that "offering industry these two and half years", after which member states could decide to legislate, represented a "great incentive for industry to co-operate on the obesity problem". Building on the EU obesity platform and the Green Paper on promoting healthy diets and physical activity, the White Paper calls for more cross-sectoral action-orientated partnerships across the EU. These would involve private actors and public health and consumer organisations.  The Commission is also urging the private sector to develop stronger advertising codes, the food and retailing industry to make greater efforts to reformulate foods and sport organisations to develop advertising and marketing campaigns to encourage physical activity focusing in particular on children. With regard the obesity platform launched in March 2005, Kyprianou said that it "is starting to produce results even though we have not reached target yet." Therefore, this platform will continue discussions. A High-Level Group on nutrition, overweight and obesity related health issues will be established to liaise the platform at member state level to ensure exchange of best practices.  As to physical activity, Commissioner Kyprianou recognised that the issue is more in the hands of member states and that the challenge is not the same in all EU-27. "Children do not entertain themselves through physical activity anymore. Therefore, schools should re-introduce physical activity as entertainment to their curricula instead of pure physical performance exercise," he said. The Confederation of the food and drink industries of the EU ( ) and the Association of the chocolate, biscuit and confectionery industries ( ) have welcomed the Commission's strategy.  The association of television and radio sales houses ( ) also welcomed the strategy and the fact that "the Commission recognises the added value of and supports advertising self-regulation".  the individual is ultimately responsible for his lifestyle and that advertising and marketing are only  that shape an environment in which consumers take individual decisions, the European Commission is moving away from simplistic and ineffective additional restrictions to advertising of food products," states egta.  , "the commerce sector is pleased to see that the White Paper acknowledges the effectiveness of multi-stakeholder approaches to fight against obesity. Voluntary initiatives are recognised as important tools to promote healthy lifestyles. EuroCommerce welcomes the fact that the Commission will give these time to produce result before proposing any new legislation." "EuroCommerce members are confident that voluntary initiatives are more effective and tailor-made to help the consumer understand the benefit of both good diet and healthy lifestyle."  The European Consumers' Organisation ( ) qualifies the strategy as "a disappointing, unambitious and minimalist response to the problems of obesity and diet related diseases that the White Paper itself identifies. On advertising of food for children the White Paper talks vaguely about partnerships and voluntary measures, with a review in 2010 – when there will be a new Commission."  "Reading the White Paper it seems that Mr Kyprianou and the Barroso Commission have already decided to leave much of the work to their successors – who will no doubt themselves wish to 'review the situation' before deciding what to do," deplored BEUC Director Jim Murray urging the current Commission to do "much more before they go" and to at least to bring forward a "robust proposal for simplified nutritional labelling". Latest & next steps: The Commission will monitor the progress and performance of all actors in the next three years and conduct a first review in 2010. The EU-27 health ministers held a public debate on health promotion by means of nutrition and physical activity and adopted Council conclusions on the issue on 31 May 2007. Commissioner Kypirianou is set to establish the High-Level Group on nutrition, overweight and obesity related health issues "right after the summer break" in autumn 2007.

Complete Moisture Plus was pulled from sale in the US six days ago following a warning from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. US government officials linked the solution to acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), a painful eye infection. Advanced Medical Optics (AMO) which makes the solution, has issued the recall as a "precautionary measure". AMO said in a statement: "The recall is being initiated because of concerns over eye infections from acanthamoeba, a naturally occurring water-borne organism which can contribute to serious corneal infections." The recall is not related to contamination and no other AMO products are affected, the firm added. The company is asking contact lens wearers who begin suffering eye pain, redness, blurred vision or sensitivity to light to seek medical attention. There are reports of 138 cases of eye infections in the US which are being investigated. But AMO said it had not received any reports of UK users suffering eye problems. Those who swim or shower while wearing contact lenses, use tap water to clean their lenses or come into contact with contaminated water are most are most prone to getting AK, the company said. The eye infection can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness in rare cases.

The 32-year-old American, who is under the first U.S. government-ordered quarantine since 1963, flew from Atlanta to Paris in early May to celebrate his wedding and honeymoon in Europe and returned from Prague by way of Montreal, each time taking regular trans-Atlantic flights. The decision was taken at the recommendation of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and concerns people who were in close proximity to the American, who has a highly drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB), on board the flights. "As a precautionary measure and following recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO), the ECDC's advice is to perform contact tracing for passengers 2 rows ahead, 2 rows behind and the row of the infected passenger, and the cabin crew concerned," the ECDC said in a statement. "The ECDC's advice is that the risk for these persons is very limited, other passengers are not considered at risk."

According to Science Daily , scientists in Auckland, New Zealand, have bred a skim-milk producing cow successfully. In addition to producing milk that is skim, the milk from this cow also has other benefits. Plans are in the making for creating herds of this type of cow, now that research shows it can be done. ViaLactia, the biotech firm responsible for breeding the cow, says it will target health-conscious consumers with their marketing campaigns. In addition to the milk being naturally skim (low in fat content), the milk also has other benefits. It has a normal level of protein, differing from skim milk that is manufactured. Russel Snell, the chief scientist at ViaLactia told UPI ( quoted on Science Daily ) about the original cow "She produces a normal level of protein in her milk but substantially less fat, and the fat she does produce has much more unsaturated fat. She also produces milk with very high levels of omega3 oils." Protein is essential for hair and nails. They are made up of mostly protein. All cells require protein. It is used to build tissue and also to repair it. Protein is used in making enzymes, hormones, and other essential body chemicals. This milk could also be great for heart health because according to the , "Replacing some carbohydrates with protein and unsaturated fat may enhance heart health benefits". The Omega3 Oils, usually found in fish and soy products, are also heart healthy. These oils are highly recommended by the The original cow was found by ViaLactia in 2001, but it was recently evidenced that she passed the skim-milk producing trait on to her calves. With this success, it is a marketable product as the calves can then also be bred to create a herd, which in turn could create more and more of these skim-milk producing cows in accordance with product demand. Snell says "You have to generate daughters and then they have to carry a calf and deliver milk. The eureka moment was when we found her daughters produced milk like their mother."

Urges HIV Testing for All Patients in Hard-Hit Nations Washington Post Foreign Service Thursday, May 31, 2007; Page A15 JOHANNESBURG, May 30 -- health officials on Wednesday called on nations with severe AIDS epidemics to offer routine, confidential HIV tests to all patients at health-care facilities in hopes of dramatically expanding the number of those who know they have the virus. Patients would retain the right to refuse the test, but the new guidelines mark a significant departure from the common practice of relying on patients to seek tests for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. U.N. officials estimate that nearly 80 percent of the people with HIV in poor and developing countries do not know they have it. In alone, they said, nearly 20 million people with HIV are not aware they have the virus.

Save & Share Article The new guidelines will not immediately alleviate the problem. Individual nations must first decide whether to adopt them and allocate money to expand testing. That is likely to prove difficult in , where a severe shortage of doctors and nurses already is straining health systems, medical experts said. The new guidelines also call for mandatory counseling to accompany the HIV testing. No new U.N. funding has been set aside for the initiative. "I see difficulty in following those guidelines in our circumstances," said Derek von Wissell, head of 's national AIDS council, speaking from the capital, Mbabane. "It's going to take an hour per patient. And I don't think we have that kind of resource available to us." The guidelines also call for physicians anywhere in the world to offer testing to patients who exhibit symptoms of AIDS. But in the several dozen nations where infection rates exceed 1 percent, everyone seeking medical care should be offered an HIV test, regardless of their symptoms or the reason for seeking care, the U.N. officials said. already have similar policies. The officials said they were seeking to formulate guidelines that would expand testing while respecting individual rights. Other approaches to testing, including at stand-alone facilities, also would be encouraged. "People need to know their HIV status, and there are many different ways to achieve that," Kevin De Cock, director of the HIV/AIDS department for the , said in a conference call with journalists. The heavy stigma that long has accompanied AIDS has made testing a sensitive issue, especially in Africa, where there have been well-publicized cases of violence against people who have tested positive. But the lack of adequate testing has hampered efforts to provide the sophisticated antiretroviral treatment that increasingly is available even in the poorest nations. Many people discover they have HIV only when they become gravely ill, making it more difficult, and far more costly, to effectively treat them. Zackie Achmat of the Treatment Action Campaign, an activist group in , told reporters on the conference call that the new guidelines respected the rights of those with HIV while also improving their chances of accessing medical services. "These guidelines are long, long overdue," Achmat said. The U.N. officials said expanded testing may also improve efforts to prevent new infections, but the research on that is unclear. There is scant evidence that people who test negative for HIV change their sexual behavior. And there is no proven correlation between high rates of HIV testing in nations and falling rates of new infections. also questioned whether the move toward more extensive testing would lead to the trampling of individual rights. The new U.N. guidelines say that spoken consent, rather than written, is sufficient for HIV testing. "The concern I have is that not enough is being done to monitor HIV testing programs to make sure that consent is granted and testing is confidential and counseling is offered," Joseph Amon, head of the group's AIDS program, said from New York.

Sinai: 'Third Wave' Of 9/11 Illnesses Appear Slideshow: The World Trade Center Remembered WCBSTV.com's 9/11 Special Report There are new cancer concerns at Ground Zero. Doctors fear a third wave of illness is starting to show up among first responders who worked in the rubble of the Twin Towers. For many years, scientists reported that it was too soon to link cancers to the toxins that workers were exposed to at Ground Zero after 9/11. But new research could start linking exposure to blood cancers. More than 20,000 responders to the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks have been examined by doctors at Mount Sinai's World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program, and those doctors are now worried about some of those responders could soon be facing a devastating "third wave" of illnesses. The concern is that those who worked at Ground Zero will be diagnosed with blood and lymphatic cancers because of their exposure to the air at "The Pit." The first wave of illnesses was considered to be that stubborn, dry "World Trade Center cough," which was first noticed in the months following the attacks. The cough was likely caused by workers inhaling pulverized cement in the air while working downtown. The second wave largely involves chronic respiratory diseases that cause lung inflammation and scarring. The third wave is now expected to include cancers among responders who were exposed to asbestos, dioxins and other carcinogens at Ground Zero. This new information was released in Thursday's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, where Dr. Robin Herbert, the co-director of Mount Sinai's World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program, described the latest findings in an online audio interview. "We know we have a handful of cases of multiple myeloma in very young individuals. And multiple myelomas usually present later in life. And that's the odd, unusual and troubling finding we're seeing already," Herbert said. Ironically, the latest findings could be welcome news for some Ground Zero workers. These newly released findings could help the case for a lawyer representing more than 100 workers, who claim they got cancer by working at Ground Zero.

Zimbabwe will put 40,000 more people on life saving anti-retroviral drugs by the end of the year despite an economic crisis that has hobbled the country's health care, state media reported on Tuesday. REUTERS/Howard Burditt HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will put 40,000 more people on life saving anti-retroviral drugs by the end of the year despite an economic crisis that has hobbled the country's health care, state media reported on Tuesday. The southern African country is among the worst hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, killing more than 3,000 people every week and accounting for 70 percent of hospital admissions. But Zimbabwe, in the grips of a deep recession, has also become one of the few AIDS bright spots on the continent after its HIV prevalence rate declined to 18.1 percent last year from 25 percent six years ago. Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said the number of people receiving the life-prolonging medicines has increased from 60,000 in December to 80,000 this month but that the government would add another 40,000 patients by the end of the year. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) "Currently the number of people on ARVs has grown to 80,000 since December last year and we hope to achieve our target of getting 120,000 by the end of the year," Parirenyatwa told the official Herald newspaper. Parirenyatwa said that at least 300,000 people living with HIV/AIDS were in urgent need of ARVs. Zimbabwe's drive to increase access to ARVs has been hampered by a severe shortage of foreign currency, itself a sign of an economic crisis that has pushed inflation past 3,700 percent and increased poverty levels. The crisis has been particularly felt in the health sector, where basic drugs are in short supply while strikes for better pay by doctors and nurses have worsened the situation. President Robert Mugabe -- who says Zimbabwe is showing the way for Africa in the fight against HIV/AIDS -- rejects charges of mismanagement and blames the West for sabotaging the economy as punishment for seizing white-owned farms to distribute to blacks.

"What we're trying to handle right now ... is what the CDC hit us with," said James Mazzo, president and chief executive officer of Santa Ana, Calif.-based Advanced Medical Optics Inc., in a Tuesday morning conference call. Government officials Friday warned people to throw away AMO Complete Moisture Plus Multi-Purpose Solution, using for cleaning and storing soft contact lenses, after an investigation linked it to a rare eye infection. The solution seems to be a factor in cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis, a painful eye infection caused by a waterborne organism that, untreated, can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. "It's not a manufacturing problem or a contamination issue," said Mazzo, who added that the infection, also called "AK," affects people who improperly handle contact lenses, such as disinfecting them with water or wearing them while swimming or showering. "AK is something the vast majority of contact lens users typically avoid by following their eye practitioner's advice," Mazzo said. "All of our products ... have always met and continue to meet FDA requirements. Moisture Plus does what it is required to do." CDC officials said they drew a link between the Advanced Medical Optics product and the infection because 58 percent of confirmed cases who wore soft contact lenses had used the solution in the month before onset of symptoms, and 39 percent had used only that solution. They calculated that wearers of soft contact lenses who had the infection were at least seven times more likely to have used AMO Complete Moisture Plus than healthy people who wear soft contact lenses. It's generally difficult to draw a strong statistical conclusion from a small number of cases, but in this case an association between the product and the infection was clear-cut, CDC officials said. Health officials will continue to investigate why the association exists. But in the interest of public health, they decided a warning was necessary, said Dr. Sharon Roy, the CDC epidemiologist who led the investigation. Chief Financial Officer Randy Meier said that the Moisture Plus products' $105.7 million in 2006 sales represent about 10 percent of the company's total consolidated sales. "We're still working through the details to determine how much of that revenue will be impacted by the recall," Meier said. "It is impossible to assess what path we'll take or what the impact will be to our future earnings." Meier said the company will update investors early next week. "While this recall is clearly a setback for our eye care business, none of our other products will be affected," Meier said. Shares of Advanced Medical Optics fell 13.7 percent to $34.69 Tuesday. The CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are investigating 138 confirmed cases since January 2005. CDC officials said people should discard the solution, throw out their current contact lenses and toss away the lens storage case. All of them may harbor the infecting amoeba, said Michael Beach, team leader in the CDC's division of parasitic diseases. An estimated 85 percent of U.S. cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis occur in contact lens users, but it's extremely rare. The estimated prevalence is one to two cases per 1 million contact lens wearers. Contact lens wearers who practice proper lens care and people who don't wear contact lenses can still develop the infection.

U.S. health officials Tuesday urged hundreds of travelers aboard two Air France and Czech Air flights be tested for a drug-resistant tuberculosis carried by a passenger now quarantined in Atlanta. (File Photo) BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhuanet) -- The U.S. health authorities begin a worldwide search for passengers on two trans-Atlantic flights who may have come into contact with a man infected with a potentially deadly form of tuberculosis, media reported Wednesday. The U.S. government Centers for Disease Control (DCD) in Atlanta, Georgia, are seeking around 80 passengers and a further 27 crew members in two flights taken by the infected man, said Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's division of global migration and quarantine. Two flights involved Air France AF385 from Atlanta to Paris on May 12 and Czech Air 0104 from Prague to Montreal on May 24. Other passengers on the flights are not considered at high risk of infection because tests indicated the amount of TB bacteria in them was "quite low," Cetron said. The man, who is under the first U.S. government-ordered quarantine since 1963, was infected with a rare case of extreme drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR TB. He told a newspaper he flew from Atlanta to Greece for a wedding and then traveled to Italy for a honeymoon. Later he flew back to North America for treatment. He also took several other flights in Greece and Italy, but the health agency stressed that those on these shorter flights did not face a significant risk. The man is being held in isolation and under armed guard at a U.S. hospital in the southern state of Georgia. Health officials said the man had been advised not to fly and knew he could expose others when he boarded the jets. But the man said doctors did not order him not to fly.

Back problems are a difficult challenge for doctors in part because it is difficult to know when to operate. Consider sciatica, where a leg becomes numb or pain shoots down a leg because a nerve is pinched. In 75 percent of patients, the problem improves without surgery within three months. Nonetheless, 1.5 million disk operations are done worldwide each year. Typically, doctors remove part of the disk to take the pressure off the nerve. One new study, led by Wilco Peul of the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, looked at 283 patients who had suffered with the problem for at least six weeks. They found that 95 percent reported recovery after one year, whether or not they had surgery. However, 39 percent assigned to conservative care opted for surgery anyway, typically after about five months, and surgery relieved the symptoms twice as quickly. "Thus, for patients with persistent sciatica, there seems to be a reasonable choice between surgical and nonsurgical treatment, which may be influenced by aversion to surgical risks, the severity of symptoms, and willingness to wait for spontaneous healing," Richard Deyo of the University of Washington in Seattle said in a Journal editorial. The second study looked at a very different problem where degeneration in the spine bones causes one to slip too far forward. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

In making the recommendations, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS are underlining the need to identify the millions worldwide who need treatment. WHO estimates that approximately 80 percent of HIV-positive people in developing countries are currently unaware of their status. "If we are serious about ensuring universal access to drugs, there has to be a fundamental change in the approach to HIV testing," said Dr. Kevin De Cock, director of WHO's AIDS department. The UN now advises health workers to test patients for HIV as part of standard medical care, but only with the patient's informed consent. Yet there are questions about how the cash-strapped countries in Africa might adopt these guidelines. Of the estimated 40 million people living worldwide with HIV/AIDS, nearly 65 percent are in Africa. Because current estimates of the number of HIV/AIDS patients include people who don't know their status, experts do not expect the numbers to rise dramatically if more people are tested. Though universal testing will certainly identify more HIV-positive people needing lifesaving anti-retrovirals, there is already a long waiting list: Nearly 5 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are still without treatment. Identifying more AIDS patients whom countries cannot afford to treat threatens to create an even bigger backlog of people who know they are sick, but have no access to care. Most AIDS experts believe that increased HIV testing will help, even if the conditions are not perfect. "No one wants a situation where people find out they're HIV-positive and can't get anti-retroviral treatment," said Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of HIV policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation. "But if we waited until everything was perfectly aligned, we would never respond." Another benefit of testing: Past studies also have shown that once people are aware that they are HIV-positive, they tend to practice safer sex - which could give prevention efforts a boost. Africa's weak health infrastructure, though, is a huge stumbling block. The continent urgently needs at least another 4 million health workers to fill the gap, according to WHO. Without doctors and nurses to administer the HIV tests or to provide the necessary treatment when patients are identified, such guidance will create even more stress for Africa's already fragile health systems. Still, the new testing procedures should mean that HIV patients are found earlier. "The biggest problem we have now is that our health care systems are overburdened with very sick people who come in too late," said Zackie Achmat, chairman of South Africa's Treatment Action Campaign. "These new guidelines are long overdue," said Achmat. "We cannot deal with the burden on the health care service if we don't prevent people from becoming so sick that they become a supreme burden on it," he said. Increased HIV testing and the treatment and infrastructure it ultimately entails will require more money, yet no new funds have been announced to help countries implement these policies. The UN estimates that the fight against AIDS in 2007-2008 requires $22 billion, and there is still a considerable shortfall. Last year, the deficit for global AIDS programs was about $6 billion. While health authorities would like to see the new UN recommendations adopted as soon as possible, much will depend on whether countries decide to follow their advice. "I hope that countries start implementing this immediately," said WHO's De Cock. "But we know you can't just flip the switch and change everything in one day."

It is widely accepted that AIDS results from infection with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). Boehringer Ingelheim initiates international head-to-head HIV/AIDS trial Buy best HIV products from Amazon HIV :: Boehringer Ingelheim initiates international head-to-head HIV/AIDS trial Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH announced that it has initiated and begun enrollment of patients in the ArTEN trial, which will compare the efficacy and safety of Viramune® (nevirapine), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), dosed once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID), versus atazanavir/ritonavir, a once-daily dosed protease inhibitor (PI). Both agents will be combined with a background regimen including tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada®). The ArTEN trial will enroll 561 HIV-positive patients who have not been treated with antiretrovirals before. “ArTEN is an important trial. Viramune® dosed twice daily is proven to be an effective, tolerable and durable treatment option with a favourable lipid profile. In ArTEN, Viramune® will be compared with an atazanavir-based regimen. ArTEN may help to provide more information on selecting treatment options for first-line therapy in HIV-positive patients,” said Vicente Soriano, M.D., assistant professor, University Complutense and chief, infectious diseases, Hospital Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. The ArTEN (Atazanavir/ritonavir on a background of Tenofovir and Emtricitabine (Truvada®) versus Nevirapine) trial is a Phase IIIb, open-label, multinational, randomised, three-arm trial. The primary endpoint is virologic response after 48 weeks of treatment. Treatment response is defined as a viral load of less than 50 copies/mL measured at two consecutive visits prior to week 48 and without subsequent rebound or change of antiretroviral therapy prior to week 48. Patients will be randomised to receive 200 mg of Viramune® BID, 400 mg of Viramune® QD or 300 mg of atazanavir, boosted with 100 mg of ritonavir, with a backbone regimen of tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada®). Patients in the Viramune® arm will begin their treatment with 200 mg QD, increased to either 200 mg BID or 400 mg QD after two weeks. Patients will be observed for a period of 48 weeks, with an extension period of up to 144 weeks. “Viramune® has proven to be a good treatment choice for HIV-positive patients during more than one million patient years of experience and extensive clinical trials,” said Dr. Andreas Barner, Vice-Chairman, Board of Managing Directors and Head of Corporate Board Division Pharma Research, Development and Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim. “The new ArTEN trial aims to help patients and physicians better understand the role of Viramune® within today’s evolving treatment strategies. We expect ArTEN trial results will be available in 2009.” (Last updated on Thursday, May 31, 2007, and first posted on Monday, May 14, 2007) Send to a Friend Recently posted related articles on HIV : HIV :: New HIV recommendations aim for wider knowledge of HIV status HIV :: WHO, UNAIDS' new guidance on HIV testing & counselling in health facilities HIV :: New study suggests potential for a broadly-protective HIV vaccine HIV :: New AIDS Tech Transfers reinforce Roche commitment to strengthen African manufacturing HIV :: Health workers & doctors shortage limits AIDS care in South Africa HIV :: AHF counters GSK ads that promote fear of HIV treatment Hepatitis C :: Hepatitis C negatively impacts HIV HIV :: Indian Court dismisses petition seeking compulsory HIV test for couples HIV :: Alarming rise in HIV/AIDS cases in Bihar HIV :: Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is proving effective Encyclopedia details on HIV best books on HIV .

The southern African country is among the worst hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, killing more than 3,000 people every week and accounting for 70 percent of hospital admissions. But Zimbabwe, in the grips of a deep recession, has also become one of the few AIDS bright spots on the continent after its HIV prevalence rate declined to 18.1 percent last year from 25 percent six years ago. Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said the number of people receiving the life-prolonging medicines has increased from 60,000 in December to 80,000 this month but that the government would add another 40,000 patients by the end of the year. "Currently the number of people on ARVs has grown to 80,000 since December last year and we hope to achieve our target of getting 120,000 by the end of the year," Parirenyatwa told the official Herald newspaper. Parirenyatwa said that at least 300,000 people living with HIV/AIDS were in urgent need of ARVs. Zimbabwe's drive to increase access to ARVs has been hampered by a severe shortage of foreign currency, itself a sign of an economic crisis that has pushed inflation past 3,700 percent and increased poverty levels. The crisis has been particularly felt in the health sector, where basic drugs are in short supply while strikes for better pay by doctors and nurses have worsened the situation. President Robert Mugabe -- who says Zimbabwe is showing the way for Africa in the fight against HIV/AIDS -- rejects charges of mismanagement and blames the West for sabotaging the economy as punishment for seizing white-owned farms to distribute to blacks. news is provided by Zoom to full size map ZIMBABWE: Pro-government militias launch intimidation campaign against Catholics EU to give AIDS/TB/malaria fund 400 million euros Blair urges G8 to keep African promises Zimbabwe dehorns rhino to deter poachers - paper FACTBOX-Facts on African dictators' legal cases Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision Lauds Bush Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA HIV and AIDS: Turning Remembrance Into Action on Candlelight Memorial Day Source: WV MEERO - Cyprus Put food at the heart of the fight against HIV and Aids or fail, warn leading aid agencies Source: CARE International - UK HELP WANTED: Health worker shortage limits access to HIV/AIDS treatment in southern Africa Members of a Libyan court, including judge Salem Hamrouni (C), speak after announcing a verdict in the defamation trial of five Bulgarian nurses in Tripli May 27, 2007.

The infant died of bacteremia, also known as blood poisoning, after contracting the pathogen serratia. Hospital officials did not release the gender of the baby, citing patient confidentiality, but said the baby was premature, and weighed between oneÂ and three pounds. Four other babies have tested positive for serratia, a naturally occurring bacteria that can cause severe infection in vulnerable premature babies. "We don't even know if they have the same strands yet. It's just that because this bacteria can cause such serious infections â€¦ we're being careful," said Dr. Alison McGeer, a microbiologist with the hospital. "With this bacteria you don't take chances." She said, however, thatÂ it's unlikely the unit would have closed if the hospital wasn'tÂ struggling with overcrowding. "The reason it's closed is mostly because we're caring for more babies than we should be anyway," said McGeer, adding that they would have instead isolated the babies. Experts recommend 10 feet (3.05 metres) between incubators, but the decades-old Toronto hospital was built with only four to five feet (1.22 to 1.52 metres). Babies have been isolated and hospital have ramped up infection-control procedures, such as wearing gloves and gowns. Parents and visitorsÂ were still being allowed into the unit Thursday, but no new patients were being accepted.

A Friesian (or Holstein-Friesian) cow is a breed of Holstein diary cow, only smaller and heavier. The website of ViaLactia is: In addition, Marge produces milk that is lower in saturated fat, so that butter produced isn&rsquo;t hard but spreadable. Such milk should also be high in the good fats of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturates. It is also high in omega-3 oils, which is touted as being good for the heart and brain. In five years of breeding, Marge has produced female calves that also make low-fat milk. The scientists are now trying to produce a sire (male calf) that contains the low-fat milk producing gene. Scientists with the 109-million-dollar (U.S.) research project are hoping to produce a commercial herd of low-fat milk producing cows by the year 2011. Currently, the New Zealand milk company called Fonterra already is using Marge&rsquo;s and her offspring&#39;s milk for its customers.

Currently 80% of people infected with HIV in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa do not know they have it. However, no test should be done against a person's wishes or without their knowledge, the guidelines stress. Forcing them to carry out HIV tests insults their intelligence in such a way that they are no different from animals Omara Daniel Allan, Kampala Send us your comments Dr Kevin De Cock, director of WHO HIV/Aids said too many opportunities to diagnose the infection were being missed. Industrialised countries also need to take note of the guidance which recommends offering a test to everyone who presents with symptoms suggestive of HIV and people in high-risk groups, such as those attending sexual health clinics. Recent surveys in sub-Saharan Africa showed on average just 12% of men and 10% of women have been tested for HIV and received their test results. Until now, testing was only done if a person requested it. But in countries with HIV epidemic that affects the whole population, all patients attending all health facilities should now be offered testing, whether or not the patient has symptoms of HIV disease and regardless of the patient's reason for attending the health centre. The HIV test would be carried out unless the patient declines. Tests in low income countries cost up to $2 US dollars. People must be fully informed before testing and receive counselling afterwards, the guidance states. And patients should receive support to avoid potential negative consequences of knowing and disclosing their HIV status, such as discrimination or violence. Access to antiretroviral therapy is not a pre-requisite to testing but countries must have a treatment plan in place, which includes an intention to introduce the drugs when possible. "Globally the number of people living with HIV who are aware of their infection status is quite low - 20% in low and middle income countries" said Dr De Cock. "Even in the industrialised world the situation is far from satisfactory." "This is a significant shift but it builds on current recommendations and this document was based on lengthy consultation." Dr Paul De Lay, director of monitoring and evaluation at UNAids said it had been estimated that 200 million people worldwide could be offered tests which meant they had access to prevention advice and treatment if the were infected. "If we are going to get ahead of this epidemic, rapidly scaled up HIV treatment and prevention efforts are critical - and increased uptake of HIV testing will be fundamental to making this a reality," he said. "At the same time, and in all cases of HIV testing and counselling, the three Cs - that is consent, confidentiality and counselling - must be respected." Routinely offered HIV testing and counselling has already been implemented in a range of clinical settings in several countries, including Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and Zambia. Some countries, such as Canada, Thailand, UK and the US offer tests in high-risk settings. Lisa Power, of the UK HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "We fully support these recommendations. "In the UK, this means that sexual health clinics and health services for those at particular risk of HIV should be recommending HIV testing - something which we've been advocating for some time. "A third of people with HIV don't know they have it and many of them may never have considered testing. We need this proactive approach to help these people as early as possible." Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, said: "Healthcare workers, particularly in primary care, also need training so that they can identify symptoms of HIV as early as possible."

Sedentary mice fed epicatechin -- a natural flavanol found in blueberries, tea, grapes, and cocoa (read: dark chocolate) -- greater memory skills than those who were deprived; exercise boosted performance in both groups. Epicatechin was shown to increase blood-vessel growth in the dentate gyrus -- an area of the brain that undergoes neurogenesis -- and mature neuron development. The addition of exercise further showed increased expression of genes important for learning and memory, and a decrease in genes associated with inflammation and neural degeneration. Unfortunately, there's a potential conflict of interest. This research -- published in the and performed by Henriette van Praag from the Salk Institute -- was supported by DARPA, with the epicatechin provided by . Mars markets "epicatechin-rich" lines of chocolate, including dark chocolate versions of Dove and M&Ms. Will it stop me from enjoying dark chocolate? Not a chance. A 2004 study out of the University of California, San Francisco -- also funded by Mars, Inc. -- found that eating a 1.6-ounce Dove Dark Chocolate bar a day blood flow and blood vessel dilation in humans. Study author Mary Engler said "dark chocolate contains more flavonoids than any other food -- including green tea, black tea, red wine, and blueberries." Natural Compound and Exercise Boost Memory in Mice While epicatechin-fed mice showed an increase in blood-vessels in the dentate gyrus, mice on diets without epicatechin showed greater new cell survival. To compensate, epicatechin upregulated genes associated with neuronal extension, synaptic plasticity, and increased neuronal spine density (which is associated with improved learning and memory). Epicatechin appears to help you make the most of what you have while inhibiting cell growth that may clutter your brain and limit the efficiency of learning.

That's according to a study published in The Journal of Neuroscience The researchers included Fred Gage, PhD, of the genetics lab at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif. In a series of lab tests, Gage's team studied epicatechin, which is a type of antioxidant called a flavonol, in female mice. Some of the mice drank or ate water or chow laced with epicatechin and ran on a running wheel for two hours daily. Other mice ran on a running wheel but didn't get epicatechin. Another group of mice had no running wheel and got no epicatechin in their food or water. After six weeks, the researchers tried to train the mice to navigate a watery maze. The mice were supposed to find a hidden platform in the maze within 40 seconds. The mice that consumed epicatechin did better at memorizing the maze than the mice that got no epicatechin. The mice that consumed epicatechin and also ran on their running wheels had the best results of all. The findings suggest that epicatechin may help spatial memory, especially when coupled with exercise, note Gage and colleagues. Exactly how epicatechin does that isn't clear. But the researchers found signs of blood vessel growth in the brains of the mice that consumed epicatechin. Better blood flow to memory-related brain areas may have helped the mice remember the maze. One of the researchers works for Mars Inc., which makes cocoa products and supplied the study's epicatechin. The study was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Products Agency.

Dr. Parirenyatwa, speaking at a Harare workshop on universal access to ARV drug treatment, said the government and its partners had been steadily increasing the number of people getting treatment, but that more needed to be done, the state-controlled Herald newspaper reported on Wednesday. The minister said the total number currently receiving ARV drug therapy had risen to some 80,000 compared with about 50,000 last December. An estimated 300,000 need the drugs, Dr. Parirenyatwa said, though some HIV/AIDS activists place the number closer to a half million people. Director Tendayi Kureya of the Development Data Trust, who was present at the workshop, told reporter Ndimyake Mwakalyelye of VOA's Studio 7 for Zimbabwe that he believes the figure of 80,000 accurately reflects the number on ARV therapy.

The infant died of bacteremia, commonly known as blood poisoning after acquiring serratia, a harmful pathogen that causes severe infections in babies, Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control said Wednesday. The infant, weighing between one and three pounds, died over the weekend. Email to a friend A second baby has also tested positive for serratia and is in isolation but not seriously ill. The infant's death has prompted special infection control procedures, including improved hand hygiene and the wearing of gowns and gloves in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Drinking just one cup of tea a day will lower your risk of getting the two most common types of skin cancer: squamos and basal cell carcinoma, according to the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. "Teas have long been known to contain antioxidants in them, and also chemicals called polyfenals," says dermatologist Dr. Bryan Chen. In the first human study of more than 2,000 people tea's antioxidants were found to limit the effects of the sun's ultraviolet rays. But Doctor Chen says tea isn't the cure all for skin cancer. "Just because you drink tea doesn't mean it's a 100% protection against the development of skin cancer. You really do need to do it in combination with other protective measures protect yourself from the sun." Scientists found the more tea you drink, each day and over the years, the better the skin protection. It doesn't matter if the tea is hot or cold, and all types of tea offered protection, including green, black and herbal tea.

Usually in the country of Canada if an elderly person breaks their hip, they are operated on the same day or the day after, but a new study shows that those who have to wait up to 4 days to be operated on are at risk of complications and death. A report released by The Canadian Institute for Health Information, finds that in 2005 and 2006, approximately 17 thousand surgeries were performed in patients over the age of 65, not including Quebec. About 6% of these patients died in hospital within 30 days of their admission. The mortality risk for patients who waited 4 days or more after being admitted to hospital for hip surgery was 22% higher than it was for patients who received surgery the same day or one day after the injury occured. "Hip fractures represent a tremendous health burden for seniors. Recovery is often slow and painful, and many patients experience a loss of mobility and other health problems," says Dr. Michael Dunbar, associate professor of Orthopedic Surgery at Dalhousie University.

It has been scientifically concluded that a 100 per cent smoke-free environment is the only way out from the devastating effects of second hand tobacco smoke. A smoke-free inside creates an enjoyable, healthy lifestyle and a prosperous future. For this, all indoor workplaces must be smoke free. Evidences show that if we are able to restrict tobacco consumption, health-related ailments will go down drastically, which in the long run reduces the burden of poverty. World No Tobacco Day is an annual advocacy event commemorated by the member states of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to mark the global tobacco free initiative. The theme of the day is chosen each year on the basis of the emerging public health problem caused by the untoward effects of tobacco. Global health faces enormous challenges from a variety of tobacco products like cigarettes, bidi, gutkha and others. This year's global alert on second hand smoke-free environment is realistic from a variety of contexts. Of the 4.9 million global deaths from tobacco, countries in the South East Asia region accounts for 1.2 million. The smoke from burning tobacco products, generated by people smoking them, refers to second hand smoke. Breathing second hand tobacco smoke is detrimental to human health. When tobacco smoke contaminates the air, especially enclosed spaces, it is taken in by everyone present there. It exposes both smokers and non-smokers to maximum harmful effects. In this situation, people that are not actively smoking are also compelled to inhale smoke from tobacco products. A series of scientific evidences have shown that second hand tobacco is also believed to be a cause for cancer. Of the over 4,000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke, more than 50 are accountable for cancer in humans. Let aside the consequences of direct smoking, second hand smoke is also attributed to cardiovascular ailments and many serious types of respiratory and heart diseases, which might lead to death. Scientifically, it has been proved that neither ventilation nor filtration can reduce the impact of tobacco smoke exposure. In this regard, only 100 per cent smoke-free environment is an effective protection. Second hand smoking occurs anywhere, any time where smoking is permitted. Homes, offices, schools, colleges, workplaces and vehicles are such places. As per a recent WHO report, around 700 million children breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke. Home is believed to be the prime place for second hand smoke. Second hand smoke is a predisposing factor for the heavy global burden of diseases and unnecessary economic burden. Evidences accumulated over the last four decades reveal a bleak picture about the rising status of heart, lung cancer, asthma and other such diseases. Given this scenario, member countries wanting to place stricter control on tobacco consumption face hardships due to the low level of awareness about the health risks of tobacco. The tobacco industries are also trying their best to continue their onslaught with new products promoted as being safer and healthier. They come with healthier names or fruity flavours or a more attractive packaging. So long as we fail to empower our people, organisations and policymakers with accurate information about tobacco products, their forms and disguises, the high sounding propaganda against tobacco will do nothing. In our context, the Ministry of Health and Population, along with its subordinate wing, the National Health Education, Information and Communication Centre (NHEICC), is entrusted with implementing the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and other precautionary ways for creating mass awareness. But it is an irony that smoking has not gone down. The FCTC is a global public health treaty developed in response to the globalisation of the tobacco epidemic aimed at reducing the burden of diseases caused by tobacco consumption. It provides for the widest possible international co-operation necessary to control illnesses caused by the consumption of tobacco and a sharp rise in poverty. So far, 125 countries have ratified the convention, but in our case, nothing concrete has been achieved in this regard. Due to government's indifference towards the FCTC, the pace of development in the field of tobacco control has been lagging behind. Who is to blame for the non-implementation of the FCTC? Besides, the health tax fund raised from cigarettes has not been properly utilised.

The proposals from the European Commission did not go far enough for the British Medical Association, which urged a system of presumed consent so that organs could be used from all potential donors unless an individual had opted out." /> Euro donor card &lsquo;could solve organ crisis&rsquo;-Life & Style-Health-TimesOnline Our exclusive four-step guide to giving up before the ban Navigation - link to other main sections from here No wonder I'll die alone. All I do is ask questions Euro donor card &lsquo;could solve organ crisis&rsquo; David Charter in Brussels Proposals for a European organ donor card, to tackle record waiting lists for transplants, emerged yesterday after figures showed that ten people died every day while waiting for a transplant in Europe. The proposals from the European Commission did not go far enough for the British Medical Association, which urged a system of presumed consent so that organs could be used from all potential donors unless an individual had opted out. In Britain, where the waiting list for organs reached a record high of 7,234 at the end of March, nearly nine out of ten people believe that carrying a national donor card is a good idea, but only one in four people actually carries one. Britain also has one of the highest family refusal rates in the EU, with 42 per cent of relatives blocking organ removal, compared with 17 per cent in Spain, 29 per cent in Italy and 30 per cent in France. Only the Greeks were more reluctant among 12 nations surveyed, with 46 per cent of relatives telling doctors not to remove organs for transplant. John Oliver, of UK Transplant, the organisation that oversees organ donation, said: &ldquo;Britain&rsquo;s high relative refusal rate is the single biggest barrier to more lives being saved. Four out of ten people identified as suitable donors do not go on to donate because their relatives refuse. One of the main reasons is because the family, at a traumatic time, say they have never discussed it.&rdquo; Officials at the European Commission believe that a debate concerning an EU donor card would stimulate discussion in families so that people&rsquo;s wishes were well known. The BMA said: &ldquo;We would welcome any attempt to create public debate about the problem of organ shortages but we would prefer to see an opt-out system or presumed consent as part of a package of measures to improve the success of organ donation.&rdquo; Research released by the EU yesterday showed a big gap between those in member states who thought that carrying a donor card was a good idea (81 per cent) and those who carried a card. The Commission published its plans as a dispute intensified over a Dutch television programme, due to be broadcast tomorrow, in which a terminally ill patient will choose which of three people will receive her kidneys when she dies. Research showed that the Dutch were the most likely to carry organ donor cards. A total of 44 per cent carried their national card, compared with 26 per cent in Britain and an EU average of 12 per cent. Nobody in Hungary was found by researchers to be carrying a donor card. Markos Kyprianou, the EU Health Commissioner, will also discuss with member states whether a symbol showing an individual&rsquo;s willingness to donate organs should be included on the European health card &ndash; the card necessary for free treatment across the union. &ldquo;With eight out of ten Europeans favouring organ donor cards but only one in ten actually carrying one, there is clearly huge potential to increase the availability of organs for donation,&rdquo; Mr Kyprianou said.

The studies are published in today's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS, also known as slipped vertebra or slipped disk) is where one or more verterbra in the spine become misaligned and press on nerves in the spinal cord, resulting in severe leg pains. It generally occcurs after the age of 50. It affects around 600,000 Americans and is seen six times more often in women than in men; it is especially prevalent among African-American women. On its own DS is usually symptom-free, but sometimes it affects the spinal canal, making it narrower (spinal stenosis) which puts pressure on the nerves resulting in pain in the legs, such as when going for a walk. study, led by researchers at the Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire, US, showed that surgery was twice as effective as non-surgical treatment in reducing pain and helping patients with DS and spinal stenosis get back to normal. Before this study, there were no controlled trials on the effectiveness of surgery to treat DS with spinal stenosis. The researchers recruited 607 patients from 13 medical centres in 11 US states who had at least 12 weeks of symptoms which had been confirmed as DS. They were assigned to either a randomized cohort or an observational cohort. The outcomes were measured using a range of medical, disability, general health and pain assessment questionnaires at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and at 1 and 2 years. The results showed that 372 patients had surgery within two years (decompressive laminectomy, with or without fusion) and 235 had non-surgical treatments that included physical therapy, steroid injections, and drugs. Two years after enrollment, patients who had received surgical treatment reported significantly reduced pain and improved functionality as early as six weeks after intervention, while those who did not receive surgery reported only modest improvements. The researchers concluded that: "In nonrandomized as-treated comparisons with careful control for potentially confounding baseline factors, patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis treated surgically showed substantially greater improvement in pain and function during a period of 2 years than patients treated nonsurgically." Sciatica is often caused by displaced spinal disks putting pressure on the sciatic nerve resulting in painful burning sensations or numbness down one side of the body, mostly in the leg. 75 per cent of cases resolve on their own without surgery, but worldwide around 1.5 million operations are carried out to remove all or part of the disk to relieve the pressure on the sciatic nerve. study, led by Dutch researchers based at Leiden University Medical Center, showed that microdiskectomy surgery relieved pain faster than conservative treatments based on physical therapy and drugs, although 95 per cent of sciatica patients were free of pain within 12 months whether they had surgery or not. Patients with sciatica are often referred to surgery if the symptoms persist more than 6 weeks, but there is little well researched information on the best time to have the operation. The researchers randomly assigned 283 patients who had been experiencing severe sciatica symptoms for 6 to 12 weeks to one of two groups. The first group was referred for early surgery while the second group had prolonged conservative treatment (physical therapy and drugs), with surgery if needed. Both groups were monitored using questionnaires about disability, leg pain, and perceived recovery in the first year of the trial. 125 (89 per cent) of the 141 patients referred for early surgery had a microdiskectomy after an average of 2.2 weeks. 55 (39 per cent) of the 142 patients who were referred for prolonged conservative treatment had surgery after an average of 18.7 weeks. The results showed no difference in overall disability scores during the first year. However, relief from leg pain was faster among the early surgery patients, and this group also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery. But after one year of follow up, the percentage of patients who described themselves as recovered was the same, at 95 per cent. The researchers concluded that: "The 1-year outcomes were similar for patients assigned to early surgery and those assigned to conservative treatment with eventual surgery if needed, but the rates of pain relief and of perceived recovery were faster for those assigned to early surgery."

Meanwhile, Indonesian Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari repeated her earlier statement that drug manufacturer Baxter Healthcare Corp. planned to start clinical trials of a bird flu vaccine in the country in July. A spokesman for Baxter previously denied the company had announced such a plan, and refused to comment further. The company has previously announced clinical trials of vaccines in Europe. Supari, reached Thursday after Baxter&#039;s comment, said in a statement: "I don&#039;t know about that (the Baxter denial), what I know is that this July clinical trials will start." The country&#039;s latest bird flu victim came from a village in central Java province, said Muhammad Nadirin, an official at the Health Ministry. The 45-year-old died Monday after being hospitalized for two days, he said. Today in Asia - Pacific Thailand facing uncertainty after court ruling An escapee tells of life and death in North Korea&#x27;s labor camps U.S. and India closer to nuclear agreement Nadirin said the man had slaughtered, cooked, then eaten an infected chicken a week before he developed bird flu symptoms on May 17. The man&#039;s death raised Indonesia&#039;s total number of bird flu infections to 98 &#8212; 78 of them fatal &#8212; since the virus re-emerged in Asia in 2003. Bird flu remains essentially an animal disease, but experts fear it may mutate into a form easily transferrable between humans and trigger a global pandemic, possibly killing millions. The vaccines currently under production may offer some protection against any pandemic strain, but there is no guarantee. Experts say it could take six months before they could be adjusted to provide full protection. In February, Baxter signed a memorandum of understanding with Indonesia for development of a bird flu vaccine using the Indonesian strain of the virus, but no formal deal has been signed yet. Supari told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Baxter&#039;s "clinical trial involving hundreds of participants will start in July" and should be concluded by October.

Three of the men were suspected of drugging male victims and abusing them during "sex parties," district police chief Ronald Zwarter said at a news conference Wednesday. "The suspicion is that, at these parties, they had unsafe sex with people they had drugged, and also that these people were injected with infected blood," Zwarter said. The four suspects &#8212; all of whom have HIV, the virus that causes AIDS &#8212; were arrested May 13, he said. Two of the suspects have confessed to injecting the victims, he said. "The motive to do this was the &#039;kick,&#039; and the feeling that unsafe sex is &#039;pure,&#039;" Zwarter said. Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy Prosecution spokesman Paul Heidanus said Thursday that the two who confessed would face charges of rape and "premeditated severe assault," which carries a maximum sentence of 16 years in prison. He said they would not be charged with attempted murder "because of a Supreme Court ruling that found AIDS should no longer be seen as an inevitably fatal disease, but rather a chronic illness," Heidanus said. The investigation was still ongoing to determine exactly what crimes might have been committed by the third suspect, who Heidanus said was "involved in the sex parties." The fourth suspect would face drugs charges for allegedly selling "a considerable amount of drugs," including Ecstasy and GHB, an intoxicant that is sometimes known as a "date rape" drug, police said in a statement. The fourth man was not suspected of involvement in the rapes, Heidanus said. The arrests followed complaints from at least five men who said they had been raped. "The victims said they had had been made helpless or unconscious and then abused," a police statement said. "They had ... involuntary and unsafe sex with one or more of the suspects." All of the victims said they believed they had been infected with HIV as a result. A judge on May 16 ordered the suspects be held for 90 days. Police said they did not rule out further arrests, and urged other victims to come forward or to contact a help line to receive HIV testing.

As VOA's Jessica Berman reports, the international bodies say health providers should offer to test people instead of waiting for patients to request HIV tests. A young HIV-infected woman lying in an Abidjan hospital In issuing new guidelines, UNAIDS and the WHO said 80 percent of people who are infected with the virus that causes AIDS are unaware of their situation. An estimated 40 million people throughout the world are living with HIV. More than 60 percent live in Africa. Kevin De Cock, the director of the HIV/AIDS program at the World Health Organization, says the guidelines are essential if people are to be treated. "We think these new guidelines are extremely important as we struggle to move towards universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support which the countries of the world have committed to," he said. Instead of waiting for patients at walk-in clinics and hospitals to request HIV tests, Paul De Lay of UNAIDS, says the guidelines urge health care workers to offer HIV tests as a routine part of medical care. "It encourages health care providers to recommend an HIV test to people who show symptoms of illness, or who likely benefit in health terms from an HIV test," he said. But the officials say under no circumstances should people be coerced into taking a test, nor should one be administered without their consent. The officials say those who test positive must also receive counseling afterward. In addition to getting AIDS treatment they might ordinarily not receive, De Cock says people who know their HIV status are less likely to spread the infection to others. "There are data from the United States certainly showing safer behavior once people know their HIV infection status. Because the overwhelming majority of HIV-infected people wish to do everything they can to prevent transmission to others," he said. Experts say it is unclear how the recommendations for HIV testing will be received in cash-strapped nations, particularly in Africa. According to one expert, the health care systems in many countries are in disarray, and many people who are HIV-positive fail to seek care until they are very sick.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/19-3&fd=R&url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/lifestyle/2007-05/30/content_883678.htm&cid=1116798088&ei=m-xeRuzZAoL0rQOB45zVDQ Natural compound in grapes, tea and cocoa helps boost memory Natural compound in grapes, tea and cocoa helps boost memory A study of mice has shown that a natural compound found in blueberries, tea, grapes, and cocoa has the potential to enhance memory, and that its effects further increase when combined with regular exercise. A study of mice has shown that a natural compound found in blueberries, tea, grapes, and cocoa has the potential to enhance memory, and that its effects further increase when combined with regular exercise. The compound pointed at by the researchers is epicatechin, one of a group of chemicals known as flavonols that has been shown previously to improve cardiovascular function in people and increase blood flow in the brain. In the latest study, Dr. Henriette van Praag of the California based Salk Institute for Biological Studies and her colleagues found that the combination of exercise, and a diet with epicatechin promoted structural and functional changes in the dentate gyrus, a part of the brain involved in the formation of learning and memory. Published in The Journal of Neuroscience, their findings suggest that a diet rich in flavonols may help reduce the incidence or severity of neurodegenerative disease or cognitive disorders related to ageing. "This finding is an important advance because it identifies a single natural chemical with memory-enhancing effects, suggesting that it may be possible to optimize brain function by combining exercise and dietary supplementation," says Dr. Mark Mattson at the National Institute on Ageing. The researchers compared mice who were fed a typical diet with those given a diet supplemented with epicatechin. Half the mice in each group were made to run on a wheel for two hours each day. After a period of one month, the researchers trained mice to find a platform hidden in a pool of water. They noticed that mice who both exercised and ate the epicatechin diet remembered the location of the platform longer than the other mice. Upon a study of the brains of these mice, the researchers observed a greater blood vessel growth in the dentate gyrus and a more mature nerve cells, an indication of enhanced ability of the cells to communicate. The researchers further said that the combination of epicatechin and exercise had a beneficial effect on the expression of genes important for learning and memory, and decreased the activity of genes playing a role in inflammation and neurodegeneration. They say that though sedentary mice fed epicatechin showed enhanced memory, blood vessel growth, and gene activity during the study, such benefits were even more evident in mice that also exercised. "A logical next step will be to study the effects of epicatechin on memory and brain blood flow in aged animals, and then humans, combined with mild exercise, " says van Praag.

Despite the sub-Saharan country being crippled by economic crisis and deep recession, health workers have been praised for their efforts to keep the HIV prevalence rate down. Since 2001, the number of people infected by the disease in the country has fallen from 25 per cent to just 18.1 per cent of the population. According to reports, the number of people who will have regular access to anti-retroviral treatments will increase by 40,000 in December, having already risen from 60,000 to 80,000 this month. Zimbabwe&#39;s health minister David Parirenyatwa said this week: "Currently the number of people on ARVs has grown to 80,000 since December last year and we hope to achieve our target of getting 120,000 by the end of the year." Meanwhile, government officials in Zimbabwe are expected to attend a conference on human trafficking which is set to kick off this week. The three-day event in will focus on the problem of human trafficking in southern and will bring together representatives from 14 countries on the continent.

Ronald Krall, chief medical officer, wrote in the letter that Glaxo did a "meta analysis" similar to the one conducted by Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Steven Nissen, whose article in the New England Journal of Medicine last week linked the drug to a potentially increased risk of heart attacks. Glaxo's own meta-analysis also found indications of increased risk, Dr. Krall wrote, but he said the number of adverse events was low. Dr. Krall also discussed results from two large Glaxo-funded studies of the drug. Neither trial, called Dream and Adopt, was designed primarily to assess the drug's heart risks. But Glaxo's analysis of the Adopt trial showed major adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, were "rare," and heart risks were similar to those of two other diabetes drugs. The Dream trial also showed "no significant difference" in cardiovascular events between the drug and placebo, the letter said. Meanwhile, an independent safety board recently reviewed an interim analysis of an ongoing study, Record, designed specifically to assess the drug's impact on the heart. The board determined the trial should continue, the Glaxo letter said. In an interview, Christopher Viehbacher, Glaxo's president of U.S. pharmaceuticals, said the trial's interim results were "giving us the confidence to say that we stand behind this product." He said there is a chance the interim results will become public before the Record trial is complete, though the trade-off would be that the publicity could weaken the statistical power of the final results. Mr. Viehbacher said it wouldn't surprise the company if the Food and Drug Administration were to call for "some labeling changes" for Avandia. One possibility would be elevating a heart-failure warning on the label to a more severe "black box" warning, he said. Dr. Nissen criticized Glaxo's letter to the Lancet, saying the company was slicing the data differently from the Adopt and Dream results originally published. Dr. Nissen also said the company was referring to such small subsets of data in the Adopt and Dream trials, that no firm conclusion could be drawn. "Somebody went back and looked for something that would support their contention," Dr. Nissen said. "This is not a scientifically proper way to analyze data." Mr. Viehbacher said that after Dr. Nissen's article was published last week, "we were shouting in a gale-force wind blowing against us." Now, he said, the public-relations situation was improving.

Dutch police arrested four men in connection with the case in the northern city of Groningen earlier this month. They include a gay couple from the city of Slochteren, both aged 48, and a 33-year-old gay man from Groningen. The three are suspected of organizing sex parties where they injected victims with HIV-contaminated blood taken from themselves. Two of them have admitted that they arranged dates with gay men through Internet chat rooms. At the parties, they secretly spiked the drinks of the victims with GHB, commonly known as the "date rape drug", sometimes in combination with ecstasy. The victims were then sexually abused and injected with infected blood. The Dutch public prosecution department has charged the three with rape and serious assault. They could face a maximum penalty of 16 years in prison. "The life expectancy of the victims can be extended with medication and as a result the suspects cannot be charged with manslaughter or murder," the spokesperson for the prosecution office explained. This means that even if it were certain that one or more of their victims would eventually die of AIDS as a direct result of the injections, the offenders will not be convicted of murder. The fourth man, a 34-year-old drug dealer from Groningen, is suspected of supplying the GHB and ecstasy. He was found to be in possession of a large amount of drugs. The other three suspects also have the drugs. The sex parties took place in the homes of the suspects or their victims. According to the police, the suspects did it just for fun and because they found unprotected sex to be "pure". The suspects had also injected one another with their infected blood. Five victims between the ages of 25 and 50 have reported to the police so far, of whom four have filed charges. The police said some of them have become HIV-positive as a result of the injections. Twelve men have reported to the regional health authority in Groningen that they were possibly infected with HIV during gay parties in the city. It is not known whether the men have actually been infected. Police suspect that there are more victims and are calling on them to report to the authorities. Last year the Groningen health authority noticed an increase in HIV infections and warned homosexuals against visiting these parties.

Barack Obama, D-Ill., talks with Dr. Mark Anderson while touring a cardiology research lab before speaking about his health care plan, Tuesday, at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. IOWA CITY, Iowa &#8211; Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama on Tuesday offered a plan to provide health care to millions of Americans and more affordable medical insurance, financed in part by tax increases on the wealthy. Bemoaning a health care &#8220;cost crisis,&#8221; Obama said it was unacceptable that 47 million in the country are uninsured while others are struggling to pay their medical bills. He said the time is ripe for reforming the health care system despite an inability to do so in the past, most notably when rival Hillary Rodham Clinton pursued major changes during her husband's presidency. Michelle Obama razzes her husband, but says he doesn't mind &#8220;We can do this,&#8221; Obama said in a speech in Iowa City at the University of Iowa's medical school. &#8220;The climate is far different than it was the last time we tried this in the early nineties.&#8221; Obama's plan retains the private insurance system but injects additional money to pay for expanding coverage. Those who can't afford coverage would get a subsidy on a sliding scale depending on their income, and virtually all businesses would have to share in the cost of coverage for their workers. Obama didn't mention that his plan would cost the federal treasury an estimated $50 billion to $65 billion a year once fully implemented. That information was provided in a memo written by three outside experts and distributed by the campaign after his speech. The experts also said Obama could pay for his plan mostly through steps that the candidate has already said he would take &#8211; allowing President Bush's tax cuts on dividends and capital gains and on those making more than about $250,000 a year to expire in 2010 instead of acting to make them permanent. The rest of the $65 billion funding could come by raising taxes on inheritances worth more than $7 million. Many Democrats want to repeal Bush's elimination of taxes on estates worth more than $1 million. Obama wants the exemption to be higher but has not yet said exactly where it should be set. Obama's proposal would spend more money boosting technology in the health industry such as electronic record-keeping. His package would prohibit insurance companies from refusing coverage because of pre-existing conditions. It would also create a National Health Insurance Exchange to monitor insurance companies and limit their profits. Obama said the typical consumer would save $2,500 a year on premiums. Obama's first promise as a presidential candidate was that he would sign a universal health care plan into law by the end of his firm term in the White House. But there is some dispute over whether his plan would provide universal care &#8211; it's aimed at lowering costs so all Americans can afford insurance, but does not guarantee everyone would buy it. &#8220;It's not totally clear that it would result in universal coverage,&#8221; said Ron Pollack, executive director of the advocacy group Families USA. He praised Obama and other leading Democratic candidates for focusing on improving health care. &#8220;What makes it a top national priority now is not simply a sense of sympathy for people who are uninsured but a sense of fear that the coverage that used to be taken for granted can no longer be taken for granted,&#8221; he said. Obama aides said they believe that everyone would buy health insurance if it were affordable enough, achieving universal care. If some Americans are still uninsured after a few years into the plan, Obama would reconsider how to get to 100 percent, the advisers said. That's where he differs with Democratic rival John Edwards, the only other candidate who has laid out a specific plan. Edwards eventually would require every American to get health insurance, much like state requirements that drivers have auto insurance. Obama would only require that children be covered. Edwards spokesman Mark Kornblau said Edwards' plan, estimated to cost between $90 billion and $120 billion annually, is &#8220;truly universal.&#8221; &#8220;He believes that incremental measures are not enough,&#8221; Kornblau said. &#8220;Any plan that does not cover all Americans is simply inadequate.&#8221; In a CNN-Opinion Research poll conducted earlier this month, about two-thirds said the government should provide national health insurance for all Americans, even if it would mean higher taxes. Clinton has promised universal health care but has yet to provide specifics. Associated Press Writer Nedra Pickler in Washington contributed to this report.

New legislation to ban smoking in public would be a key step forward, the ministry said in the newly released 2007 Report on China's Smoking Control. The report, the nation's first official report on smoke control, was released before today's World No Tobacco Day. China now has no laws designed specifically to ban smoking in public. The law on tobacco monopolies, which came into effect in 1991, prohibited smoking on public transport and some other areas. However, the law was not strictly enforced. China is the world's largest tobacco producing and consuming country, accounting for more than a third of the global total on both counts. The tobacco industry has been the biggest tax source since 1987, which accounted for about 240 billion yuan (US$31.4 billion) of tax revenue in 2005, according to the report. About 540 million Chinese suffer from passive smoking and more than 100,000 of them die annually from diseases caused by passive smoking, according to the report. Among passive smoking victims, about 180 million were children younger than 15, the report said. The World Health Organization estimated that about 700 million children worldwide suffered from passive smoking. People in rural areas were more inclined to fall prey to passive smoking as 54 percent had contact with second-hand smoke, the report said. In urban areas, the number was 49.7 percent. More than half the population in 20 provinces across China were exposed to passive smoking while the figures in the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Jilin, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were above 60 percent, the report said. Homes were found to offer the easiest access to second-hand smoking. This was the finding of a 2002 survey where 82 percent of the respondents agreed, the report said. The report also revealed that a cigarette can produce more than 4,000 chemical substances when it is lit, including more than 40 carcinogens such as formaldehyde, benzene and arsenic. Second-hand smoking has been identified as an A-level carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a body under WHO.

The letter ``clarifies the safety record of Avandia,&#39;&#39; Glaxo said today in a statement. Glaxo shares have dropped about 9.3 percent, wiping out almost 7.88 billion pounds ($15.6 billion) in market value, since a May 21 report in the New England Journal of Medicine said that patients taking Avandia, the company&#39;s second-best-selling drug, were 43 percent more likely to have a heart attack. Glaxo Chief Medical Officer Ronald Krall said in the letter today that studies in progress will provide more information on safety. ``The drug use and approval system is working,&#39;&#39; Krall wrote. ``We should stay the course and allow ongoing trials to provide their definitive answers.&#39;&#39; The stock rose 22 pence, or 1.7 percent, to 1,328 pence in London. Earlier today, the shares had declined as much as 2.8 percent after analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co., the world&#39;s biggest brokerage, recommended investors sell the stock because of the reported heart risks. ``Although these findings seem scientifically questionable to us and are unlikely to support near-term product withdrawal or major litigation, we believe that share price risks are nonetheless skewed to the downside,&#39;&#39; Merrill Lynch analysts, including Graham Parry, wrote today in a research note. Avandia&#39;s share of new oral diabetes prescriptions fell to about zero from 10 percent in the two days after publication of the New England Journal article, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a research note yesterday, citing data from market research firm Impact Rx. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.&#39;s diabetes drug Actos&#39; share climbed to 22 percent from 10 percent, the analysts wrote. Takeda shares reached a two-month high today after the Deutsche Bank report. The stock gained 90 yen, or 1.1 percent, to 8,020 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. ImpactRx disagrees with Deutsche Bank&#39;s interpretation of its data, the market research firm said yesterday in a PR Newswire press release. ``We believe insufficient time has elapsed since publication and it&#39;s premature to conclude any dramatic or lasting changes in physician prescribing behavior at this point,&#39;&#39; Impact Rx President and Chief Executive Officer Richard Altus said in the statement. Analysts have expected new Avandia prescriptions to decline since last week. Some doctors who treat diabetes report they are considering treatment alternatives for newly diagnosed patients. ``I don&#39;t think people will be pulled off drugs because of it,&#39;&#39; Rury Holman, professor of diabetic medicine and director of the Diabetes Trials Unit at Oxford University, who has done clinical trials for Glaxo, said in a telephone interview today. ``I think you will see new starts will go down.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporter on this story: Andrea Gerlin in London Last Updated: May 30, 2007 12:56 EDT Related Media on Demand Steven Nissen Sees Concern For Glaxo&#39;s Avandia Drug FTSE 100 Stocks Advance, Led by Johnson Matthey, HBOS, BHP Billion Shares Altadis Default Swaps Fall on Speculation of New Bid From Imperial Tobacco Man Group Reports 27 Percent Jump in Full-Year Profit as Assets Increase

In line with the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, government is finalising commitment documents to make Uganda smoke-free. The convention demands government commitment to compel manufacturers to label cigarettes with a bigger and clearer warning that tobacco kills and to make them contribute to the rehabilitation of addicted smokers. Tobacco is dangerous to every organ in the body. According to WHO, it is the second major cause of death in the world. Every eight seconds someone somewhere is killed as a result of tobacco use. It is currently responsible for the death of one in 10 adults worldwide (about 5 million deaths each year). If current smoking patterns continue, it will cause some 10 million deaths each year by 2020. Half the people that smoke today - that is about 650 million people - will eventually be killed by tobacco. Passive smoking is even more dangerous. It is a killer. In spite of the fact that Uganda has a law against smoking in public, it is not enforced because most of the public, who should play a watchdog role, are ignorant of the dangers of passive smoking. Children exposed to second-hand smoking are at increased rate of sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems, cancer and more severe asthma. The only sure protection is to have a smoke-free environment. It is even not viable to carve out smoke zones because smoke will float to non-smokers in the same zone. There is need to create supportive laws and to sensitise the public so that those who abuse the law are sued for compensation. Proprietors of public places must hang up clear signs of &#39;No Smoking&#39; and enforce it. The National Bureau of Standards should enforce international standard labels which are big, pictorial and mention death. Government and stakeholders must also provide economically viable alternatives to tobacco growers. Let us all work to make Uganda smoke-free. &copy; 2007 New Vision. All rights reserved.

The results, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine , also reports that regular consumption of the nuts led to reductions in cholesterol levels, and may offer a " practical, safe and inexpensive modality to reduce blood pressure," "In this eight-week crossover trial, soy nuts containing 25 g of soy protein and 101 mg of aglycone lowered blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women compared with the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet without soy," wrote lead author Francine Welty, from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston. "To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly compare the effects of a whole soy food in normotensive and hypertensive individuals." In the UK alone, there are an estimated 10m people with , defined as having blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg. The condition is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which causes almost 50 per cent of deaths in Europe, and is reported to cost the EU economy an estimated &#8364;169bn ($202bn) per year. The new study recruited 60 healthy post-menopausal women (average age 56, average BMI 26.7 kg per sq m) and assigned them to eat two diets for eight weeks each in random order. The first diet, the TLC diet, consisted of 30 per cent of calories from fat (with 7 per cent or less from saturated fat), 15 per cent from protein and 55 per cent from carbohydrates; 1,200 milligrams of calcium per day; two meals of fatty fish (such as salmon or tuna) per week; and less than 200 milligrams of cholesterol per day. The second diet had the same calorie, fat and protein content, but the 25 grams of protein was replaced with one-half cup of unsalted soy nuts. The researchers took blood samples and pressure measurements at the beginning and end of each eight-week period. At the beginning of the study, 12 women were classed as hypertensive, with the remaining 48 being normotensive. "Soy nut supplementation significantly reduced systolic [top number] and diastolic [bottom number] blood pressure in all 12 hypertensive women and in 40 of the 48 normotensive women," Indeed, hypertensive women consuming the soy nuts as part of the TLC diet experienced systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions of 9.9 per cent and 6.8 per cent, respectively, while normotensive women experienced reductions and 5.2 per cent and 2.9 per cent, respectively. "A 12-millimetre of mercury decrease in systolic blood pressure for 10 years has been estimated to prevent one death for every 11 patients with stage one hypertension treated; therefore, the average reduction of 15 milligrams of mercury in systolic blood pressure in hypertensive women in the present study could have significant implications for reducing cardiovascular risk and death on a population basis," In addition to blood pressure reductions, the women with high blood pressure at the start of the study also experienced beneficial changes in levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL - "bad") cholesterol and apoliprotein B (a particle that carries LDL cholesterol), with reductions reported of 11 and eight per cent, respectively. "Levels of triglyceride were seven per cent and 11 per cent lower in normotensive and hypertensive women, respectively, in the soy diet arm compared with the control arm," "Although these reductions were not statistically significant, their magnitude is similar to reductions in triglyceride levels observed in other soy studies and may have clinical relevance, especially since triglyceride levels are stronger predictors of cardiovascular risk in women than in men." The researchers suggest that the isoflavone content of the soy nuts may be responsible for the beneficial changes to blood pressure, but also not that when provided in isolation in the form of supplements, similar benefits were not observed in other studies, suggesting that isoflavones may work synergistically. "This study was performed in the free-living state; therefore, dietary soy may be a practical, safe and inexpensive modality to reduce blood pressure. If the findings are repeated in a larger group they may have important implications for reducing cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women on a population basis," Archives of Internal Medicine Volume 167, Pages 1060-1067 "Effect of Soy Nuts on Blood Pressure and Lipid Levels in Hypertensive, Prehypertensive, and Normotensive Postmenopausal Women" Authors: F.K.

That leaves many patients worried that they will get worse if they don't have surgery&#151;yet uncomfortably short of information to help them decide if surgery is worth the risks. Now, that murky picture is brightening: In the past six months, three studies have made it much clearer when back surgery is a good option. The bottom line: It all depends on what's wrong. People with sciatica, in which a disk in the lower back presses on nerve roots and causes sharp pain in a leg or foot, might want to wait and see, for example. Most people with sciatica get better within three months, with or without surgery. People With Sciatica Felt Better Faster With Surgery For Spinal Stenosis, Surgery Works Well In the study, patients showed equal improvement after one year whether they had surgery or used such noninvasive approaches as painkillers and exercise. But those who had surgery to remove the piece of bulging disk early on, six to 12 weeks after the beginning of symptoms, said their leg pain got better faster, researchers at Leiden University in the Netherlands reported in the May 31 New England Journal of Medicine . And about 40 percent of the patients who didn't get early surgery later went on to have an operation. For those whose pain persists, a faster recovery may be worth the pain and risk of complications from surgery. A second study found that surgery seems to be a good bet for people with degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. In this tongue-numbing diagnosis, a vertebra slips out of alignment and presses on the spinal cord, and the bony canal in the spinal column is narrowed by arthritis, pinching nerves. This causes pain in the back or legs that gradually becomes worse. The condition is common in older people and is the No. 2 cause of back surgery in the United States, after herniated disks. The surgery typically involves fusing two vertebrae together and removing bone and soft tissue pressing on nerves. James Weinstein, an orthopedic surgeon at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center who led the study, says he was surprised that the patients who avoided surgery didn't do better. In a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last November, Weinstein and his colleagues found that people with pain due to a herniated disk did just as well after a year with or without surgery. "Age is an issue here," says Weinstein, noting that people with slipped disks are typically in their 40s and thus may recover faster on their own.

US health officials Tuesday urged hundreds of travelers aboard two Air France and Czech Air flights be tested for a drug-resistant tuberculosis carried by a passenger now quarantined US health officials Tuesday urged that hundreds of travelers aboard two Air France and Czech Air flights be tested for a drug-resistant tuberculosis carried by a passenger now quarantined. Julie Gerberding, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told reporters that the drug-resistant XDR strain of tuberculosis can cause severe illness or death. "Most likely to be at risk would be the passengers who were seated in seats immediately close to the patient," she said, recommending these passengers and flight crews be tested for exposure. "The medical evidence would suggest this potential for transmission would be on the low side, but we know it isn't zero," she said. The infected passenger traveled on Air France flight A385 from Atlanta to Paris on May 12, and on a Czech Air flight from Prague to Montreal on May 24. A US citizen, the man has been placed in isolation in a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, Gerberding said. It was the first time since 1963 the CDC issued such an order, a spokesman for the centers said. "We always want to balance personal liberties with the requirement to protect people's health," Gerberding said. "We felt it was our responsibility to err on the side of abundant caution and issue the isolation order." The CDC is "collaborating with US state and local health departments, international ministries of health, the airline industry and the World Health Organization," the CDC said. Canada's director general of the Public Health Agency's infectious disease and emergency preparedness branch, Howard Njoo, told reporters an estimated 200 people were aboard the Czech Air flight to Montreal. He said that after landing at Montreal, the patient rented a car and drove to the United States by way of the Champlain-New York border crossing. Njoo said the patient had apparently been told he was infected with TB before leaving Europe, but was unaware it involved the virulent XDR strain. The CDC reported that the patient was in good health and showed no TB symptoms such as coughing or fever, said Njoo, adding that the patient's relatives had all tested negative for TB. An analysis of the patient's sputum also tested negative, indicating a very low level of contagion, said the Canadian official. Echoing the CDC official, Njoo said the risk of contracting the disease even for people seated next to the patient was "minimal" since re-circulated air in aircraft is filtered for germs. Only two cases of XDR TB have been reported in Canada, in 2003 and 2006, he said. Air France officials, meanwhile, issued a brief statement saying they were "cooperating fully with all authorities involved and we are following all worldwide aviation practices for these matters." In September, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed 53 XDR TB cases in South Africa, all but one of them fatal, triggering a world-wide health alert. Most of the patients were also infected with the AIDS virus. More than 300 people have been diagnosed with XDR TB in South Africa, with an average of one new case per day, WHO said, adding that the TB strain has an 85 percent mortality rate when combined with the AIDS virus. Besides South Africa, more than 5,000 people in 18 other countries have been diagnosed with the virulent TB strain, but with a much lower mortality rate, WHO said. Tuberculosis, in all its variants, kills some two million people worldwide each year, mostly in developing countries. In the United States, TB is relatively rare, with only 13,700 cases reported last year.

Torisel was approved based on a study that showed use of the drug prolonged survival of patients with renal cell carcinoma. The drug is an enzyme inhibitor, a protein that regulates cell production, cell growth and cell survival. "We have made significant advances in the battle against kidney cancer,&rdquo; said Steven Galson, M.D., M.P.H., director of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Torisel is the third drug approved for this indication in the past 18 months, and one that shows an increased time in survival for some patients." The approval of Torisel follows the December 2005 approval of Nexavar (sorafenib), which was based on a delay in progression of disease. In January 2006, Sutent (sunitinib) received accelerated approval based on durable response rate, or tumor size reduction, and was later demonstrated to delay tumor progression. The safety and effectiveness of Torisel were shown in a clinical trial of 626 patients divided into three groups. One group received Torisel alone, another received a comparison drug called Interferon alfa, and a third received a combination of Torisel and interferon. The group of patients who received Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival. The median overall survival was 10.9 months for patients on Torisel alone versus 7.3 months for those treated with the interferon alone. Progression-free survival (when the disease does not get worse) increased from 3.1 months on the interferon alone arm to 5.5 months on the Torisel alone arm. The combination of Torisel and interferon did not result in a significant increase in overall survival when compared with interferon alone. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 30 percent of Torisel-treated patients, were rash, fatigue, mouth sores, nausea, edema, and loss of appetite. The most common laboratory abnormalities were high blood sugar, elevated blood lipids and triglycerides, elevated liver and kidney blood tests, and low red cell, white cell, and platelet counts. Renal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in about 51,000 people annually in the United States, accounts for about 85 percent of all U.S. adult kidney cancer.

Overall, the study by the Canadian Institute for Health Information found that nearly 25,000 seniors were admitted to hospital in Canada in 2005-2006 with a broken hip. Hospitalizations for hip fractures were down 13 per cent from five years earlier. But the report found that eight per cent of seniors admitted to hospitals outside Quebec with hip fractures spent four or more days in hospital before having surgery. Those who had to wait longer than the next day for surgery were 22 per cent more likely to die in hospital within 30 days of admission. "We find that there is a group that we could perhaps do a better job on," said Dr. Michael Dunbar, an orthopedic surgeon in Halifax who routinely sees elderly patients showing up in hospital in ``significant amounts of pain" after a fall. "We've identified some low-hanging fruit, a group that is waiting and subsequently is not having as good an outcome, particularly with respect to mortality. So it's an area where we could do better." Numerous factors can contribute to delays. Dunbar said they can occur because a patient has to be taken off blood-thinners before surgery, or may require a cardiac assessment first. Jennifer Zelmer, vice-president of research and analysis at CIHI, said the statistics were adjusted for these "patient factors," and the report revealed a number of other concerns related to wait times. "If you were transferred from one hospital to another, or if you're admitted to a larger hospital, or an afternoon or evening admit, or an admission on a weekday as opposed to a weekend, those patients were more likely to have their surgery later than others," said Zelmer, one of the authors of the report. The fact that surgery occurs more quickly when a person is admitted on a weekend might come as a surprise, but Zelmer said it has to do with the fact that someone is specifically on call on the weekend to handle trauma cases and can help a patient immediately. "Whereas on a weekday, they may be in the middle of a hip replacement, for example, or a scheduled surgery," she said. Dunbar agreed, noting that elective surgery isn't normally scheduled on weekends, so surgeons can start working on emergency cases such as fractured hips first thing in the morning. Broken hips are dealt with more quickly in small hospitals, the report found. "Seventy-four per cent, for example, got same day or next day surgery if they were admitted to a small hospital," Zelmer said. The number was 67 per cent for a medium or large community hospital, and 57 per cent for teaching hospitals. As for regional variations, those in Prince Edward Island, British Columbia and Nova Scotia were more likely to have surgery quickly, while patients in Manitoba and Saskatchewan were behind the national average. Health Minister Tony Clement noted that it's the first time CIHI has measured wait times for hip fracture surgery. "So before we didn't have a benchmark for this kind of surgery," he said. "We didn't have a specific target. But we can use this baseline information to measure how better or worse we do in the years ahead." The higher death rate among those who wait longer for surgery does not have have to do with problems in setting the bones, said Dunbar, but other factors. "Because you're immobilized, you're lying in bed, you can't move, you tend to get more urinary tract infections, you get more pneumonia because you can't get up and clear your lungs, you get pressure sores, and you get blood clots," he said. Dunbar pointed to the decline in the overall number of hip fractures â€“ adjusted for population aging and population growth â€“ as a positive thing. "What that says to me is our colleagues who have been working on prevention strategies like treating osteoporosis, identifying people at risk, working on fall prevention strategies, etc., have been effective in that they're reducing the incidence of hip fractures," he said.

The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) study released Wednesday found two-thirds of seniors who need surgery for a broken hip get it by the second day of admission to hospital. But eight per cent of Canadian seniors who have hip fractures, about 1,400 patients, wait four or more days for surgery. Email to a friend And, the report says, the longer the wait, the worse the outcome. "This is important new information," said Jennifer Zelmer, CIHI's vice-president of research and analysis, "because evidence suggests hip fracture patients who have surgery sooner tend to have better outcomes." The report says in 2005-06 there were 17,000 surgeries on patients over age 65 to repair broken hips in hospitals outside Quebec. Of these, 1,000 patients died in hospital within a month of admission. But the death rate for patients who waited longer for surgery was 22 per cent higher than for those who had it within two days of admission. The finding takes into account other factors affecting mortality such as age and other health problems, CIHI says. The report also found the quicker patients have surgery, the less time they will spend in hospital. Patients who had surgery on the day of admission or the following day spent an average of 18.5 days in hospital, compared to 20.5 days for those who waited longer. How quickly patients have hip fracture surgery varies across the country. Patients in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and British Columbia were more likely to have surgery with two days of admission. Those in Manitoba and Saskatchewan were least likely. The study says the rate of hospitalization for hip fracture surgery is declining across the country, from 575 surgeries per 100,000 seniors in 2000-01 to 502 per 100,000 in 2005-06. Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador had rates above the national average, while Manitoba, Quebec and Nova Scotia's were below.

The man had historical contacts with fowls as a number of his chicken died and he also consumed ill-chickens, Coordinator of anti-bird flu center Dr Runizar Roesin said. "Both of his laboratory tests showed that he was positive of H5N1," he told Xinhua. "The man died on May 28 in Dr Mawardi hospital in Solo of Central Java," Roesin said. He said the man was sick on May 17 and went to see a doctor, said the coordinator. On May 24 the patient was admitted to another hospital in the province, and two days later he was admitted to a hospital in Solo town, the official said. Sample of specimen of his family has been taken for examination of bird flu, said Roesin. Indonesia has agreed to resume sharing its virus sample with the World Health Organization for scientific purpose after suspending the cooperation in December last year. Experts fear millions of people could be killed should the virus mutate to a certain level that is transmittable among humans. The disease has killed at least 186 people worldwide since it began ravaging Asian poultry stocks in 2003, and 78 were in Indonesia, the worst hit country.

At least 21 people using Advanced Medical&#039;s Complete MoisturePlus eye solution were infected with a potentially blinding germ, U.S. regulators said. The recalled cleaner for contact lenses accounted for 11 percent of the company&#039;s 2006 sales. Advanced Medical withdrew its forecast that adjusted profit this year would reach $1.40 to $1.55 a share, Randy Meier, the company&#039;s chief financial officer, said in a conference call. The recall will make it harder for Advanced Medical to carry out its plan to enter a bidding war for a rival, Bausch &#038; Lomb, analysts said. "The recall increases their financing costs," said Mark Mullikin, an analyst with Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "I don&#039;t know that Advanced Medical shareholders will be willing to swallow that, and Bausch &#038; Lomb shareholders are less likely to want to take Advanced Medical stock as part of the deal." Shares of Bausch &#038; Lomb fell $2.48, or 3.5 percent, to $68.01 in afternoon trading in New York. The stock had jumped above $70 after Advanced Medical said it was considering an offer to compete with the bid of $3.67 billion, or $65 a share, by Warburg Pincus. Today in Marketplace by Bloomberg BA shares surge on takeover talk Toyota&#x27;s North American growth expected to exceed forecast Lower fees, more deals allow Europe to close in on Wall Street Advanced Medical shares dropped $4.80, or 11.94 percent, to $35.40 in afternoon trading in New York, rebounding from a 15 percent decline in the morning. The stock lost 5.3 percent Thursday and Friday after management disclosed plans to bid for Bausch &#038; Lomb. Jim Mazzo, the chief executive, on Tuesday declined to comment on Advanced Medical&#039;s plans to make an offer for Bausch &#038; Lomb. Adding Bausch &#038; Lomb would help the smaller Advanced Medical expand in the eye care market and eliminate a 154-year-old rival, company executives said last week Bausch &#038; Lomb is recovering from its own recall last year of the ReNu with MoistureLoc solution because of a link to a different kind of eye infection. The company eventually withdrew its product entirely after it was tied to the potentially blinding fusarium keratitis eye fungus. After first appearing in Singapore and Hong Kong, the illness affected more than 150 people in the United States. MoistureLoc, introduced in the autumn of 2004, was used by about 2.3 million of the 34 million contact lens users in the United States and was Bausch &#038; Lomb&#039;s fastest-growing product. Investor raises stake in VW as safeguard The German state of Lower Saxony, Volkswagen&#039;s second-largest investor, on Tuesday spent &#8364;41 million, or $55 million, purchasing 376,000 shares in the largest European carmaker to protect its holding as employees exercise options. "We have prevented a watering down of the state&#039;s holding below 20 percent with the corresponding purchase of VW shares," Lower Saxony&#039;s prime minister, Christian Wulff, said in a statement. The purchases gives the state "a key role in the decision-making should the company&#039;s future and its production in Lower Saxony be at stake." Lower Saxony paid &#8364;112.26 a share to raise its voting stake to 20.36 percent from 20.23 percent. Workers beginning in July will have the right to exercise options that would increase the number of shares on the market, she said. Volkswagen is protected from a takeover by a 47-year-old German law that gives anyone with a 20 percent holding the right to block major decisions at the carmaker. The law, which is being challenged at the European Union&#039;s highest court, also limits voting rights in 20 percent even if the holding is larger. Shares of Volkswagen rose &#8364;2.11 to &#8364;113.95 in Frankfurt. The stock has gained 33 percent this year, valuing the carmaker at &#8364;40.5 billion. Porsche, Volkswagen&#039;s largest investor, supports abolishing the law. An advocate general for the European Court of Justice this year advised the court to strike down the law because it restricted "the free movement of capital." A four-week offer period expired Tuesday for Volkswagen shareholders to tender their holdings to Porsche, the maker of the 911 sports car, in a low-ball takeover bid. Porsche designed the offer to attain a controlling stake in Volkswagen rather than full ownership.

The Canadian Institute for Health Information's annual Health Indicators 2007 report analyzed wait times for hip fracture surgery. "For the first time, we can compare how quickly seniors who break a hip in different parts of the country undergo surgery," Jennifer Zelmer, CIHIâ€™s vice-president of research and analysis, said in a release. "This is important new information, because evidence suggests that hip fracture patients who have surgery sooner tend to have better health outcomes." About eight per cent of seniors admitted to hospitals outside Quebec spent four or more days in hospital before having surgery, the report said. Nationally in 2005-2006, 65 per cent of patients on average had surgery the day they were admitted, or the next day. Patients in Manitoba (53 per cent) and Saskatchewan (56 per cent) wereÂ below the national average, while patients in Prince Edward Island (78 per cent), British Columbia (71 per cent) and Nova Scotia (69 per cent) wereÂ above. Slow, painful recoveryÂ for seniors Among patients who waited longer than the next day for surgery, the mortality rate within 30 days of admission was 22 per cent higher than for those who were treated sooner,Â after accounting for other factors such as age and other health problems. About 17,000 surgeries to repair hip fractures were done in patients 65 or older. In this group, 1,000 patients died, about six per cent. "Hip fractures represent a tremendous health burden for seniors," said Dr. Michael Dunbar, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Dalhousie University in Halifax. "Recovery is often slow and painful, and many patients experience a loss of mobility and other health problems." Research suggests that patients who wait longer for surgery to repair a broken hip are more likely to have complications, stay longer in hospital and show poorer recovery of function, Dunbar said. Osteoporosis, low physical activity, taking many medications, and a senior's physical surroundings are all linked with the risk of fracturing a hip, while fall-prevention strategies may help, said Greg Webster, a director of research at the institute. Hospitalization for hip fractures among seniors fell 13 per cent in five years,Â to 502Â hospitalizations per 100,000 seniors last year, down from 575 in 2000â€“2001, after taking population growth and aging into account.

The 31-year-old man walked into the facility wearing a mask around 8 a.m. and said he felt fine, Denver National Jewish Hospital spokesman William Allstetter said. Doctors plan to begin treating him immediately with two antibiotics, one oral and one intravenous. He also will undergo a basic physical exam, a test to evaluate how infectious he is and a CT scan and lung X-ray, Allstetter said. Doctors hope to also determine where he contracted the disease. He will be kept in a special unit with two rooms and a ventilation system, Allstetter said. "He may not leave that room much for several weeks," he said. The man, who has not been publicly identified beyond his age, knew he had TB when he flew from Atlanta to Europe in mid-May for his wedding and honeymoon, but he didn't find out until he was already there that it was an extensively drug-resistant strain considered especially dangerous. Despite warnings from federal health officials not to board another long flight, the man flew home for treatment. Health officials in North America and Europe are trying to track down about 80 passengers who sat near him on the two trans-Atlantic flights, and they want passenger lists from four shorter flights the man took while in Europe. Patients on the shorter flights are not expected to be as much at risk, health officials said. Among those being tested are more than two dozen University of South Carolina Aiken students, school spokeswoman Jennifer Lake said Thursday. Two were apparently sitting near the man, possibly in the same row, she said. One of those students, Laney Wiggins, said she is awaiting her skin test results, expected Friday. "I'm very nervous," Wiggins told The (Columbia) State newspaper. "It's kind of sad that this is overshadowing the wonderful time we had in Europe." The man flew to Paris on May 12 aboard Air France Flight 385, also listed as Delta Air Lines codeshare Flight 8517, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He and his bride also took four shorter flights while in Europe &mdash; Paris to Athens on May 14; Athens to Thira Island May 16; Mykonos Island to Athens May 21; and Athens to Rome May 21 &mdash; but CDC officials said there was less risk of infection during the shorter hops compared to the trans-Atlantic flights, which each lasted eight hours or more. It was while the man was in Rome that he learned further U.S. tests had determined his TB was the rare, extensively drug-resistant form, far more dangerous than he knew. They told him turn himself over to Italian health officials and not to fly on any commercial airlines. Instead, on May 24, the man flew from Rome to Prague on Czech Air Flight 0727, then flew to Montreal aboard Czech Air Flight 0104 and drove into the U.S., according to CDC officials. Officials are trying to contact people who sat within five rows of him on the two longest flights for testing. Other passengers are not considered at high risk of infection because tests indicated the amount of TB bacteria in the man was low, said Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine. The infected man told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that doctors initially did not order him not to fly and only suggested he put off his long-planned wedding. "We headed off to Greece thinking everything's fine," he told the newspaper. Dr. Charles Daley, head of the infectious disease division at National Jewish, said the hospital has treated two other patients with what appears to be the same strain of tuberculosis since 2000, although that strain had not been identified and named at the time. He said the patients had improved enough to be released. Associated Press writers Mike Stobbe, Greg Bluestein and Daniel Yee in Atlanta contributed to this report.
