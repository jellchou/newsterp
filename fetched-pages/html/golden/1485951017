Blair Choreographs End to a Stewardship Dogged by Iraq Then, Mr. Blair set off on what seemed a first stage of a lengthy and closely-scripted goodbye tour, even as Mr. Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, planned an equally busy campaign to persuade Britons of his suitability for the job of prime minister. As a first step to becoming prime minister, Mr. Brown announced his candidacy in the race for the Labor Party leadership, although it is doubtful that he will face serious opposition. Most Labor Party heavyweights who might have challenged Mr. Brown signaled their reluctance to do so in the weeks leading to Mr. Blair’s announcement on Thursday that he would step down on June 27. Two Labor left-wingers who said they would challenge Mr. Brown have failed to reach a deal on which of them should stand, apparently because of a lack of support among Labor lawmakers. Mr. Brown appeared before a crowd of cheering, youthful Labor Party supporters in central London to make his announcement today. “Today I announce that I’m a candidate to be leader of the Labor Party and to lead a new government,” he said. In a clear effort to distance himself from Mr. Blair, he promised greater government accountability, new procedures to allow parliament a voice in going to war and a greater stress on what he called “hearts and minds” alongside military efforts to combat terrorism and promote security. “Tony Blair has led our country for 10 years with distinction, with courage, with passion and with insight and in the weeks and months ahead my task is to show that I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people,” Mr. Brown said. “Today there are new priorities and I offer a new leadership for this new time.” Mr. Brown launched his campaign with a new slogan — “Gordon Brown for Britain” — and a personal manifesto that ranged from his views on society to his plans to visit British troops in Iraq. “Let me set out simply my core belief,” he said. “The Britain I believe in is a Britain of fairness and opportunity for all British citizens — every British citizen with every chance to make the most of themselves, every community fair to every citizen. If you work hard you are better off, if you save you are rewarded, if you play by the rules we will stand by you. “These are for me the best of British values: responsibilities required in return for rights, fairness not just for some but for all who earn it,” he said. “With the challenge of terrorism unlike anything that we have faced, the people of Britain want us strong in defense and security, succeeding not only militarily but also opening a new front, working with our allies to win the battle of hearts and minds at home and abroad,” he went on. He added: “Just as my first act as Chancellor of the Exchequer was to give away power to the Bank of England to restore trust in economic policy, so one of my first acts as Prime Minister would be to restore power to Parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy. Government must be more open and more accountable to Parliament — for example, in decisions about peace and war.” Mr. Brown continued: “In the next few weeks I will also visit our Armed Forces and the Middle East so we learn the lessons we have to learn from the last few years and we focus on the best ways to achieve lasting stability.” And he offered politics of conciliation without the star-dust that marked Mr. Blair’s early years. “I will form a government of all the talents, bringing people together, to listen, to learn and solve problems building on a broad sense of national purpose,” he said. “I do not believe politics is about celebrity,” he said. “When you put yourself forward for leadership, the country has a right to know where you come from, what you believe in and what you want to achieve. My father was a minister. For me, my parents were, and their inspiration still is, my moral compass. It’s a compass which has guided me through each stage of my life. They taught me the importance of integrity and decency, of treating people fairly and of duty to others.” “I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place, where I will always strive to be -- and that’s on people’s side,” he said. But Mr. Brown did not go into detail about foreign policy, particularly his view of the United States. Reluctant to be seen as a lame duck prime minister, Mr. Blair met at 10 Downing Street early today with Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president, who praised him at a brief news conference as a “great leader” — a markedly different assessment from that of many British adversaries who criticize his decision to join the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr. Blair also pledged to “still do everything I can” to work for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. Then he planned to visit outgoing President in Paris, according to British media reports. But during the news conference, he broke away from pondering European and Middle East issues to answer a question from a reporter who wanted to know whether he would support Mr. Brown as his successor. “I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labor Party and as Prime Minister and to endorse him fully,” Mr. Blair said. “He is an extraordinary and rare talent and it’s a tremendous thing if it’s put at the service of the nation as it now can be. He has shown, as perhaps the most successful Chancellor in our country’s history, that he’s got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great Prime Minister,” Mr. Blair said. “I know he’s absolutely determined to drive the modernization of the country forward in order to meet the challenges of the coming decade. I also believe that, as someone who has known him for over 20 years as a friend and a colleague, he can make a real difference to this country for the better and for the good,” he said. “I wish him well and, as I say, I’m delighted to support him and endorse him fully,” said Mr. Blair, choosing words Mr. Brown has reportedly been waiting to hear since the two men struck a leadership pact over dinner in 1994 — three years before Labor came to power.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Firefighters struggled early today to prevent a wildfire from reaching homes on the edge of Santa Catalina Island’s main town, as residents and visitors fled the resort island off the Southern California coast. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times A wildfire approached Santa Catalina Island&#146;s main city, Avalon, on Thursday. People wait to be evacuated from the town of Avalon, Calif., as smoke from a wildfire rises in the background on Santa Catalina Island. At least 160 firefighters, aided by four water-dropping helicopters and three retardant-dropping air tankers, battled flames through most of Thursday. The helicopters flew into the night and were back in the air at dawn today. Dozens of fire engines from as far away as Fresno arrived through the night aboard giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. The high-speed hovercraft can carry 60 tons of cargo over land or water, and are often used by the military on humanitarian missions. The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon on the island, which is more than 20 miles off the coast. Flames threatened the city limits of Avalon, where hundreds of people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries back to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas as ashes fell around them. A few homes on the island were burned, but firefighters worked to protect other properties late into the night, said Steven Hoefs, the chief of the Avalon fire department. Some 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. “We’re hanging in for now,” Chief Hoefs said. The blaze, which began five miles east of the island’s airport, grew to cover 4,000 acres, feeding on dry brush and scrub as winds steadily blew throughout the day and into the night on Thursday. Winds later calmed and the air grew more humid, although the threat of fire remained. An orange inferno loomed behind the quaint crescent-shaped harbor, the landmark 1929 Catalina Casino, and the homes, restaurants and tiny hotels clinging to slopes above the Avalon waterfront. A commercial building and several warehouses burned, and 175 utility customers lost electricity when power poles caught on fire. Overnight, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters were ferrying in firefighters, 32 at a time. Crews were being positioned at the city’s edge to protect homes. “We’re on defense mode for now,” Chief Hoefs said. In Avalon, authorities used a bullhorn to urge people to evacuate the city and head to the beach. Visitors to the island were directed to the historic Art Deco-style Casino building until it lost power, while residents were sent to another site along the harbor. The Catalina Express ferry service added several night departures of 400-passenger vessels from Avalon. Hundreds of residents and visitors boarded the ferries to reach the mainland. A family of eight said they had just enough time to pack some clothes and personal papers before fleeing. “I’m scared,” said Angelica Romero, 30, holding her 7-month-old daughter. “But what’s important is I have my children. The rest doesn’t matter.” At the mainland port of Long Beach, Kathy Troeger, a Santa Catalina resident, arrived by ferry with her three children and a friend’s daughter. Her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to help fight the blaze. “It was like a nightmare when we left,” she said. “You couldn’t breathe, and ash was falling like snow.” An evacuation center was set up at Cabrillo High School, where about 85 people had checked in, according to the Red Cross. Santa Catalina has been left parched by the same lack of rainfall that has made the Southern California mainland particularly susceptible to wildfires, like the one in Griffith Park in Los Angeles earlier this week. Firefighters were still working there today to surround what remained of the fire, which briefly chased people from adjacent homes and threatened the park’s landmark observatory and its zoo. Los Angeles officials had expected the Griffith Park fire to be fully contained by Thursday, two days after it peaked, and no visible flames remained, but fire crews were still building containment lines around the fire’s perimeter late into the night. Only 2 inches of rain have fallen on Santa Catalina since January. The island is long and fairly narrow, covering a total of 76 square miles of land area, most of it owned and kept as a preserve by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. various wildlife. The populated areas are served by helicopters and ferry boats from Los Angeles, Long Beach and other mainland harbors. Avalon, the main town, has a year-round population of 3,200, but swells to more than 10,000 on weekends and in the summer, according to the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/nyregion/11cnd-dix.html	6 Charged in Fort Dix Plot Held Without Bail - New York Times 6 Charged in Fort Dix Plot Held Without Bail Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 CAMDEN, N.J., May 11 — Six Muslim men from New Jersey and Philadelphia charged with plotting to attack Fort Dix with automatic weapons were ordered held without bail today by a federal magistrate here. The men were arrested on Monday night after a 15-month investigation in which the and two informers who had infiltrated the group taped them training with automatic weapons in rural Pennsylvania, conducting surveillance of military bases in the Northeast, watching videos of and the 9/11 hijackers and trying to buy AK-47 assault rifles. The authorities have described the suspects as Islamic extremists and have said they represent the newest breed of threat: loosely organized domestic militants unconnected to — but inspired by — or other international terror groups. Prosecutors argued today that the men, all of whom were born outside the United States, should be denied bail because they posed a flight risk. Only one of the men, Mohamad Shnewer, requested bail, with his family offering to put up four properties worth $580,000 and requesting that he be placed under house arrest with an electronic monitoring bracelet. An assistant United States attorney, Stephen R. Stigall, argued that house arrest offered no protection to the public because Mr. Shnewer “was living in that same house” as the plan to attack Fort Dix was being put together. United States Magistate Joel Schneider ordered that Mr. Shnewer, along with the five others, be held without bail. They have been held in a detention center in Philadelphia since their arrest. Five of the men — Mohamad Shnewer, 22; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir Duka, 23 — are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. The sixth man, Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons, an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. He will have a more detailed bail hearing later this week. After the hearing, Michael Huff, the attorney for Dritan Duka, said that defending terror suspects is challenging, “This is post-9/11,” he said, according to The Associated Press. “This is one of the No. 1 things on the public’s mind.” Troy Archie, the lawyer for the defendant Eljvir Duka, complained about the conditions under which his client is being held. Mr. Archie said that Mr. Duka “is basically just sitting in a cell in solitary” and that he had not been allowed to talk to his family. Mr. Archie also said that Mr. Duka’s request for a Koran had been ignored. The defense lawyer also raised questions about the confidential informer who prosecutors said was central to the case. “I just don’t understand how someone could infiltrate an alleged terrorist organization, and my emphasis is on allege , within 30 days of meeting them,” Mr. Archie said. He also questioned the informer’s background, which he said included a criminal record. “Everyone in the community knew him,” Mr. Archie said, “and he was bad news.” More Articles in New York Region &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Skip to next paragraph Doug Mills/The New York Times Representative Charles B. Rangel, above, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has led negotiations to complete the trade deals along with Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative. Trade Deficit Hits a Six-Month High The New York Times The unusual agreement, which came after weeks of negotiations, would guarantee workers the right to organize, ban child labor and prohibit forced labor in trading-partner countries. It would also require trading partners to enforce environmental laws already on their books and comply with several international environmental agreements. While the understanding was a victory for Democrats, it also represented a shrewd compromise by the White House. The agreement is the first major bipartisan economic deal to emerge since Democrats took control of Congress in January. It has immediate importance for four countries — — that are seeking to enter into trade pacts with the United States. But officials in Washington predicted that the agreement’s effect would go beyond those countries and could be a template for all trade deals, including a possible worldwide accord. Administration officials are hoping that the agreement will cause many Democrats to support future trade deals. They hope that enough Democrats will join with , who generally support such measures, to make passage of the agreements probable, if only narrowly. The negotiations were led on the administration side by Susan C. Schwab, the top trade envoy, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , and on the House side by Representative , Democrat of New York and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “I think today is a recognition of the results of the November election,” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. “It doesn’t mean that this paves the way for trade agreements where we have other obstacles. But where it comes down to labor standards and environment, this is enormous progress.” Ms. Schwab said that the agreement would send a message to trading partners that the United States was prepared to provide new impetus to the faltering talks for a global trade accord. Democrats have been pressing for worker, environmental and other protections on trade deals without success since President Bush took office in 2001. The absence of such protections has meant that when lawmakers passed measures that lowered trade barriers, they generally did so without the support of Democrats. In the 1990s, President was able to get only 40 percent of his fellow Democrats to endorse the North American Free Trade Agreement, and about 60 percent to support a global trade agreement. Since then, many Democrats have soured on measures to lower trade barriers. The breakthrough came as the politically sensitive trade deficit jumped in March to $63.9 billion, or 10 percent more than February’s revised deficit of $57.9 billion, putting the imbalance at its highest level in six months. The report, issued by the , followed a trend that economists have observed for months: even as growth slows in the United States, expanding economies abroad are creating a need for American exports. In March, exports totaled $126.2 billion, up $2.2 billion from February. Those gains were not enough to offset an $8.2 billion rise in imports, which totaled $190.1 billion. Thursday’s compromise affects four trade deals pending before Congress, two of them signed and two with negotiations that are nearly complete. All four countries would have to accept the provisions agreed to with the Democrats, but trade officials said they expected no major problems. Peru and Panama are considered most likely to win early Congressional approval. Colombia is more problematic, because Democrats are demanding that, besides the new measures, more protections be added to prevent violence against activists trying to organize workers. The South Korea accord, if put in place, would lead to the largest amount of increased trade. But it is opposed in its current version by Democrats who want greater access to that country’s markets for American beef, automobiles and auto parts. National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups hailed the understanding, but said they wanted to study its provisions before endorsing its details. Democrats have been most wary of two administration trade priorities: concluding the global negotiations known as the Doha round, named after the city in Qatar where the talks began six years ago; and extending Mr. Bush’s power to negotiate trade deals on which Congress gets only an up-or-down vote. This negotiating authority, known in Washington shorthand as fast track, has been vigorously opposed by Democrats, who say that they cannot imagine giving Mr. Bush open-ended negotiating authority. But Mr. Rangel said he could imagine a limited extension of such negotiating authority if the Doha round talks looked as if they were shaping up to be a good deal for the United States.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Firefighters struggled early today to prevent a wildfire from reaching homes on the edge of Santa Catalina Island’s main town, as residents and visitors fled the resort island off the Southern California coast. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times A wildfire approached Santa Catalina Island&#146;s main city, Avalon, on Thursday. People wait to be evacuated from the town of Avalon, Calif., as smoke from a wildfire rises in the background on Santa Catalina Island. At least 160 firefighters, aided by four water-dropping helicopters and three retardant-dropping air tankers, battled flames through most of Thursday. The helicopters flew into the night and were back in the air at dawn today. Dozens of fire engines from as far away as Fresno arrived through the night aboard giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. The high-speed hovercraft can carry 60 tons of cargo over land or water, and are often used by the military on humanitarian missions. The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon on the island, which is more than 20 miles off the coast. Flames threatened the city limits of Avalon, where hundreds of people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries back to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas as ashes fell around them. A few homes on the island were burned, but firefighters worked to protect other properties late into the night, said Steven Hoefs, the chief of the Avalon fire department. Some 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. “We’re hanging in for now,” Chief Hoefs said. The blaze, which began five miles east of the island’s airport, grew to cover 4,000 acres, feeding on dry brush and scrub as winds steadily blew throughout the day and into the night on Thursday. Winds later calmed and the air grew more humid, although the threat of fire remained. An orange inferno loomed behind the quaint crescent-shaped harbor, the landmark 1929 Catalina Casino, and the homes, restaurants and tiny hotels clinging to slopes above the Avalon waterfront. A commercial building and several warehouses burned, and 175 utility customers lost electricity when power poles caught on fire. Overnight, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters were ferrying in firefighters, 32 at a time. Crews were being positioned at the city’s edge to protect homes. “We’re on defense mode for now,” Chief Hoefs said. In Avalon, authorities used a bullhorn to urge people to evacuate the city and head to the beach. Visitors to the island were directed to the historic Art Deco-style Casino building until it lost power, while residents were sent to another site along the harbor. The Catalina Express ferry service added several night departures of 400-passenger vessels from Avalon. Hundreds of residents and visitors boarded the ferries to reach the mainland. A family of eight said they had just enough time to pack some clothes and personal papers before fleeing. “I’m scared,” said Angelica Romero, 30, holding her 7-month-old daughter. “But what’s important is I have my children. The rest doesn’t matter.” At the mainland port of Long Beach, Kathy Troeger, a Santa Catalina resident, arrived by ferry with her three children and a friend’s daughter. Her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to help fight the blaze. “It was like a nightmare when we left,” she said. “You couldn’t breathe, and ash was falling like snow.” An evacuation center was set up at Cabrillo High School, where about 85 people had checked in, according to the Red Cross. Santa Catalina has been left parched by the same lack of rainfall that has made the Southern California mainland particularly susceptible to wildfires, like the one in Griffith Park in Los Angeles earlier this week. Firefighters were still working there today to surround what remained of the fire, which briefly chased people from adjacent homes and threatened the park’s landmark observatory and its zoo. Los Angeles officials had expected the Griffith Park fire to be fully contained by Thursday, two days after it peaked, and no visible flames remained, but fire crews were still building containment lines around the fire’s perimeter late into the night. Only 2 inches of rain have fallen on Santa Catalina since January. The island is long and fairly narrow, covering a total of 76 square miles of land area, most of it owned and kept as a preserve by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. various wildlife. The populated areas are served by helicopters and ferry boats from Los Angeles, Long Beach and other mainland harbors. Avalon, the main town, has a year-round population of 3,200, but swells to more than 10,000 on weekends and in the summer, according to the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/washington/11cong.html	President Open to Benchmarks in Iraq Measure - New York Times President Open to Benchmarks in Iraq Measure Stephen Crowley/The New York Times President Bush, who visited the Pentagon, said he would agree to setting firm goals for the Iraqi government in the spending bill that is being debated in Congress. Though he had agreed to benchmarks before, Mr. Bush was unwilling to link them to financing or troop withdrawal. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 10 — Hours before the House approved a plan on Thursday to finance the war only through midsummer, President Bush offered his first public concession to try to resolve the impasse on war spending, acknowledging rising pressure from his own party and the public. After a briefing at the Pentagon, Mr. Bush said he had instructed , the White House chief of staff, to reach “common ground” with lawmakers of both parties over setting firm goals, or benchmarks, to measure progress in Iraq. Mr. Bush had previously insisted that he wanted about $95 billion for the military with no strings attached. “It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward,” Mr. Bush said, even as he threatened to veto the House plan, approved on a 221-to-205 vote Thursday night, which would require him to seek approval in two months for the balance of the war money. Still, Congressional leaders say the plan may never reach his desk, because the Senate is likely to take a different approach. Before the vote on Thursday, House Democrats demonstrated their opposition to continuing the war when 169 of them voted for a separate plan that would have required the withdrawal of American troops to begin in 90 days, with most forces out within another six months. joined in that effort, which failed by a 255-to-171 vote. Still, the plan attracted more support than anticipated. Speaker was among those voting in favor of it. Fifty-nine Democrats, including Representative of Maryland, the majority leader, opposed the proposal along with 196 Republicans. “We finally got to vote for what we believed in,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and a sponsor of the withdrawal plan. The bill approved by the House would provide $42.8 billion total, with about $30 billion directed to the war effort for the next two months. It requires the president to report by July 13 on how the Iraqi government is performing in building its military and moving toward achieving political unity. Congress would then vote a second time on whether to give the administration the remainder of the money — about $50 billion — to maintain operations in Iraq through Sept. 30 or to restrict that money to deployment. “No more,” said Mr. Hoyer, who backed the plan. “No more blank checks.” Republicans derided the Democratic approach as war on the installment plan, and they and Mr. Bush said the two-stage financing was unworkable. Once the Senate is through with its negotiations, lawmakers say, a final measure may be ready for the White House by the end of the month. Mr. Bush, who on Tuesday received a blunt assessment from Republican moderates about rising voter unrest over Iraq, acknowledged the public’s impatience with the war. But he said he could not allow political considerations like “the latest opinion poll, or how we can get our members elected” to drive his thinking. “My message to the members of Congress is, whatever your beliefs may be, let’s make sure our troops get funded, and let’s make sure politicians don’t tell our commanders how to conduct operations,” Mr. Bush said. Though Republicans voted solidly with the president, many made it clear that the administration had until September — the deadline for a progress report from Gen. , the commander in Iraq — to prove its war strategy was working. While it was Republican moderates who took their complaints directly to the president this week, others in the party expressed similar misgivings on Thursday. “There is a significant undercurrent that is looking for a reasonable way forward in Iraq,” said Representative Jeff Fortenberry, a conservative Republican of Nebraska, adding that the war is a leading concern for his constituents. “People are very conflicted in their hearts.” Several Republicans are considering bipartisan legislation aimed at changing the war’s course. Senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and of Tennessee have introduced separate proposals aimed at bringing a gradual end to the war. “We are troubled by the current policy,” Ms. Snowe said Thursday. “The White House needs to hear it.” While the White House has not opposed setting general goals for progress in Iraq, they have resisted any effort to tie financing or troop withdrawal plans to the benchmarks. On Thursday, Democrats welcomed the president’s new willingness to authorize negotiations on benchmarks but said any failure by Iraq to meet specified goals must result in penalties or they would be meaningless. “There is a recognition that things are not going well,” said Senator , Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader. “The only person who doesn’t believe there needs to be a change is the president.” The Senate hopes to consider its version of the war spending measure sometime next week, and Democrats have not made public many of their ideas. Lawmakers and senior administration officials say the most likely course is that the Senate would approve a new measure dropping the withdrawal date Mr. Bush objected to in vetoing the initial legislation but retaining other restrictions, while providing the president the ability to waive them. The White House has not been receptive in the past to proposals for such waivers. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior White House official disputed the notion that Mr. Bush’s agreement to consider signing a bill with specific benchmarks for the Iraqis to meet was tied to Republican complaints that more pressure be brought to bear on the Iraqi government to make faster progress toward political reconciliation. “We’ve said all along there’s going to be a compromise,” he said. The official said the president understood that if General Petraeus delivered a bad assessment of conditions in Iraq in September, it would make it hard for some Republicans to continue supporting the war. For all of the administration’s complaints about the Democratic approach, officials concede that the lawmakers’ efforts to impose a timetable for American withdrawal may at least have helped emphasize the president’s point to the Prime Minister that American patience is wearing thin and Iraq needs to act more urgently toward political reconciliation. Some White House officials privately expressed displeasure Thursday that the concerns the Republican moderates raised with the president became public. Vice President did not mince words in an interview with the Fox News Channel. “We didn’t get elected to be popular,” Mr. Cheney said. “We didn’t get elected to worry just about the fate of the Republican Party.” Some lawmakers said they had lost patience not only with the war in Iraq, but also with the continuing legislative and political conflict in Congress as the two parties maneuver over the war. “The Republicans should not be saying the Democrats don’t support the troops, nor should the Democrats be calling Republicans warmongers,” said Representative Jo Ann Emerson, Republican of Missouri and one of the 11 moderates who met with Mr. Bush on Tuesday. “Politics have taken over, and our soldiers deserve better.” Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

The men were arrested on Monday night after a 15-month investigation in which the and two informers who had infiltrated the group taped them training with automatic weapons in rural Pennsylvania, conducting surveillance of military bases in the Northeast, watching videos of and the 9/11 hijackers and trying to buy AK-47 assault rifles. The authorities have described the suspects as Islamic extremists and have said they represent the newest breed of threat: loosely organized domestic militants unconnected to — but inspired by — or other international terror groups. Prosecutors argued today that the men, all of whom were born outside the United States, should be denied bail because they posed a flight risk. Only one of the men, Mohamad Shnewer, requested bail, with his family offering to put up four properties worth $580,000 and requesting that he be placed under house arrest with an electronic monitoring bracelet. An assistant United States attorney, Stephen R. Stigall, argued that house arrest offered no protection to the public because Mr. Shnewer “was living in that same house” as the plan to attack Fort Dix was being put together. United States Magistate Joel Schneider ordered that Mr. Shnewer, along with the five others, be held without bail. They have been held in a detention center in Philadelphia since their arrest. Five of the men — Mohamad Shnewer, 22; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir Duka, 23 — are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. The sixth man, Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons, an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. He will have a more detailed bail hearing later this week. After the hearing, Michael Huff, the attorney for Dritan Duka, said that defending terror suspects is challenging, “This is post-9/11,” he said, according to The Associated Press. “This is one of the No. 1 things on the public’s mind.” Troy Archie, the lawyer for the defendant Eljvir Duka, complained about the conditions under which his client is being held. Mr. Archie said that Mr. Duka “is basically just sitting in a cell in solitary” and that he had not been allowed to talk to his family. Mr. Archie also said that Mr. Duka’s request for a Koran had been ignored. The defense lawyer also raised questions about the confidential informer who prosecutors said was central to the case. “I just don’t understand how someone could infiltrate an alleged terrorist organization, and my emphasis is on allege , within 30 days of meeting them,” Mr. Archie said. He also questioned the informer’s background, which he said included a criminal record. “Everyone in the community knew him,” Mr. Archie said, “and he was bad news.” More Articles in New York Region &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Stennis aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf today. Back Story With The Times's David Sanger ( Little of what Mr. Cheney said in the cavernous hangar bay of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. John C. Stennis, one of two carriers whose strike groups are now in the Persian Gulf, was new. Each individual line had, in some form, been said before, at various points in the four-year-long nuclear standoff with Iran, and during the increasingly tense arguments over whether Iran is aiding the insurgents in Iraq. But Mr. Cheney stitched all of those warnings together, and the symbolism of sending the administration’s most famous hawk to deliver the speech so close to Iran’s coast was unmistakable. It also came just a week after Secretary of State talked briefly and inconclusively with Iran’s foreign minister, a step toward re-engagement with Iran that some in the administration have opposed. Mr. Cheney’s sharp warnings appeared to be part of a two-track administration campaign to push back at Iran, while leaving the door open to negotiations. It was almost exactly a year ago that the United States offered to negotiate with Iran as long as it first agreed to halt enriching uranium, a decision in which Mr. Cheney, participants said, was not a major player. Similarly, the speech today was not circulated broadly in the government before it was delivered, a senior American diplomat said. “He kind of runs by his own rules,” the official said. When President Bush ordered the two carriers into the Gulf late last year, senior administration officials said it was part of an effort to gain some negotiating leverage over the Iranians. At about the same time, American military personnel began capturing some Iranians in Iraq, and some of them are still held there. American officials have also been pressing Europeans banks and companies to avoid doing business with Tehran, in an effort to make it more difficult for the country to recycle its oil profits. Oil seemed to be on Mr. Cheney’s mind today, when he told an audience of 3,500 to 4,000 American service members on the Stennis that Iran would not be permitted to choke off oil shipments through the waters of the region. “With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we’re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike,” he said. “We’ll keep the sea lanes open. We’ll stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats. We’ll disrupt attacks on our own forces. We’ll continue bringing relief to those who suffer, and delivering justice to the enemies of freedom. And we’ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Some experts on Iran have questioned whether the threats that administration officials occasionally deliver to Iran aid or undercut the diplomacy with the country. “The problem with the two-track policy is that the first track — coercion, sanctions, naval deployments — can undercut the results on the second track,” said Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar at the Council of Foreign Relations and the author of “Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic” (Henry Holt, 2006). “There are some in Tehran who will look at Cheney on that carrier and say that everything Rice is offering is not real. What’s real, to their mind, are the coercive policies Cheney is describing. “This is a case where we are trying to get through negotiations what, so far, we couldn’t get through coercion.” The symbols of coercion were part of the backdrop on the Stennis: Mr. Cheney spoke in front of five F-18 Super Hornet warplanes. But mindful of the lasting imagery of President Bush on another carrier a little more than four years ago, there were no signs proclaiming success, much less “Mission Accomplished.” Instead, Mr. Cheney repeated his arguments about the danger of early withdrawal from Iraq. “I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat,” Mr. Cheney said. “We want to complete the mission, we want to get it done right, and then we want to return home with honor.” Mr. Cheney is on a weeklong visit to the Middle East, and made Iraq his first stop on Wednesday and Thursday. He spoke to American troops stationed near ’s birthplace, Tikrit, telling them in somber tones that they still had a tough fight ahead of them. His assessment stood in stark contrast to the one he made two years ago, when he declared in an interview with CNN that the insurgency in Iraq was in its “last throes.” The United States remains at odds with Iran over its uranium-enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful nuclear energy, but which America and its Western allies say is intended instead to produce atomic weapons. Administration officials have also said that weapons are being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and that insurgents may be getting training in bomb-making and bomb-placing techniques in Iran. The Iranian government denies sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. Mr. Cheney visited the U.S.S. John C. Stennis before, in March 2002, at a time when he was trying to build support for the invasion of Iraq. He also visited Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where the president of Iran, , is expected to arrive in the next few days. Mr. Cheney’s tour is also scheduled to include visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting for this article from Baghdad, and Graham Bowley contributed from New York.

Skip to next paragraph Doug Mills/The New York Times Representative Charles B. Rangel, above, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has led negotiations to complete the trade deals along with Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative. Trade Deficit Hits a Six-Month High The New York Times The unusual agreement, which came after weeks of negotiations, would guarantee workers the right to organize, ban child labor and prohibit forced labor in trading-partner countries. It would also require trading partners to enforce environmental laws already on their books and comply with several international environmental agreements. While the understanding was a victory for Democrats, it also represented a shrewd compromise by the White House. The agreement is the first major bipartisan economic deal to emerge since Democrats took control of Congress in January. It has immediate importance for four countries — — that are seeking to enter into trade pacts with the United States. But officials in Washington predicted that the agreement’s effect would go beyond those countries and could be a template for all trade deals, including a possible worldwide accord. Administration officials are hoping that the agreement will cause many Democrats to support future trade deals. They hope that enough Democrats will join with , who generally support such measures, to make passage of the agreements probable, if only narrowly. The negotiations were led on the administration side by Susan C. Schwab, the top trade envoy, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , and on the House side by Representative , Democrat of New York and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “I think today is a recognition of the results of the November election,” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. “It doesn’t mean that this paves the way for trade agreements where we have other obstacles. But where it comes down to labor standards and environment, this is enormous progress.” Ms. Schwab said that the agreement would send a message to trading partners that the United States was prepared to provide new impetus to the faltering talks for a global trade accord. Democrats have been pressing for worker, environmental and other protections on trade deals without success since President Bush took office in 2001. The absence of such protections has meant that when lawmakers passed measures that lowered trade barriers, they generally did so without the support of Democrats. In the 1990s, President was able to get only 40 percent of his fellow Democrats to endorse the North American Free Trade Agreement, and about 60 percent to support a global trade agreement. Since then, many Democrats have soured on measures to lower trade barriers. The breakthrough came as the politically sensitive trade deficit jumped in March to $63.9 billion, or 10 percent more than February’s revised deficit of $57.9 billion, putting the imbalance at its highest level in six months. The report, issued by the , followed a trend that economists have observed for months: even as growth slows in the United States, expanding economies abroad are creating a need for American exports. In March, exports totaled $126.2 billion, up $2.2 billion from February. Those gains were not enough to offset an $8.2 billion rise in imports, which totaled $190.1 billion. Thursday’s compromise affects four trade deals pending before Congress, two of them signed and two with negotiations that are nearly complete. All four countries would have to accept the provisions agreed to with the Democrats, but trade officials said they expected no major problems. Peru and Panama are considered most likely to win early Congressional approval. Colombia is more problematic, because Democrats are demanding that, besides the new measures, more protections be added to prevent violence against activists trying to organize workers. The South Korea accord, if put in place, would lead to the largest amount of increased trade. But it is opposed in its current version by Democrats who want greater access to that country’s markets for American beef, automobiles and auto parts. National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups hailed the understanding, but said they wanted to study its provisions before endorsing its details. Democrats have been most wary of two administration trade priorities: concluding the global negotiations known as the Doha round, named after the city in Qatar where the talks began six years ago; and extending Mr. Bush’s power to negotiate trade deals on which Congress gets only an up-or-down vote. This negotiating authority, known in Washington shorthand as fast track, has been vigorously opposed by Democrats, who say that they cannot imagine giving Mr. Bush open-ended negotiating authority. But Mr. Rangel said he could imagine a limited extension of such negotiating authority if the Doha round talks looked as if they were shaping up to be a good deal for the United States.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/middleeast/11cnd-cheney.html	On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran - New York Times On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 BRUSSELS, May 11 — Vice President used the deck of an American aircraft carrier just 150 miles off ’s coast as the backdrop today to warn the country that the United States was prepared to use its naval power to keep Tehran from disrupting off oil routes or “gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Skip to next paragraph Vice President Dick Cheney on board the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf today. Back Story With The Times's David Sanger ( Little of what Mr. Cheney said in the cavernous hangar bay of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. John C. Stennis, one of two carriers whose strike groups are now in the Persian Gulf, was new. Each individual line had, in some form, been said before, at various points in the four-year-long nuclear standoff with Iran, and during the increasingly tense arguments over whether Iran is aiding the insurgents in Iraq. But Mr. Cheney stitched all of those warnings together, and the symbolism of sending the administration’s most famous hawk to deliver the speech so close to Iran’s coast was unmistakable. It also came just a week after Secretary of State talked briefly and inconclusively with Iran’s foreign minister, a step toward re-engagement with Iran that some in the administration have opposed. Mr. Cheney’s sharp warnings appeared to be part of a two-track administration campaign to push back at Iran, while leaving the door open to negotiations. It was almost exactly a year ago that the United States offered to negotiate with Iran as long as it first agreed to halt enriching uranium, a decision in which Mr. Cheney, participants said, was not a major player. Similarly, the speech today was not circulated broadly in the government before it was delivered, a senior American diplomat said. “He kind of runs by his own rules,” the official said. When President Bush ordered the two carriers into the Gulf late last year, senior administration officials said it was part of an effort to gain some negotiating leverage over the Iranians. At about the same time, American military personnel began capturing some Iranians in Iraq, and some of them are still held there. American officials have also been pressing Europeans banks and companies to avoid doing business with Tehran, in an effort to make it more difficult for the country to recycle its oil profits. Oil seemed to be on Mr. Cheney’s mind today, when he told an audience of 3,500 to 4,000 American service members on the Stennis that Iran would not be permitted to choke off oil shipments through the waters of the region. “With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we’re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike,” he said. “We’ll keep the sea lanes open. We’ll stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats. We’ll disrupt attacks on our own forces. We’ll continue bringing relief to those who suffer, and delivering justice to the enemies of freedom. And we’ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Some experts on Iran have questioned whether the threats that administration officials occasionally deliver to Iran aid or undercut the diplomacy with the country. “The problem with the two-track policy is that the first track — coercion, sanctions, naval deployments — can undercut the results on the second track,” said Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar at the Council of Foreign Relations and the author of “Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic” (Henry Holt, 2006). “There are some in Tehran who will look at Cheney on that carrier and say that everything Rice is offering is not real. What’s real, to their mind, are the coercive policies Cheney is describing. “This is a case where we are trying to get through negotiations what, so far, we couldn’t get through coercion.” The symbols of coercion were part of the backdrop on the Stennis: Mr. Cheney spoke in front of five F-18 Super Hornet warplanes. But mindful of the lasting imagery of President Bush on another carrier a little more than four years ago, there were no signs proclaiming success, much less “Mission Accomplished.” Instead, Mr. Cheney repeated his arguments about the danger of early withdrawal from Iraq. “I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat,” Mr. Cheney said. “We want to complete the mission, we want to get it done right, and then we want to return home with honor.” Mr. Cheney is on a weeklong visit to the Middle East, and made Iraq his first stop on Wednesday and Thursday. He spoke to American troops stationed near ’s birthplace, Tikrit, telling them in somber tones that they still had a tough fight ahead of them. His assessment stood in stark contrast to the one he made two years ago, when he declared in an interview with CNN that the insurgency in Iraq was in its “last throes.” The United States remains at odds with Iran over its uranium-enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful nuclear energy, but which America and its Western allies say is intended instead to produce atomic weapons. Administration officials have also said that weapons are being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and that insurgents may be getting training in bomb-making and bomb-placing techniques in Iran. The Iranian government denies sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. Mr. Cheney visited the U.S.S. John C. Stennis before, in March 2002, at a time when he was trying to build support for the invasion of Iraq. He also visited Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where the president of Iran, , is expected to arrive in the next few days. Mr. Cheney’s tour is also scheduled to include visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting for this article from Baghdad, and Graham Bowley contributed from New York.

Though he had agreed to benchmarks before, Mr. Bush was unwilling to link them to financing or troop withdrawal. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 10 — Hours before the House approved a plan on Thursday to finance the war only through midsummer, President Bush offered his first public concession to try to resolve the impasse on war spending, acknowledging rising pressure from his own party and the public. After a briefing at the Pentagon, Mr. Bush said he had instructed , the White House chief of staff, to reach “common ground” with lawmakers of both parties over setting firm goals, or benchmarks, to measure progress in Iraq. Mr. Bush had previously insisted that he wanted about $95 billion for the military with no strings attached. “It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward,” Mr. Bush said, even as he threatened to veto the House plan, approved on a 221-to-205 vote Thursday night, which would require him to seek approval in two months for the balance of the war money. Still, Congressional leaders say the plan may never reach his desk, because the Senate is likely to take a different approach. Before the vote on Thursday, House Democrats demonstrated their opposition to continuing the war when 169 of them voted for a separate plan that would have required the withdrawal of American troops to begin in 90 days, with most forces out within another six months. joined in that effort, which failed by a 255-to-171 vote. Still, the plan attracted more support than anticipated. Speaker was among those voting in favor of it. Fifty-nine Democrats, including Representative of Maryland, the majority leader, opposed the proposal along with 196 Republicans. “We finally got to vote for what we believed in,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and a sponsor of the withdrawal plan. The bill approved by the House would provide $42.8 billion total, with about $30 billion directed to the war effort for the next two months. It requires the president to report by July 13 on how the Iraqi government is performing in building its military and moving toward achieving political unity. Congress would then vote a second time on whether to give the administration the remainder of the money — about $50 billion — to maintain operations in Iraq through Sept. 30 or to restrict that money to deployment. “No more,” said Mr. Hoyer, who backed the plan. “No more blank checks.” Republicans derided the Democratic approach as war on the installment plan, and they and Mr. Bush said the two-stage financing was unworkable. Once the Senate is through with its negotiations, lawmakers say, a final measure may be ready for the White House by the end of the month. Mr. Bush, who on Tuesday received a blunt assessment from Republican moderates about rising voter unrest over Iraq, acknowledged the public’s impatience with the war. But he said he could not allow political considerations like “the latest opinion poll, or how we can get our members elected” to drive his thinking. “My message to the members of Congress is, whatever your beliefs may be, let’s make sure our troops get funded, and let’s make sure politicians don’t tell our commanders how to conduct operations,” Mr. Bush said. Though Republicans voted solidly with the president, many made it clear that the administration had until September — the deadline for a progress report from Gen. , the commander in Iraq — to prove its war strategy was working. While it was Republican moderates who took their complaints directly to the president this week, others in the party expressed similar misgivings on Thursday. “There is a significant undercurrent that is looking for a reasonable way forward in Iraq,” said Representative Jeff Fortenberry, a conservative Republican of Nebraska, adding that the war is a leading concern for his constituents. “People are very conflicted in their hearts.” Several Republicans are considering bipartisan legislation aimed at changing the war’s course. Senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and of Tennessee have introduced separate proposals aimed at bringing a gradual end to the war. “We are troubled by the current policy,” Ms. Snowe said Thursday. “The White House needs to hear it.” While the White House has not opposed setting general goals for progress in Iraq, they have resisted any effort to tie financing or troop withdrawal plans to the benchmarks. On Thursday, Democrats welcomed the president’s new willingness to authorize negotiations on benchmarks but said any failure by Iraq to meet specified goals must result in penalties or they would be meaningless. “There is a recognition that things are not going well,” said Senator , Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader. “The only person who doesn’t believe there needs to be a change is the president.” The Senate hopes to consider its version of the war spending measure sometime next week, and Democrats have not made public many of their ideas. Lawmakers and senior administration officials say the most likely course is that the Senate would approve a new measure dropping the withdrawal date Mr. Bush objected to in vetoing the initial legislation but retaining other restrictions, while providing the president the ability to waive them. The White House has not been receptive in the past to proposals for such waivers. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior White House official disputed the notion that Mr. Bush’s agreement to consider signing a bill with specific benchmarks for the Iraqis to meet was tied to Republican complaints that more pressure be brought to bear on the Iraqi government to make faster progress toward political reconciliation. “We’ve said all along there’s going to be a compromise,” he said. The official said the president understood that if General Petraeus delivered a bad assessment of conditions in Iraq in September, it would make it hard for some Republicans to continue supporting the war. For all of the administration’s complaints about the Democratic approach, officials concede that the lawmakers’ efforts to impose a timetable for American withdrawal may at least have helped emphasize the president’s point to the Prime Minister that American patience is wearing thin and Iraq needs to act more urgently toward political reconciliation. Some White House officials privately expressed displeasure Thursday that the concerns the Republican moderates raised with the president became public. Vice President did not mince words in an interview with the Fox News Channel. “We didn’t get elected to be popular,” Mr. Cheney said. “We didn’t get elected to worry just about the fate of the Republican Party.” Some lawmakers said they had lost patience not only with the war in Iraq, but also with the continuing legislative and political conflict in Congress as the two parties maneuver over the war. “The Republicans should not be saying the Democrats don’t support the troops, nor should the Democrats be calling Republicans warmongers,” said Representative Jo Ann Emerson, Republican of Missouri and one of the 11 moderates who met with Mr. Bush on Tuesday. “Politics have taken over, and our soldiers deserve better.” Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/europe/11cnd-blair.html	Blair Endorses Gordon Brown as His Successor - New York Times Blair Endorses Gordon Brown as His Successor Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 LONDON, May 11 — A day after announcing that he would step down in June, Prime Minister offered a fulsome if long-delayed endorsement today of as his successor, calling him “an extraordinary and rare talent.” Skip to next paragraph Gordon Brown with his wife, Sarah, and his campaign manager, Jack Straw, left, launching his campaign for leadership of Britain's Labor Party today in London. Blair Choreographs End to a Stewardship Dogged by Iraq Then, Mr. Blair set off on what seemed a first stage of a lengthy and closely-scripted goodbye tour, even as Mr. Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, planned an equally busy campaign to persuade Britons of his suitability for the job of prime minister. As a first step to becoming prime minister, Mr. Brown announced his candidacy in the race for the Labor Party leadership, although it is doubtful that he will face serious opposition. Most Labor Party heavyweights who might have challenged Mr. Brown signaled their reluctance to do so in the weeks leading to Mr. Blair’s announcement on Thursday that he would step down on June 27. Two Labor left-wingers who said they would challenge Mr. Brown have failed to reach a deal on which of them should stand, apparently because of a lack of support among Labor lawmakers. Mr. Brown appeared before a crowd of cheering, youthful Labor Party supporters in central London to make his announcement today. “Today I announce that I’m a candidate to be leader of the Labor Party and to lead a new government,” he said. In a clear effort to distance himself from Mr. Blair, he promised greater government accountability, new procedures to allow parliament a voice in going to war and a greater stress on what he called “hearts and minds” alongside military efforts to combat terrorism and promote security. “Tony Blair has led our country for 10 years with distinction, with courage, with passion and with insight and in the weeks and months ahead my task is to show that I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people,” Mr. Brown said. “Today there are new priorities and I offer a new leadership for this new time.” Mr. Brown launched his campaign with a new slogan — “Gordon Brown for Britain” — and a personal manifesto that ranged from his views on society to his plans to visit British troops in Iraq. “Let me set out simply my core belief,” he said. “The Britain I believe in is a Britain of fairness and opportunity for all British citizens — every British citizen with every chance to make the most of themselves, every community fair to every citizen. If you work hard you are better off, if you save you are rewarded, if you play by the rules we will stand by you. “These are for me the best of British values: responsibilities required in return for rights, fairness not just for some but for all who earn it,” he said. “With the challenge of terrorism unlike anything that we have faced, the people of Britain want us strong in defense and security, succeeding not only militarily but also opening a new front, working with our allies to win the battle of hearts and minds at home and abroad,” he went on. He added: “Just as my first act as Chancellor of the Exchequer was to give away power to the Bank of England to restore trust in economic policy, so one of my first acts as Prime Minister would be to restore power to Parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy. Government must be more open and more accountable to Parliament — for example, in decisions about peace and war.” Mr. Brown continued: “In the next few weeks I will also visit our Armed Forces and the Middle East so we learn the lessons we have to learn from the last few years and we focus on the best ways to achieve lasting stability.” And he offered politics of conciliation without the star-dust that marked Mr. Blair’s early years. “I will form a government of all the talents, bringing people together, to listen, to learn and solve problems building on a broad sense of national purpose,” he said. “I do not believe politics is about celebrity,” he said. “When you put yourself forward for leadership, the country has a right to know where you come from, what you believe in and what you want to achieve. My father was a minister. For me, my parents were, and their inspiration still is, my moral compass. It’s a compass which has guided me through each stage of my life. They taught me the importance of integrity and decency, of treating people fairly and of duty to others.” “I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place, where I will always strive to be -- and that’s on people’s side,” he said. But Mr. Brown did not go into detail about foreign policy, particularly his view of the United States. Reluctant to be seen as a lame duck prime minister, Mr. Blair met at 10 Downing Street early today with Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president, who praised him at a brief news conference as a “great leader” — a markedly different assessment from that of many British adversaries who criticize his decision to join the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr. Blair also pledged to “still do everything I can” to work for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. Then he planned to visit outgoing President in Paris, according to British media reports. But during the news conference, he broke away from pondering European and Middle East issues to answer a question from a reporter who wanted to know whether he would support Mr. Brown as his successor. “I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labor Party and as Prime Minister and to endorse him fully,” Mr. Blair said. “He is an extraordinary and rare talent and it’s a tremendous thing if it’s put at the service of the nation as it now can be. He has shown, as perhaps the most successful Chancellor in our country’s history, that he’s got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great Prime Minister,” Mr. Blair said. “I know he’s absolutely determined to drive the modernization of the country forward in order to meet the challenges of the coming decade. I also believe that, as someone who has known him for over 20 years as a friend and a colleague, he can make a real difference to this country for the better and for the good,” he said. “I wish him well and, as I say, I’m delighted to support him and endorse him fully,” said Mr. Blair, choosing words Mr. Brown has reportedly been waiting to hear since the two men struck a leadership pact over dinner in 1994 — three years before Labor came to power.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Firefighters struggled early today to prevent a wildfire from reaching homes on the edge of Santa Catalina Island’s main town, as residents and visitors fled the resort island off the Southern California coast. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times A wildfire approached Santa Catalina Island&#146;s main city, Avalon, on Thursday. People wait to be evacuated from the town of Avalon, Calif., as smoke from a wildfire rises in the background on Santa Catalina Island. At least 160 firefighters, aided by four water-dropping helicopters and three retardant-dropping air tankers, battled flames through most of Thursday. The helicopters flew into the night and were back in the air at dawn today. Dozens of fire engines from as far away as Fresno arrived through the night aboard giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. The high-speed hovercraft can carry 60 tons of cargo over land or water, and are often used by the military on humanitarian missions. The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon on the island, which is more than 20 miles off the coast. Flames threatened the city limits of Avalon, where hundreds of people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries back to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas as ashes fell around them. A few homes on the island were burned, but firefighters worked to protect other properties late into the night, said Steven Hoefs, the chief of the Avalon fire department. Some 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. “We’re hanging in for now,” Chief Hoefs said. The blaze, which began five miles east of the island’s airport, grew to cover 4,000 acres, feeding on dry brush and scrub as winds steadily blew throughout the day and into the night on Thursday. Winds later calmed and the air grew more humid, although the threat of fire remained. An orange inferno loomed behind the quaint crescent-shaped harbor, the landmark 1929 Catalina Casino, and the homes, restaurants and tiny hotels clinging to slopes above the Avalon waterfront. A commercial building and several warehouses burned, and 175 utility customers lost electricity when power poles caught on fire. Overnight, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters were ferrying in firefighters, 32 at a time. Crews were being positioned at the city’s edge to protect homes. “We’re on defense mode for now,” Chief Hoefs said. In Avalon, authorities used a bullhorn to urge people to evacuate the city and head to the beach. Visitors to the island were directed to the historic Art Deco-style Casino building until it lost power, while residents were sent to another site along the harbor. The Catalina Express ferry service added several night departures of 400-passenger vessels from Avalon. Hundreds of residents and visitors boarded the ferries to reach the mainland. A family of eight said they had just enough time to pack some clothes and personal papers before fleeing. “I’m scared,” said Angelica Romero, 30, holding her 7-month-old daughter. “But what’s important is I have my children. The rest doesn’t matter.” At the mainland port of Long Beach, Kathy Troeger, a Santa Catalina resident, arrived by ferry with her three children and a friend’s daughter. Her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to help fight the blaze. “It was like a nightmare when we left,” she said. “You couldn’t breathe, and ash was falling like snow.” An evacuation center was set up at Cabrillo High School, where about 85 people had checked in, according to the Red Cross. Santa Catalina has been left parched by the same lack of rainfall that has made the Southern California mainland particularly susceptible to wildfires, like the one in Griffith Park in Los Angeles earlier this week. Firefighters were still working there today to surround what remained of the fire, which briefly chased people from adjacent homes and threatened the park’s landmark observatory and its zoo. Los Angeles officials had expected the Griffith Park fire to be fully contained by Thursday, two days after it peaked, and no visible flames remained, but fire crews were still building containment lines around the fire’s perimeter late into the night. Only 2 inches of rain have fallen on Santa Catalina since January. The island is long and fairly narrow, covering a total of 76 square miles of land area, most of it owned and kept as a preserve by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. various wildlife. The populated areas are served by helicopters and ferry boats from Los Angeles, Long Beach and other mainland harbors. Avalon, the main town, has a year-round population of 3,200, but swells to more than 10,000 on weekends and in the summer, according to the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau.

Tech Graduation A Virginia Tech student paying his respects at a memorial to the shooting victims before the start of commencement exercises. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 BLACKSBURG, Va., May 11 — Commencement at the was supposed to be a moment for parents to watch their children take a symbolic step. From a youthful safe haven, students would graduate into a larger and less predictable world. Skip to next paragraph Melanie Blanding for The New York Times A memorial to the victims of the shootings at Virginia Tech. But that harsh unpredictability came to the Virginia Tech campus in April with a deadly shooting rampage. And today, as thousands of parents arrived for graduation ceremonies, it was hard to tell the tears of joy from those of sadness. Students shared giddy hugs and tossed their tassels. In quieter moments, they also spoke of feelings of guilt and the uncomfortable celebrity of having survived. Faculty members regaled proud parents with classroom anecdotes. They also said they still struggled to find the right words to capture the conflicting mix of emotions. “This is supposed to be a celebration,” said Bryan Cloyd, who is both a parent of one the slain students and a professor on campus. Mr. Cloyd carried a distinct trepidation into the ceremonies, but overcame an initial reluctance to join the festivities. He will receive an honorary degree for his 18-year-old daughter, Austin, in hopes of helping remove the “emotional cloud” still looming over campus, he said. “We’re also looking for any healing we can get,” he added. Caroline Merrey, a senior, said she hoped that graduation and the promise of summer would lessen her haunting sense of guilt. “There are lots of days when I think I should have gone back and done something,” said Ms. Merrey, who leapt from a classroom window while her professor, , blocked the door, temporarily keeping the gunman at bay. “I’m lucky that I didn’t get shot and I’m still here. But I feel like what I did was a cheap way out.” Professor Librescu died of gunshot wounds. Ms. Merry said she plans to move in the coming weeks to Chicago, where some of her relatives live, and to start looking there for a job in engineering. Distance and a recent haircut may help restore an anonymity and normalcy that was removed by the shootings, she added. “Graduation is hard enough, because you don’t know what happens next,” she said. “It’s even harder with these emotions, all the media, and the reminders everywhere of what happened.” Karan Grewal, a former suitemate of the gunman, , said his mind drifts to questions he would rather avoid. “I think about why he didn’t start with us back at the suite, and why he went to the other dorm instead,” Mr. Grewal said. “But my philosophy has been that if I let those thoughts take over, then Cho won. So, I focus on enjoying graduation and moving forward.” Looking toward Saturday, when individual departments will hold their own ceremonies, Nikki Giovanni, a poet and English Department professor, said it was a difficult time to be a public speaker. “You have this elephant in the room, and you don’t know how to tame it,” said Ms. Giovanni, who was asked by others on the faculty to speak at her departmental ceremony. “You can’t dwell on what happened, but you can’t overlook it either.” Still, she said, her job was easier than others. She would not need to write much new material, because her department asked her to deliver her poem, “We are Virginia Tech,” again. She presented that poem during a convocation in the days after the shooting, and it became an emotional turning point during that ceremony, bringing a somber crowd to its feet in clapping and chanting. Saturday’s commencement address will be the last time she reads the poem publicly, she said, because she does not want it to become the defining voice of the tragedy. More than with sorrow, Dr. Ishwar K. Puri said he finished the year with an overwhelming sense of awe at the generosity of strangers. Dr. Puri, the chairman of the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, said that when the police sealed off Norris Hall, the site of most of the shooting, as a crime scene, his 24 faculty members, 80 doctoral students and 25 master’s students were left blocked from their laboratories. Their research ground to a halt; so did their ability to apply for jobs or for research grants. But offers to help began arriving almost immediately, he said. The Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands invited his whole faculty to work in its laboratories on paid sabbaticals. Dell, the computer manufacturer, donated 30 laptop and 20 desktop computers to replace those left stranded in the inaccessible laboratories. University opened their laboratories for internships. “Really, this has turned into a story of hope, not despair,” he said. He added, however, that as he looked toward the summer, he had to admit there was a small sense of dread, too. As the spirit of Hokie pride subsides on campus with the departure of students and faculty, Dr. Puri said he was not looking forward to facing a painful task he has put off for weeks: the writing of a job announcement to seek replacements for the two professors in his department who were killed. “Doing that strikes you with the finality of it all,” he said. “How, really, do you replace people who were colleagues, friends, individuals? You can’t.” More Articles in National &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Blair Choreographs End to a Stewardship Dogged by Iraq Then, Mr. Blair set off on what seemed a first stage of a lengthy and closely-scripted goodbye tour, even as Mr. Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, planned an equally busy campaign to persuade Britons of his suitability for the job of prime minister. As a first step to becoming prime minister, Mr. Brown announced his candidacy in the race for the Labor Party leadership, although it is doubtful that he will face serious opposition. Most Labor Party heavyweights who might have challenged Mr. Brown signaled their reluctance to do so in the weeks leading to Mr. Blair’s announcement on Thursday that he would step down on June 27. Two Labor left-wingers who said they would challenge Mr. Brown have failed to reach a deal on which of them should stand, apparently because of a lack of support among Labor lawmakers. Mr. Brown appeared before a crowd of cheering, youthful Labor Party supporters in central London to make his announcement today. “Today I announce that I’m a candidate to be leader of the Labor Party and to lead a new government,” he said. In a clear effort to distance himself from Mr. Blair, he promised greater government accountability, new procedures to allow parliament a voice in going to war and a greater stress on what he called “hearts and minds” alongside military efforts to combat terrorism and promote security. “Tony Blair has led our country for 10 years with distinction, with courage, with passion and with insight and in the weeks and months ahead my task is to show that I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people,” Mr. Brown said. “Today there are new priorities and I offer a new leadership for this new time.” Mr. Brown launched his campaign with a new slogan — “Gordon Brown for Britain” — and a personal manifesto that ranged from his views on society to his plans to visit British troops in Iraq. “Let me set out simply my core belief,” he said. “The Britain I believe in is a Britain of fairness and opportunity for all British citizens — every British citizen with every chance to make the most of themselves, every community fair to every citizen. If you work hard you are better off, if you save you are rewarded, if you play by the rules we will stand by you. “These are for me the best of British values: responsibilities required in return for rights, fairness not just for some but for all who earn it,” he said. “With the challenge of terrorism unlike anything that we have faced, the people of Britain want us strong in defense and security, succeeding not only militarily but also opening a new front, working with our allies to win the battle of hearts and minds at home and abroad,” he went on. He added: “Just as my first act as Chancellor of the Exchequer was to give away power to the Bank of England to restore trust in economic policy, so one of my first acts as Prime Minister would be to restore power to Parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy. Government must be more open and more accountable to Parliament — for example, in decisions about peace and war.” Mr. Brown continued: “In the next few weeks I will also visit our Armed Forces and the Middle East so we learn the lessons we have to learn from the last few years and we focus on the best ways to achieve lasting stability.” And he offered politics of conciliation without the star-dust that marked Mr. Blair’s early years. “I will form a government of all the talents, bringing people together, to listen, to learn and solve problems building on a broad sense of national purpose,” he said. “I do not believe politics is about celebrity,” he said. “When you put yourself forward for leadership, the country has a right to know where you come from, what you believe in and what you want to achieve. My father was a minister. For me, my parents were, and their inspiration still is, my moral compass. It’s a compass which has guided me through each stage of my life. They taught me the importance of integrity and decency, of treating people fairly and of duty to others.” “I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place, where I will always strive to be -- and that’s on people’s side,” he said. But Mr. Brown did not go into detail about foreign policy, particularly his view of the United States. Reluctant to be seen as a lame duck prime minister, Mr. Blair met at 10 Downing Street early today with Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president, who praised him at a brief news conference as a “great leader” — a markedly different assessment from that of many British adversaries who criticize his decision to join the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr. Blair also pledged to “still do everything I can” to work for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. Then he planned to visit outgoing President in Paris, according to British media reports. But during the news conference, he broke away from pondering European and Middle East issues to answer a question from a reporter who wanted to know whether he would support Mr. Brown as his successor. “I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labor Party and as Prime Minister and to endorse him fully,” Mr. Blair said. “He is an extraordinary and rare talent and it’s a tremendous thing if it’s put at the service of the nation as it now can be. He has shown, as perhaps the most successful Chancellor in our country’s history, that he’s got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great Prime Minister,” Mr. Blair said. “I know he’s absolutely determined to drive the modernization of the country forward in order to meet the challenges of the coming decade. I also believe that, as someone who has known him for over 20 years as a friend and a colleague, he can make a real difference to this country for the better and for the good,” he said. “I wish him well and, as I say, I’m delighted to support him and endorse him fully,” said Mr. Blair, choosing words Mr. Brown has reportedly been waiting to hear since the two men struck a leadership pact over dinner in 1994 — three years before Labor came to power.

Skip to next paragraph Orlando Kissner/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images Pope Benedict XVI celebrating Mass in S&#227;o Paulo today. Pope Addresses Brazil’s Youth and Meets With the President The faithful carrying images of Pope Benedict XVI and Friar Galvao at the canonization ceremony today in Sao Paulo, Brazil, today. Pope Benedict XVI today in Sao Paulo, Brazil. “No effort should be spared in seeking out those Catholics who have fallen away and those who know little or nothing of Jesus Christ,” he told Brazilian bishops this afternoon at the Cathedral da Sé here. “What is required, in a word, is a mission of evangelization capable of engaging all the vital energies in this immense flock.” About 140 million Brazilians regard themselves as Catholics — the largest Roman Catholic population in the world. But many of them do not attend mass regularly, and the share of the population that identifies itself as Roman Catholic has contracted in less than a generation from nearly 90 percent to about two-thirds, thanks to the Protestant advance. The pope made his appeal in his characteristic way: He emphasized competing with the Pentecostal denominations first by meeting people’s spiritual needs with a back-to-basics Catholicism centered on preaching Christ’s message. He did not stint on providing for people’s social and material needs, but suggested, as he has in the past, that the spiritual dimension is more important, and the true work of the church. Even so, he took note of the dire circumstances in which millions of Latin Americans are mired, and signaled his agreement with what the church here calls a preferential option for the poor. When the people missionaries encounter “are living in poverty,” he said, “it is necessary to help them, as the first Christian communities did, by practicing solidarity and making them feel truly loved.” Within the larger strategy of competing with Protestant denominations, the canonization of Friar Antonio Galvão this morning was a way of marking traditional Catholic territory, and differentiating the church from its rivals. Daily life in Brazil is permeated by the presence of saints, from the names of neighborhoods, businesses and cities — including this one — to the plaster statues found in corner bars and the posters and paintings hung on the walls of homes, both humble and grand. Fast-growing Pentecostal groups, however, strongly disapprove of the popular focus on saints, which they regard as a form of idolatry forbidden by the Bible. In the 1990s, one Pentecostal preacher who was prominent on television even smashed an image of the Virgin Mary to bits during one of his programs, shocking many Brazilians and drawing widespread repudiation. “We Brazilians love to venerate the saints, like St. Anthony and St. George, but until now they’ve all been foreigners,” said Bernardo Leite Alves, a 39-year-old bus driver who said he often drives with an image of St. Sebastian on his windshield. As for Friar Antonio Galvão, he said: “This is a saint who is really, truly ours, born and bred here, who looks like us and has a name like ours.” Friar Antonio de Sant’Anna Galvão was born in 1739 about 100 miles from here, in Guaratinguetá, which Benedict will visit Saturday, and he died here in São Paulo 83 years later. During his lifetime, the city council here designated him a “man of peace and charity,” and he also earned a reputation for defending the poor, which stimulated both popular pilgrimages to his tomb and the use of “Frei Galvão’s pills,” which are said by his devotees to have healing powers. “The significance of Frei Galvão’s example lies in his willingness to be of service to the people whenever he was asked,” Benedict said today. “He was renowned as a counselor, he was a bringer of peace to souls and families and a dispenser of charity, especially toward the poor and the sick. He was greatly sought out as a confessor, because he was zealous, wise and prudent.” , who visited Brazil four times, engaged in a conscious strategy of building grass-roots fidelity to the church by naming hundreds of new saints worldwide. Despite his presence in Brazil to canonize Friar Galvão, Benedict himself has been more conservative, and officials say he will name far fewer saints. At the canonization mass this morning, the faithful were exuberant, waving banners with Frei Galvão’s image and chanting both his name and that of the pope. The church and the nation’s leading television network estimated that one million or more people attended the service, held at an airfield in a working-class area, but the police put the number closer to 800,000. “It is important that the pope be here, so that we can give him an injection of Brazilian joy and happiness,” said Rene Vilela, a 40-year-old bank clerk who was part of a group of 70 that flew here from Salvador, 1,200 miles away, to see the pontiff. “He’s a German, a bit cold and reserved, and so he can benefit from some of our oxygen.” Yet for all the affection they demonstrated, it was also clear that some in the crowd disagreed with the pope on fundamental issues. His condemnation of and contraception and his call for chastity at a meeting with young people on Thursday seemed particularly to go against the grain, in a country proud of its tolerance but ashamed of its poverty. “I’ve been in one-room houses in the slums where parents are trying to raise a dozen kids, and so I think his position on abortion is much too rigid,” said Maria Salete Simões, a 70-year-old retired school teacher. “This is a complicated, controversial subject that needs to be debated more, and the church’s position is just that — the church’s, and not that of society.” Romana Coutinho, a 25-year-old student, said she was pleased by the canonization of a Brazilian saint, but that it would not affect her attitude towards mass, which she said she attends “only sporadically.” She said that she had tried Pentecostal churches, but objected to their constant calls for donations, and wanted the Roman Catholic church to be more flexible on questions of both doctrine and liturgy. “God is joy, so the worship service should be more uplifting and animated,” she said. “If Jesus were alive today, I can’t imagine that he would espouse all of the things that are attributed to him, because the world has changed. The church needs to be more up to date.” More Articles in International &#x00bb; Start your 14-day free trial of TimesSelect now.

Dr. Puri, the chairman of the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, said that when the police sealed off Norris Hall, the site of most of the shooting, as a crime scene, his 24 faculty members, 80 doctoral students and 25 master’s students were left blocked from their laboratories. Their research ground to a halt; so did their ability to apply for jobs or for research grants. But offers to help began arriving almost immediately, he said. The Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands invited his whole faculty to work in its laboratories on paid sabbaticals. Dell, the computer manufacturer, donated 30 laptop and 20 desktop computers to replace those left stranded in the inaccessible laboratories. University opened their laboratories for internships. “Really, this has turned into a story of hope, not despair,” he said. He added, however, that as he looked toward the summer, he had to admit there was a small sense of dread, too. As the spirit of Hokie pride subsides on campus with the departure of students and faculty, Dr. Puri said he was not looking forward to facing a painful task he has put off for weeks: the writing of a job announcement to seek replacements for the two professors in his department who were killed. “Doing that strikes you with the finality of it all,” he said. “How, really, do you replace people who were colleagues, friends, individuals? You can’t.” More Articles in National &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Firefighters struggled early today to prevent a wildfire from reaching homes on the edge of Santa Catalina Island’s main town, as residents and visitors fled the resort island off the Southern California coast. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times A wildfire approached Santa Catalina Island&#146;s main city, Avalon, on Thursday. People wait to be evacuated from the town of Avalon, Calif., as smoke from a wildfire rises in the background on Santa Catalina Island. At least 160 firefighters, aided by four water-dropping helicopters and three retardant-dropping air tankers, battled flames through most of Thursday. The helicopters flew into the night and were back in the air at dawn today. Dozens of fire engines from as far away as Fresno arrived through the night aboard giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. The high-speed hovercraft can carry 60 tons of cargo over land or water, and are often used by the military on humanitarian missions. The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon on the island, which is more than 20 miles off the coast. Flames threatened the city limits of Avalon, where hundreds of people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries back to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas as ashes fell around them. A few homes on the island were burned, but firefighters worked to protect other properties late into the night, said Steven Hoefs, the chief of the Avalon fire department. Some 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. “We’re hanging in for now,” Chief Hoefs said. The blaze, which began five miles east of the island’s airport, grew to cover 4,000 acres, feeding on dry brush and scrub as winds steadily blew throughout the day and into the night on Thursday. Winds later calmed and the air grew more humid, although the threat of fire remained. An orange inferno loomed behind the quaint crescent-shaped harbor, the landmark 1929 Catalina Casino, and the homes, restaurants and tiny hotels clinging to slopes above the Avalon waterfront. A commercial building and several warehouses burned, and 175 utility customers lost electricity when power poles caught on fire. Overnight, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters were ferrying in firefighters, 32 at a time. Crews were being positioned at the city’s edge to protect homes. “We’re on defense mode for now,” Chief Hoefs said. In Avalon, authorities used a bullhorn to urge people to evacuate the city and head to the beach. Visitors to the island were directed to the historic Art Deco-style Casino building until it lost power, while residents were sent to another site along the harbor. The Catalina Express ferry service added several night departures of 400-passenger vessels from Avalon. Hundreds of residents and visitors boarded the ferries to reach the mainland. A family of eight said they had just enough time to pack some clothes and personal papers before fleeing. “I’m scared,” said Angelica Romero, 30, holding her 7-month-old daughter. “But what’s important is I have my children. The rest doesn’t matter.” At the mainland port of Long Beach, Kathy Troeger, a Santa Catalina resident, arrived by ferry with her three children and a friend’s daughter. Her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to help fight the blaze. “It was like a nightmare when we left,” she said. “You couldn’t breathe, and ash was falling like snow.” An evacuation center was set up at Cabrillo High School, where about 85 people had checked in, according to the Red Cross. Santa Catalina has been left parched by the same lack of rainfall that has made the Southern California mainland particularly susceptible to wildfires, like the one in Griffith Park in Los Angeles earlier this week. Firefighters were still working there today to surround what remained of the fire, which briefly chased people from adjacent homes and threatened the park’s landmark observatory and its zoo. Los Angeles officials had expected the Griffith Park fire to be fully contained by Thursday, two days after it peaked, and no visible flames remained, but fire crews were still building containment lines around the fire’s perimeter late into the night. Only 2 inches of rain have fallen on Santa Catalina since January. The island is long and fairly narrow, covering a total of 76 square miles of land area, most of it owned and kept as a preserve by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. various wildlife. The populated areas are served by helicopters and ferry boats from Los Angeles, Long Beach and other mainland harbors. Avalon, the main town, has a year-round population of 3,200, but swells to more than 10,000 on weekends and in the summer, according to the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/middleeast/11cnd-cheney.html?ex=1336536000&en=e5527828a00da7bb&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss	On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran - New York Times On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 BRUSSELS, May 11 — Vice President used the deck of an American aircraft carrier just 150 miles off ’s coast as the backdrop today to warn the country that the United States was prepared to use its naval power to keep Tehran from disrupting off oil routes or “gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Skip to next paragraph Vice President Dick Cheney on board the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf today. Back Story With The Times's David Sanger ( Little of what Mr. Cheney said in the cavernous hangar bay of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. John C. Stennis, one of two carriers whose strike groups are now in the Persian Gulf, was new. Each individual line had, in some form, been said before, at various points in the four-year-long nuclear standoff with Iran, and during the increasingly tense arguments over whether Iran is aiding the insurgents in Iraq. But Mr. Cheney stitched all of those warnings together, and the symbolism of sending the administration’s most famous hawk to deliver the speech so close to Iran’s coast was unmistakable. It also came just a week after Secretary of State talked briefly and inconclusively with Iran’s foreign minister, a step toward re-engagement with Iran that some in the administration have opposed. Mr. Cheney’s sharp warnings appeared to be part of a two-track administration campaign to push back at Iran, while leaving the door open to negotiations. It was almost exactly a year ago that the United States offered to negotiate with Iran as long as it first agreed to halt enriching uranium, a decision in which Mr. Cheney, participants said, was not a major player. Similarly, the speech today was not circulated broadly in the government before it was delivered, a senior American diplomat said. “He kind of runs by his own rules,” the official said. When President Bush ordered the two carriers into the Gulf late last year, senior administration officials said it was part of an effort to gain some negotiating leverage over the Iranians. At about the same time, American military personnel began capturing some Iranians in Iraq, and some of them are still held there. American officials have also been pressing Europeans banks and companies to avoid doing business with Tehran, in an effort to make it more difficult for the country to recycle its oil profits. Oil seemed to be on Mr. Cheney’s mind today, when he told an audience of 3,500 to 4,000 American service members on the Stennis that Iran would not be permitted to choke off oil shipments through the waters of the region. “With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we’re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike,” he said. “We’ll keep the sea lanes open. We’ll stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats. We’ll disrupt attacks on our own forces. We’ll continue bringing relief to those who suffer, and delivering justice to the enemies of freedom. And we’ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Some experts on Iran have questioned whether the threats that administration officials occasionally deliver to Iran aid or undercut the diplomacy with the country. “The problem with the two-track policy is that the first track — coercion, sanctions, naval deployments — can undercut the results on the second track,” said Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar at the Council of Foreign Relations and the author of “Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic” (Henry Holt, 2006). “There are some in Tehran who will look at Cheney on that carrier and say that everything Rice is offering is not real. What’s real, to their mind, are the coercive policies Cheney is describing. “This is a case where we are trying to get through negotiations what, so far, we couldn’t get through coercion.” The symbols of coercion were part of the backdrop on the Stennis: Mr. Cheney spoke in front of five F-18 Super Hornet warplanes. But mindful of the lasting imagery of President Bush on another carrier a little more than four years ago, there were no signs proclaiming success, much less “Mission Accomplished.” Instead, Mr. Cheney repeated his arguments about the danger of early withdrawal from Iraq. “I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat,” Mr. Cheney said. “We want to complete the mission, we want to get it done right, and then we want to return home with honor.” Mr. Cheney is on a weeklong visit to the Middle East, and made Iraq his first stop on Wednesday and Thursday. He spoke to American troops stationed near ’s birthplace, Tikrit, telling them in somber tones that they still had a tough fight ahead of them. His assessment stood in stark contrast to the one he made two years ago, when he declared in an interview with CNN that the insurgency in Iraq was in its “last throes.” The United States remains at odds with Iran over its uranium-enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful nuclear energy, but which America and its Western allies say is intended instead to produce atomic weapons. Administration officials have also said that weapons are being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and that insurgents may be getting training in bomb-making and bomb-placing techniques in Iran. The Iranian government denies sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. Mr. Cheney visited the U.S.S. John C. Stennis before, in March 2002, at a time when he was trying to build support for the invasion of Iraq. He also visited Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where the president of Iran, , is expected to arrive in the next few days. Mr. Cheney’s tour is also scheduled to include visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting for this article from Baghdad, and Graham Bowley contributed from New York.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/americas/11cnd-pope.html	Pope Canonizes Brazil&#8217;s First Native-Born Saint - New York Times Pope Canonizes Brazil’s First Native-Born Saint Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 , May 11 — After canonizing Brazil’s first native-born saint and receiving a bracing dose of Brazilian-style religious fervor at an outdoor mass here today, called for more forceful evangelization efforts throughout Latin America to counter growing conversions to Pentecostal Protestant groups. Skip to next paragraph Orlando Kissner/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images Pope Benedict XVI celebrating Mass in S&#227;o Paulo today. Pope Addresses Brazil’s Youth and Meets With the President The faithful carrying images of Pope Benedict XVI and Friar Galvao at the canonization ceremony today in Sao Paulo, Brazil, today. Pope Benedict XVI today in Sao Paulo, Brazil. “No effort should be spared in seeking out those Catholics who have fallen away and those who know little or nothing of Jesus Christ,” he told Brazilian bishops this afternoon at the Cathedral da Sé here. “What is required, in a word, is a mission of evangelization capable of engaging all the vital energies in this immense flock.” About 140 million Brazilians regard themselves as Catholics — the largest Roman Catholic population in the world. But many of them do not attend mass regularly, and the share of the population that identifies itself as Roman Catholic has contracted in less than a generation from nearly 90 percent to about two-thirds, thanks to the Protestant advance. The pope made his appeal in his characteristic way: He emphasized competing with the Pentecostal denominations first by meeting people’s spiritual needs with a back-to-basics Catholicism centered on preaching Christ’s message. He did not stint on providing for people’s social and material needs, but suggested, as he has in the past, that the spiritual dimension is more important, and the true work of the church. Even so, he took note of the dire circumstances in which millions of Latin Americans are mired, and signaled his agreement with what the church here calls a preferential option for the poor. When the people missionaries encounter “are living in poverty,” he said, “it is necessary to help them, as the first Christian communities did, by practicing solidarity and making them feel truly loved.” Within the larger strategy of competing with Protestant denominations, the canonization of Friar Antonio Galvão this morning was a way of marking traditional Catholic territory, and differentiating the church from its rivals. Daily life in Brazil is permeated by the presence of saints, from the names of neighborhoods, businesses and cities — including this one — to the plaster statues found in corner bars and the posters and paintings hung on the walls of homes, both humble and grand. Fast-growing Pentecostal groups, however, strongly disapprove of the popular focus on saints, which they regard as a form of idolatry forbidden by the Bible. In the 1990s, one Pentecostal preacher who was prominent on television even smashed an image of the Virgin Mary to bits during one of his programs, shocking many Brazilians and drawing widespread repudiation. “We Brazilians love to venerate the saints, like St. Anthony and St. George, but until now they’ve all been foreigners,” said Bernardo Leite Alves, a 39-year-old bus driver who said he often drives with an image of St. Sebastian on his windshield. As for Friar Antonio Galvão, he said: “This is a saint who is really, truly ours, born and bred here, who looks like us and has a name like ours.” Friar Antonio de Sant’Anna Galvão was born in 1739 about 100 miles from here, in Guaratinguetá, which Benedict will visit Saturday, and he died here in São Paulo 83 years later. During his lifetime, the city council here designated him a “man of peace and charity,” and he also earned a reputation for defending the poor, which stimulated both popular pilgrimages to his tomb and the use of “Frei Galvão’s pills,” which are said by his devotees to have healing powers. “The significance of Frei Galvão’s example lies in his willingness to be of service to the people whenever he was asked,” Benedict said today. “He was renowned as a counselor, he was a bringer of peace to souls and families and a dispenser of charity, especially toward the poor and the sick. He was greatly sought out as a confessor, because he was zealous, wise and prudent.” , who visited Brazil four times, engaged in a conscious strategy of building grass-roots fidelity to the church by naming hundreds of new saints worldwide. Despite his presence in Brazil to canonize Friar Galvão, Benedict himself has been more conservative, and officials say he will name far fewer saints. At the canonization mass this morning, the faithful were exuberant, waving banners with Frei Galvão’s image and chanting both his name and that of the pope. The church and the nation’s leading television network estimated that one million or more people attended the service, held at an airfield in a working-class area, but the police put the number closer to 800,000. “It is important that the pope be here, so that we can give him an injection of Brazilian joy and happiness,” said Rene Vilela, a 40-year-old bank clerk who was part of a group of 70 that flew here from Salvador, 1,200 miles away, to see the pontiff. “He’s a German, a bit cold and reserved, and so he can benefit from some of our oxygen.” Yet for all the affection they demonstrated, it was also clear that some in the crowd disagreed with the pope on fundamental issues. His condemnation of and contraception and his call for chastity at a meeting with young people on Thursday seemed particularly to go against the grain, in a country proud of its tolerance but ashamed of its poverty. “I’ve been in one-room houses in the slums where parents are trying to raise a dozen kids, and so I think his position on abortion is much too rigid,” said Maria Salete Simões, a 70-year-old retired school teacher. “This is a complicated, controversial subject that needs to be debated more, and the church’s position is just that — the church’s, and not that of society.” Romana Coutinho, a 25-year-old student, said she was pleased by the canonization of a Brazilian saint, but that it would not affect her attitude towards mass, which she said she attends “only sporadically.” She said that she had tried Pentecostal churches, but objected to their constant calls for donations, and wanted the Roman Catholic church to be more flexible on questions of both doctrine and liturgy. “God is joy, so the worship service should be more uplifting and animated,” she said. “If Jesus were alive today, I can’t imagine that he would espouse all of the things that are attributed to him, because the world has changed. The church needs to be more up to date.” More Articles in International &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

But Mr. Giuliani argued that the presidential election should not turn on social issues, but on which party would better protect the nation from terrorism. Mr. Giuliani suggested that his own record as mayor of New York – leading the city after the attacks of Sept. 11 and overseeing a dramatic decline in violent crime during his eight years in Gracie Mansion – made him the most electable of the Republican candidates, no matter his stand on issues like abortion. During last week’s debate among Republicans vying for their party’s 2008 presidential nomination, the former New York City mayor was criticized for his halting and apparently contradictory responses to questions about his views on abortion rights. Critics have said that he is trying to run from a record that is much more liberal than the views of the Republican Party’s core voters on the issue. The speech by Mr. Giuliani reflected a critical strategic decision – other campaigns used the word gamble – as he seeks to overcome what has been one of the fundamental obstacles to winning the nomination: his long history, as a Northeast Republican in a party increasingly dominated by southern and midwestern conservatives, of breaking with much of the party’s base on issues that are of intense importance to them. Mr. Giuliani told his audience today that he knew that some voters might disagree with him. But he urged the party to become a “big tent” that could include people with a range of views on the subject. At the same time, he said he owed it to them to be forthright about his own views. “I should honestly tell you what I believe,” Mr. Giuliani said. “I should honestly tell you the things that I can evolve on, and the things that I can’t, and then you should decide.” He said, as he has before, that he personally opposed abortion but believed in a woman’s right to make her own decisions; that he believes in the right to bear arms, but that as mayor of New York, he favored certain aspects of gun control; and that while he opposes gay marriage, he supports protecting gay rights, something he said he did as mayor. On abortion, he said he was open to seeking ways to limit the procedure, but he was not open to limiting the right to have it. “In a country like ours, where people of good faith, people who are equally decent and equally moral and equally religious, where they come to different conclusions about this, about something so very, very personal, I think you have to respect their viewpoint,” he said. “I would grant women the right to make that choice.” He said that while his views might put him at odds with many in his own party, he said he did not believe many of them would base their votes on a single issue. He asked the crowd to weigh other factors too, including “fighting terrorism effectively, being on offense against terror, having a growth economy, having a fiscal conservative.” Mr. Giuliani’s aides say their polling has found a relatively small number of voters who would base their vote solely on abortion. They have also said that they are counting on the impression many voters seem to have of Mr. Giuliani as a tough leader who helped turn around New York City in the 1990s, and carried it through the attacks of Sept. 11.

Giuliani delivered his speech outlining his social views to a conservative audience at Houston Baptist College. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 HOUSTON, May 11 – offered a direct challenge to orthodoxy on Friday, asserting that his support for rights, gun control and gay rights should not disqualify him from winning the party’s presidential nomination and that Republicans need to be tolerant of dissenting views on those issues if they want to hold the White House.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/middleeast/11cnd-cheney.html	On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran - New York Times On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 BRUSSELS, May 11 — Vice President used the deck of an American aircraft carrier just 150 miles off ’s coast as the backdrop today to warn the country that the United States was prepared to use its naval power to keep Tehran from disrupting off oil routes or “gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Skip to next paragraph Vice President Dick Cheney on board the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf today. Back Story With The Times's David Sanger ( Little of what Mr. Cheney said in the cavernous hangar bay of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. John C. Stennis, one of two carriers whose strike groups are now in the Persian Gulf, was new. Each individual line had, in some form, been said before, at various points in the four-year-long nuclear standoff with Iran, and during the increasingly tense arguments over whether Iran is aiding the insurgents in Iraq. But Mr. Cheney stitched all of those warnings together, and the symbolism of sending the administration’s most famous hawk to deliver the speech so close to Iran’s coast was unmistakable. It also came just a week after Secretary of State talked briefly and inconclusively with Iran’s foreign minister, a step toward re-engagement with Iran that some in the administration have opposed. Mr. Cheney’s sharp warnings appeared to be part of a two-track administration campaign to push back at Iran, while leaving the door open to negotiations. It was almost exactly a year ago that the United States offered to negotiate with Iran as long as it first agreed to halt enriching uranium, a decision in which Mr. Cheney, participants said, was not a major player. Similarly, the speech today was not circulated broadly in the government before it was delivered, a senior American diplomat said. “He kind of runs by his own rules,” the official said. When President Bush ordered the two carriers into the Gulf late last year, senior administration officials said it was part of an effort to gain some negotiating leverage over the Iranians. At about the same time, American military personnel began capturing some Iranians in Iraq, and some of them are still held there. American officials have also been pressing Europeans banks and companies to avoid doing business with Tehran, in an effort to make it more difficult for the country to recycle its oil profits. Oil seemed to be on Mr. Cheney’s mind today, when he told an audience of 3,500 to 4,000 American service members on the Stennis that Iran would not be permitted to choke off oil shipments through the waters of the region. “With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we’re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike,” he said. “We’ll keep the sea lanes open. We’ll stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats. We’ll disrupt attacks on our own forces. We’ll continue bringing relief to those who suffer, and delivering justice to the enemies of freedom. And we’ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Some experts on Iran have questioned whether the threats that administration officials occasionally deliver to Iran aid or undercut the diplomacy with the country. “The problem with the two-track policy is that the first track — coercion, sanctions, naval deployments — can undercut the results on the second track,” said Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar at the Council of Foreign Relations and the author of “Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic” (Henry Holt, 2006). “There are some in Tehran who will look at Cheney on that carrier and say that everything Rice is offering is not real. What’s real, to their mind, are the coercive policies Cheney is describing. “This is a case where we are trying to get through negotiations what, so far, we couldn’t get through coercion.” The symbols of coercion were part of the backdrop on the Stennis: Mr. Cheney spoke in front of five F-18 Super Hornet warplanes. But mindful of the lasting imagery of President Bush on another carrier a little more than four years ago, there were no signs proclaiming success, much less “Mission Accomplished.” Instead, Mr. Cheney repeated his arguments about the danger of early withdrawal from Iraq. “I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat,” Mr. Cheney said. “We want to complete the mission, we want to get it done right, and then we want to return home with honor.” Mr. Cheney is on a weeklong visit to the Middle East, and made Iraq his first stop on Wednesday and Thursday. He spoke to American troops stationed near ’s birthplace, Tikrit, telling them in somber tones that they still had a tough fight ahead of them. His assessment stood in stark contrast to the one he made two years ago, when he declared in an interview with CNN that the insurgency in Iraq was in its “last throes.” The United States remains at odds with Iran over its uranium-enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful nuclear energy, but which America and its Western allies say is intended instead to produce atomic weapons. Administration officials have also said that weapons are being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and that insurgents may be getting training in bomb-making and bomb-placing techniques in Iran. The Iranian government denies sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. Mr. Cheney visited the U.S.S. John C. Stennis before, in March 2002, at a time when he was trying to build support for the invasion of Iraq. He also visited Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where the president of Iran, , is expected to arrive in the next few days. Mr. Cheney’s tour is also scheduled to include visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting for this article from Baghdad, and Graham Bowley contributed from New York.

In a court filing yesterday morning, department lawyers said they were no longer asking the appeals court in Washington to limit the lawyers to three visits with detainees at the Guant&#225;namo naval base, where about 380 men are now held. A series of department proposals to curtail detainees&#8217; lawyers drew wide attention and was criticized by legal groups and in Congress, with opponents saying the Bush administration was denying detainees the most rudimentary tools to challenge their confinement. &#8220;After further consideration of this issue by the Department of Defense,&#8221; the tersely worded filing said, the government &#8220;is no longer seeking to incorporate a three-visit threshold for the number of counsel visits.&#8221; But the filing made clear that the administration would continue to seek other limitations on the lawyers. These would include requests to permit only one visit for a detainee to authorize a lawyer to handle his case; to screen mail sent by lawyers; and to allow government officials, on their own, to deny lawyers access to secret evidence used against detainees by military panels. The filing came days before arguments are scheduled in a case that has become one of the main battlegrounds in the legal struggle over the administration&#8217;s detention policies. In that case, eight detainees have challenged the findings that they are properly being held as enemy combatants. Arguments are scheduled for Tuesday in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The proposal that would have cut off lawyers&#8217; access to their clients had been controversial, partly because it came as many detainees were resisting cooperating with their lawyers, adding a new layer of complexity to the legal battle over Guant&#225;namo. Some critics said that yesterday&#8217;s government action was a strategic retreat on the proposal that had drawn the most fire, and that the remaining proposed restrictions would damage the relationships between lawyers and detainees. &#8220;This is window dressing,&#8221; said Vincent Warren, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, an advocacy group that has coordinated the detainees&#8217; lawyers. &#8220;The remaining restrictions &#151; which include monitoring attorney-client mail &#151; makes meaningful representation impossible,&#8221; Mr. Warren said. Barry M. Kamins, president of the New York City Bar Association and one of the most outspoken critics of the department proposals, said yesterday&#8217;s action would not win over lawyers&#8217; groups that had opposed the proposals. &#8220;The easing of this one rule barely begins to address the egregious violations of the attorney-client relationship,&#8221; Mr. Kamins said. But some supporters of the department&#8217;s proposal said critics had not paid adequate attention to the government&#8217;s accusations that the restrictions were necessary because the detainees&#8217; lawyers had caused unrest at Guant&#225;namo by providing the detainees information about terrorist attacks and other events. &#8220;There are real national security issues here,&#8221; said Gregory S. McNeal, a professor at the Dickinson School of Law who has been a consultant to war-crimes prosecutors at Guant&#225;namo. One new rule the Justice Department is still proposing would permit government officials to unilaterally deny the lawyers access to any secret evidence used by military panels to determine that their clients were enemy combatants, which would be a reversal of existing procedures. Another proposal declares that if officials conclude that detainees&#8217; lawyers violate any of the rules governing their actions, the government &#8220;may bar counsel from visiting the U.S. Naval Base at Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba&#8221; without any court authorization. Under the current practice, lawyers said, disputes have been addressed by a federal magistrate. Some critics of the administration said they saw the department&#8217;s decision as the most recent example of a pattern of withdrawing proposals that draw extensive criticism just before courts are called on to rule. In their original request for the new rules, the department&#8217;s lawyers had said commanders at Guant&#225;namo had called for the restrictions because of &#8220;intractable problems and threats to security at Guant&#225;namo&#8221; that they blamed on civilian lawyers for detainees. But in an interview reported in The Miami Herald last week, Rear Adm. Harry B. Harris, the commander at Guant&#225;namo, was quoted as saying that the officers had changed their view. Admiral Harris said that the remarks cited by the department had been made last summer after a riot and the suicides of three detainees, and that the circumstances were now less turbulent. Yesterday&#8217;s court filing included a two-page affidavit dated Thursday, in which Admiral Harris said that the detention facility &#8220;has re-evaluated its requirements to ensure that its procedures concerning attorney visitation and related matters are not more stringent than necessary.&#8221; He declined an interview request yesterday. A Pentagon spokesman, Cmdr. Jeffrey D. Gordon, said the remaining restrictions the government was seeking in court &#8220;remain warranted and appropriate in light of operations at Guant&#225;namo.&#8221; A spokesman for the department, Erik Ablin, said that in the court case &#8220;the position of the United States is driven by base security operational and resource concerns.&#8221; More Articles in Washington &#x00bb; Explore TimesSelect with a no-risk 14-day free trial.

A series of department proposals to curtail detainees&#8217; lawyers drew wide attention and was criticized by legal groups and in Congress, with opponents saying the Bush administration was denying detainees the most rudimentary tools to challenge their confinement. &#8220;After further consideration of this issue by the Department of Defense,&#8221; the tersely worded filing said, the government &#8220;is no longer seeking to incorporate a three-visit threshold for the number of counsel visits.&#8221; But the filing made clear that the administration would continue to seek other limitations on the lawyers. These would include requests to permit only one visit for a detainee to authorize a lawyer to handle his case; to screen mail sent by lawyers; and to allow government officials, on their own, to deny lawyers access to secret evidence used against detainees by military panels. The filing came days before arguments are scheduled in a case that has become one of the main battlegrounds in the legal struggle over the administration&#8217;s detention policies. In that case, eight detainees have challenged the findings that they are properly being held as enemy combatants. Arguments are scheduled for Tuesday in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The proposal that would have cut off lawyers&#8217; access to their clients had been controversial, partly because it came as many detainees were resisting cooperating with their lawyers, adding a new layer of complexity to the legal battle over Guant&#225;namo. Some critics said that yesterday&#8217;s government action was a strategic retreat on the proposal that had drawn the most fire, and that the remaining proposed restrictions would damage the relationships between lawyers and detainees. &#8220;This is window dressing,&#8221; said Vincent Warren, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, an advocacy group that has coordinated the detainees&#8217; lawyers. &#8220;The remaining restrictions &#151; which include monitoring attorney-client mail &#151; makes meaningful representation impossible,&#8221; Mr. Warren said. Barry M. Kamins, president of the New York City Bar Association and one of the most outspoken critics of the department proposals, said yesterday&#8217;s action would not win over lawyers&#8217; groups that had opposed the proposals. &#8220;The easing of this one rule barely begins to address the egregious violations of the attorney-client relationship,&#8221; Mr. Kamins said. But some supporters of the department&#8217;s proposal said critics had not paid adequate attention to the government&#8217;s accusations that the restrictions were necessary because the detainees&#8217; lawyers had caused unrest at Guant&#225;namo by providing the detainees information about terrorist attacks and other events. &#8220;There are real national security issues here,&#8221; said Gregory S. McNeal, a professor at the Dickinson School of Law who has been a consultant to war-crimes prosecutors at Guant&#225;namo. One new rule the Justice Department is still proposing would permit government officials to unilaterally deny the lawyers access to any secret evidence used by military panels to determine that their clients were enemy combatants, which would be a reversal of existing procedures. Another proposal declares that if officials conclude that detainees&#8217; lawyers violate any of the rules governing their actions, the government &#8220;may bar counsel from visiting the U.S. Naval Base at Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba&#8221; without any court authorization. Under the current practice, lawyers said, disputes have been addressed by a federal magistrate. Some critics of the administration said they saw the department&#8217;s decision as the most recent example of a pattern of withdrawing proposals that draw extensive criticism just before courts are called on to rule. In their original request for the new rules, the department&#8217;s lawyers had said commanders at Guant&#225;namo had called for the restrictions because of &#8220;intractable problems and threats to security at Guant&#225;namo&#8221; that they blamed on civilian lawyers for detainees. But in an interview reported in The Miami Herald last week, Rear Adm. Harry B. Harris, the commander at Guant&#225;namo, was quoted as saying that the officers had changed their view. Admiral Harris said that the remarks cited by the department had been made last summer after a riot and the suicides of three detainees, and that the circumstances were now less turbulent. Yesterday&#8217;s court filing included a two-page affidavit dated Thursday, in which Admiral Harris said that the detention facility &#8220;has re-evaluated its requirements to ensure that its procedures concerning attorney visitation and related matters are not more stringent than necessary.&#8221; He declined an interview request yesterday. A Pentagon spokesman, Cmdr. Jeffrey D. Gordon, said the remaining restrictions the government was seeking in court &#8220;remain warranted and appropriate in light of operations at Guant&#225;namo.&#8221; A spokesman for the department, Erik Ablin, said that in the court case &#8220;the position of the United States is driven by base security operational and resource concerns.&#8221; More Articles in Washington &#x00bb; Explore TimesSelect with a no-risk 14-day free trial.

Referring to Monica M. Goodling, a 31-year-old, relatively inexperienced lawyer who had only recently arrived in the office, the boss added, “She believes you’re a Democrat and doesn’t feel you can be trusted.” Ms. Ashton’s ouster — she left the Executive Office for United States Attorneys for another Justice Department post two weeks later — was a critical early step in a plan that would later culminate in the ouster of nine Ms. Goodling would soon be quizzing applicants for civil service jobs at Justice Department headquarters with questions that several United States attorneys said were inappropriate, like who was their favorite president and Supreme Court justice. One department official said an applicant was even asked, “Have you ever cheated on your wife?” Ms. Goodling also moved to block the hiring of prosecutors with résumés that suggested they might be Democrats, even though they were seeking posts that were supposed to be nonpartisan, two department officials said. And she helped maintain lists of all the United States attorneys that graded their loyalty to the Bush administration, including work on past political campaigns, and noted if they were members of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group. By the time Ms. Goodling resigned in April — after her role in the firing of the prosecutors became public and she had been promoted to the role of White House liaison — she and other senior department officials had revamped personnel practices affecting employees from the top of the agency to the bottom. The people who spoke about Ms. Goodling’s role at the department, including eight current Justice Department lawyers and staff, did so only on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Several added that they found her activities objectionable and damaging to the integrity of the department. Ms. Goodling, who is under investigation by the department’s inspector general and ethics office, as well as Congress, has declined to testify before a House panel, citing her Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid making self-incriminating statements. Her lawyer, John M. Dowd, declined to comment on Friday. A judge in Federal District Court in Washington signed an order Friday to grant Ms. Goodling limited immunity, which will allow House investigators to compel her to answer questions. Justice Department officials declined to respond to questions about Ms. Goodling’s actions and refused to allow some agency employees to speak with a reporter about them. “Whether or not Ms. Goodling engaged in prohibited personnel practices is the subject of an ongoing investigation,” a written statement said. “Given the ongoing nature of the investigation, we are unable to comment on the allegations.” H. E. Cummins III, one of the fired prosecutors, said Justice Department officials should have recognized that Ms. Goodling’s strategy was flawed from the start. “She was inexperienced, way too naïve and a little overzealous,” said Mr. Cummins, from Arkansas. “She might have somehow figured that what she was doing was the right thing. But a more experienced person would understand you don’t help the party by trying to put political people in there. You put the best people you can find in there.” Ms. Goodling, now 33, arrived at the department at the start of the Bush administration after working as an opposition researcher for the during the 2000 presidential campaign. Her legal experience was limited; she had graduated in 1999 from Regent University School of Law, which was founded by .

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/12/health/12cancer.html	In New Hampshire, Soft Sell Eases Vaccine Fears - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior In New Hampshire, Soft Sell Eases Vaccine Fears Cheryl Senter/The New York Times Sophia Wheat, 16, of Hooksett, N.H., being given an HPV vaccination this month at Sanders Family Medicine in Concord, N.H. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 CONCORD, N.H. — A vaccine for a sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical may be creating controversy across the country, but in physicians say so many people want it that they cannot satisfy the demand. Skip to next paragraph Cheryl Senter/The New York Times Gardasil, given in three doses over six months, costs $360. The New Hampshire experience contrasts sharply with that in many other states, where opponents have cited factors like the drug manufacturer’s profit motive and the fear that inoculating young girls will encourage them to be sexually active. New Hampshire has critics of the vaccine, too. But its health officials, wanting to encourage use of the vaccine, called Gardasil, say they have hit on an optimal method: making it voluntary and giving it free to girls ages 11 to 18. In many of the more than 20 states that are considering bills to require girls to be vaccinated, a backlash has developed. In , a lawmakers’ revolt overwhelmingly overturned Gov. ’s effort to mandate recently became the sole state with a law requiring the vaccine for girls entering the sixth grade but allowing parents to refuse shots for their children. In New Hampshire, where people wear their independent streaks with pride, “I suspect that we’re not seeing a significant controversy because there was a never a discussion about whether to make this mandatory,” said Greg Moore, a spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department “This is a different type of vaccine rollout than we have ever seen,” Mr. Moore said. “We usually have to bust our hump every September to convince people to get their Sanders Family Medicine in Concord has a four-month waiting list for the vaccine, which guards against four strains of the . Exeter Pediatric Associates, one of the state’s largest practices, has given out all 380 doses it was supplied by the state since January and has a long waiting list for the next month’s supply, Dr. Wendy Gladstone said. Penacook Family Physicians has devised an elaborate triage system. Ardell Currier, a nurse practitioner, said Penacook first vaccinated 18-year-olds and then younger girls who have been sexually active, take birth control and “have had an or have had health issues, particularly psychiatric conditions” that may make them more likely to have sex. “The ethical dilemma is whom do we give that vaccine to,” Ms. Currier said. New Hampshire is spending $4.9 million on Gardasil this year, said Dr. Jose Montero, the state epidemiologist. That is 28 percent of the state immunization budget, which obtains half its financing from federal money and half from private insurers, Dr. Montero said. The legislature does not have to vote on the program or appropriate money, he added. Money for other immunization programs was not reduced, he said. Since January, the state has distributed more than 14,000 doses and is trying to obtain more doses for physicians with waiting lists. Dr. Montero said he would evaluate whether to ask for more money to buy more vaccine. At least two other states, South Dakota and Washington, are echoing the program here. South Dakota began providing Gardasil free to the same age group in late January with $1.7 million approved by the Legislature and $7.5 million in federal money, Health Secretary Doneen Hollingsworth said. South Dakota is a relatively conservative state that tried last year to ban most abortions only to have the ban repealed in a referendum. Even so, when it came to the HPV vaccine, Ms. Hollingsworth said, “the naysayers, there weren’t a lot of them, and they weren’t terribly loud.” Ms. Hollingsworth said the state had provided almost 20,000 doses. “There’s been a tremendous amount of interest,” she added. “But I haven’t heard anything about anybody running out” of vaccine. In Washington, the Llegislature just approved $10 million for voluntary vaccination for 94,000 girls over the next two years. “We basically want to see as many people get this as possible,” said Tim Church, a spokesman for the Health Department who said Washington would primarily focus on 11- and 12-year-olds on the theory that it is best to be vaccinated before being sexually active. The cost of Gardasil, which is administered in three doses over six months, is normally $360. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend it for ages 9 to 26. In New Hampshire, girls outside the 11-to-18 range of the free pool have to pay out of pocket or through insurance. Some families of 11- to 18-year-olds have been doing that, rather than wait for the free vaccine. Physicians say the supply of vaccine for patients who are paying for it themselves or through insurance, produced by Merck, has been adequate. Exeter Pediatric Associates has given 480 doses of privately ordered vaccine since December, Dr. Gladstone said. Even women older than 26 are requesting it. Starting in July, the biggest insurer in the state, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, will not cover vaccines for HPV and other illnesses for 11- to 18-year-olds because they are eligible for the free pool, which receives money from Anthem, said a spokesman, Chris Dugan. Other insurers are expected to do the same, Mr. Dugan said. Doctors said that could increase the backlog for the free vaccine. Melissa Whitney of Hampstead has put her 13- and 11-year-olds on the waiting list at Exeter. “They said there were many people ahead of me, and, ‘As soon as we get some more vaccine in, we’ll give you a call,’ ” Ms. Whitney said. On Wednesday, Sophia Wheat, 16, received her second injection at Sanders Family Medicine, a few weeks later than the optimal time because of the limited supply, said Dr. Elizabeth Sanders, who is careful to inform patients that Gardasil is not effective against all strains of HPV or other “It sounded really important, so I thought it would be a good idea,” Sophia said as a medical assistant placed a yellow crayon-shaped bandage on her arm. To sort through waiting lists, some doctors give priority to older girls, some to younger ones and some to girls who have already received a dose. Yet, not everyone is rushing for the vaccine. Ms. Currier at Penacook Family Physicians said her practice had called all its 18-year-olds first, especially to recruit “the folks most at risk for HPV, because they are going to be not those most engaged in health care.” About half the 18-year-olds or their parents refused it, “most because they feel it’s too new,” Ms. Currier said. “Some parents of younger girls feel that they’re not sexually active, so they don’t need it,” she added. Maggie Theriault, a nurse from Merrimack, declined Gardasil for her 14-year-old, Samantha, because “I haven’t really investigated it all that much.” “When I did hear about it originally,” Ms. Theriault said, “I wanted her to have it. But I don’t want to be ignorant and I don’t want to rush. “She’s not sexually active yet . We have an agreement that she’s not going to be until, hopefully, she’s at least 18. I’m not saying that we won’t ever get it. It’s just that we’re going to wait a bit.” When Kimberly Barlow arranged for three of her daughters, ages 18, 15, and 13, to receive the inoculation, “my mom was actually against me getting it for them,” Ms. Barlow said. “She was saying it would lead to their promiscuity and stuff,” Ms. Barlow said. “I just thought that it was an option to do something that will likely prevent cervical cancer in my children.” Pauline Doucette put her daughter Olivia, 13, a volleyball player and karate fan, on her pediatrician’s list in October, three months before it was available. Olivia’s grandmother had cervical cancer, which is not hereditary, and Ms. Doucette had a precancerous condition, making Olivia aware of the illness. Ms. Doucette said she discussed the sexual transmission of the virus with Olivia, who has received two doses. “Most everybody in school,” Olivia said, “is getting the shot.” Next Article in Health (1 of 16) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

On Wednesday, Sophia Wheat, 16, received her second injection at Sanders Family Medicine, a few weeks later than the optimal time because of the limited supply, said Dr. Elizabeth Sanders, who is careful to inform patients that Gardasil is not effective against all strains of HPV or other “It sounded really important, so I thought it would be a good idea,” Sophia said as a medical assistant placed a yellow crayon-shaped bandage on her arm. To sort through waiting lists, some doctors give priority to older girls, some to younger ones and some to girls who have already received a dose. Yet, not everyone is rushing for the vaccine. Ms. Currier at Penacook Family Physicians said her practice had called all its 18-year-olds first, especially to recruit “the folks most at risk for HPV, because they are going to be not those most engaged in health care.” About half the 18-year-olds or their parents refused it, “most because they feel it’s too new,” Ms. Currier said. “Some parents of younger girls feel that they’re not sexually active, so they don’t need it,” she added. Maggie Theriault, a nurse from Merrimack, declined Gardasil for her 14-year-old, Samantha, because “I haven’t really investigated it all that much.” “When I did hear about it originally,” Ms. Theriault said, “I wanted her to have it. But I don’t want to be ignorant and I don’t want to rush. “She’s not sexually active yet . We have an agreement that she’s not going to be until, hopefully, she’s at least 18. I’m not saying that we won’t ever get it. It’s just that we’re going to wait a bit.” When Kimberly Barlow arranged for three of her daughters, ages 18, 15, and 13, to receive the inoculation, “my mom was actually against me getting it for them,” Ms. Barlow said. “She was saying it would lead to their promiscuity and stuff,” Ms. Barlow said. “I just thought that it was an option to do something that will likely prevent cervical cancer in my children.” Pauline Doucette put her daughter Olivia, 13, a volleyball player and karate fan, on her pediatrician’s list in October, three months before it was available. Olivia’s grandmother had cervical cancer, which is not hereditary, and Ms. Doucette had a precancerous condition, making Olivia aware of the illness. Ms. Doucette said she discussed the sexual transmission of the virus with Olivia, who has received two doses. “Most everybody in school,” Olivia said, “is getting the shot.” Next Article in Health (1 of 16) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Skip to next paragraph The Reach of War Go to Complete Coverage » Using an average of $50 a barrel, the report said the discrepancy was valued at $5 million to $15 million daily. The report does not give a final conclusion on what happened to the missing fraction of the roughly two million barrels pumped by Iraq each day, but the findings are sure to reinforce longstanding suspicions that smugglers, insurgents and corrupt officials control significant parts of the country’s oil industry. The report also covered alternative explanations for the billions of dollars worth of discrepancies, including the possibility that Iraq has been consistently overstating its oil production. Iraq and the State Department, which reports the numbers, have been under relentless pressure to show tangible progress in Iraq by raising production levels, which have languished well below the United States goal of three million barrels a day. Virtually the entire economy of Iraq is dependent on oil revenues. The draft report, expected to be released within the next week, was prepared by the United States with the help of government energy analysts, and was provided to The New York Times by a separate government office that received a review copy. The accountability office declined to provide a copy or to discuss the draft. Paul Anderson, a spokesman for the office, said only that “we don’t discuss draft reports.” But a State Department official who works on energy issues said that there were several possible explanations for the discrepancy, including the loss of oil through sabotage of pipelines and inaccurate reporting of production in southern Iraq, where engineers may not properly account for water that is pumped along with oil in the fields there. “It could also be theft,” the official said, with suspicion falling primarily on Shiite militias in the south. “Crude oil is not as lucrative in the region as refined products, but we’re not ruling that out either.” Iraqi and American officials have previously said that smuggling of refined products like gasoline and kerosene is probably costing Iraq billions of dollars a year in lost revenues. The smuggling of those products is particularly feared because officials believe that a large fraction of the proceeds go to insurgent groups. Crude oil is much more difficult to smuggle because it must be shipped to refineries and turned into the more valuable refined products before it can be sold on the market. The Shiite militia groups hold sway around the rich oil fields of southern Iraq, which dominate the country’s oil production, the State Department official said. For that reason, he said, the Shiite militias are more likely to be involved in theft there than the largely Sunni insurgents, who are believed to benefit mostly from smuggling refined products in the north. In the south, the official said, “There is not an issue of insurgency, per se, but it could be funding Shia factions, and that could very well be true.” “That would be a concern if they were using smuggling money to blow up American soldiers or kill Sunnis or do anything that could harm the unity of the country,” the official said. The report by the accountability office is the most comprehensive look yet at faltering American efforts to rebuild Iraq’s oil and electricity sectors. For the analysis of Iraq’s oil production, the accountability office called upon experts at the Energy Information Administration within the United States Department of Energy , which has long experience in analyzing oil production and exports worldwide. Erik Kreil, an oil expert at the information administration who is familiar with the analysis, said a review of industry figures around the world — exports, refinery figures and other measures — could not account for all the oil that Iraq says it is producing. The administration also took into account how much crude oil was consumed internally, to do things like fuel Iraqi power plants and refine into gasoline and other products. When all those uses of the oil were taken into consideration, Mr. Kreil said, Iraq’s stated production figures did not add up. “Either they’re producing less, or they’re producing what they say and the difference is completely unaccounted for in any of the places we think it should go,” Mr. Kreil said. “Either it’s overly optimistic, or it’s unaccounted for.” More Articles in International &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Skip to next paragraph After touring military sites, Mark Vahradian plans a fund-raiser. The inspector general is examining whether officials who run “America Supports You,” a three-year-old Pentagon program lauded by Defense Secretary , helped arrange a fund-raiser for a private foundation set up last December by former Bush administration appointees. The foundation raises money to help troops and their families. The inquiry is also looking into whether money used for “America Supports You” and other public outreach programs has been shifted improperly from Pentagon accounts intended for other purposes. Internal memorandums and e-mail messages provided to investigators, copies of which were shared with The Times, suggest that Pentagon officials encouraged Mark Vahradian, a Hollywood film producer, to make the private foundation, called the “America Supports You Fund,” the beneficiary of a Los Angeles fund-raiser he is planning for later this year. Pentagon employees are prohibited from soliciting on behalf of private organizations, said Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman. But Mr. Whitman said the Defense Department routinely referred members of the public to outside organizations, some of which are listed on a Pentagon Web site. Though legally separate from the department’s program, the foundation is in many ways a creation of the Pentagon. It was established shortly after the department, because of legal concerns, abandoned plans to set up its own entity to raise private donations that would be handed out to private groups involved in helping soldiers who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan and their families. Mr. Whitman said that the Pentagon had no evidence so far of wrongdoing by officials, and that the decision to ask for an inspector general’s inquiry was made out of an “abundance of caution” after complaints by employees to the department’s Office of the General Counsel. “If there is something that we are doing that is inappropriate, if there is something that we are doing that is illegal, if there is something that we are doing that gives the appearance of impropriety, we want to know about that because these are important programs,” Mr. Whitman said. The decision to open an inspector general’s inquiry came several days after The New York Times asked the Pentagon questions about the “America Supports You” effort after obtaining memorandums, and other documents from an employee critical of the Pentagon’s involvement. Mr. Vahradian, whose movie credits include “Annapolis” and “Transformers,” said in an interview that he had been invited to go on a department-financed trip last fall to Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait, where he and other civilians on the trip met with American troops and with commanders. Participants were also allowed to fire heavy machine guns at a firing range and to participate in mock raids against “insurgents,” at the Army’s Forward Operating Base Dagger in Kuwait. The private America Supports You Fund and the Pentagon program with a similar name share the same goal: to promote and encourage the work of grass-roots groups that help soldiers and their families with things like small care packages for deploying troops and renovating houses to accommodate soldiers who come home wounded. But some department officials also appear to have seen the new foundation as an important tool in their push to maintain public support for troops overseas, a task that they feared had become much tougher since the November election put the Democrats in control of Congress. “What we have learned is that the American people are beginning to fatigue, even in their support for the troops,” Allison Barber, a deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs said in a January 3 internal department memorandum announcing the creation of the private foundation. “I don’t think we have a minute to lose when it comes to maximizing support for our military, especially in the new political environment.” Ms. Barber also noted in the e-mailed memorandum that the Pentagon’s America Supports You effort was a “non-political” program.

Orthodoxy on Social Issues - New York Times Giuliani Takes On G.O.P. Orthodoxy on Social Issues Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 HOUSTON, May 11 — directly challenged Republican orthodoxy on Friday, asserting that his support for rights, gun control and gay rights should not disqualify him from winning the party’s presidential nomination. Skip to next paragraph Rudolph W. Giuliani picking up a child wearing an &#147;I Love NY&#148; T-shirt on Friday at Houston Baptist College. In a speech, Mr. Giuliani conceded that his views on social questions were out of line with those of many voters. Rudolph W. Giuliani: In His Own Words The latest political news from around the nation. needed to be tolerant of dissenting views on those issues if they wanted to retain the White House. In a forceful summation of the substantive and political case for his candidacy, delivered to a conservative audience at Houston Baptist College, Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, acknowledged that his views on social issues were out of line with those of many Republican primary voters. But he argued that there were even greater matters at stake in the election, starting with which party would better protect the nation from terrorism. Mr. Giuliani suggested that his record in New York, which included leading the city after the attacks of Sept. 11 and overseeing a decline in violent crime during his eight years in office, made him the most electable of the Republican candidates, no matter his stand on social issues like abortion. “If we don’t find a way of uniting around broad principles that will appeal to a large segment of this country, if we can’t figure that out, we are going to lose this election,” he said. The speech by Mr. Giuliani reflected a decision — other campaigns suggested “gamble” might be a better word — to address head-on a fundamental obstacle to his winning the nomination: his long history as a moderate Northeast Republican in a party increasingly dominated by Southern and Midwestern conservatives. As such, it loomed as a potentially important moment in the party’s efforts to decide how to compete against the Democrats in 2008 and what it should stand for in a post-Bush era. “The mere fact that I am standing here running for president of the United States with the views that I have, that are different in some respects on some of these issues, shows that we much more adequately represent the length and breadth and the opinions of America than the other party does,” Mr. Giuliani said. Since the late 1970s, national Republican candidates have increasingly taken conservative positions on social issues. In that sense, Mr. Giuliani is bucking what many members of his party consider to be a powerful trend and confronting what is often assumed to be a wall of opposition among Christian conservatives, among other constituencies that play influential roles in the nominating process. Both his leading opponents, Senator , the former governor of Massachusetts, oppose abortion rights. Mr. McCain regularly refers to his lifelong opposition to abortion rights. Mr. Romney also regularly talks about his opposition, though he is perhaps more politically constrained because he supported abortion rights through much of his political career in Massachusetts. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a group of conservative Christians, dismissed Mr. Giuliani’s speech in an e-mail message he sent to supporters Friday afternoon. “When people hear Rudy Giuliani speak about taxpayer-funded abortions, gay ‘rights’ and gun control, they don’t hear a choice, they hear an echo of ,” Mr. Perkins wrote. Mr. Giuliani’s speech came a week after he gave a convoluted answer to questions at a debate about his views on abortion rights, setting off criticism by conservative groups. On Friday, he offered a lengthy explanation of his views on abortion, saying that he personally opposed it but that government should not prohibit it. He acknowledged that the views differed from those of many in the audience. “Where people of good faith, people who are equally decent, equally moral and equally religious, when they come to different conclusions about this, about something so very very personal, I believe you have to respect their viewpoint,” he said. “You give them a level of choice here.” Mr. Giuliani asserted that his differences with his audience on gun control and gay rights were probably less sharp. He defended his advocacy for tough gun control measures while he was mayor of New York, but said that was central to his strategy to reduce crime in the city. He described himself as an advocate of a view of the Second Amendment that holds that it permits citizens to bear arms. Mr. Giuliani said he supported allowing gay men and lesbians to enter into domestic partnerships but opposed allowing them to marry. Marc Santora reported from Houston, and Adam Nagourney from Washington. More Articles in National &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Orthodoxy on Social Issues - New York Times Giuliani Takes On G.O.P. Orthodoxy on Social Issues Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 HOUSTON, May 11 — directly challenged Republican orthodoxy on Friday, asserting that his support for rights, gun control and gay rights should not disqualify him from winning the party’s presidential nomination. Skip to next paragraph Rudolph W. Giuliani picking up a child wearing an &#147;I Love NY&#148; T-shirt on Friday at Houston Baptist College. In a speech, Mr. Giuliani conceded that his views on social questions were out of line with those of many voters. Rudolph W. Giuliani: In His Own Words The latest political news from around the nation. needed to be tolerant of dissenting views on those issues if they wanted to retain the White House. In a forceful summation of the substantive and political case for his candidacy, delivered to a conservative audience at Houston Baptist College, Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, acknowledged that his views on social issues were out of line with those of many Republican primary voters. But he argued that there were even greater matters at stake in the election, starting with which party would better protect the nation from terrorism. Mr. Giuliani suggested that his record in New York, which included leading the city after the attacks of Sept. 11 and overseeing a decline in violent crime during his eight years in office, made him the most electable of the Republican candidates, no matter his stand on social issues like abortion. “If we don’t find a way of uniting around broad principles that will appeal to a large segment of this country, if we can’t figure that out, we are going to lose this election,” he said. The speech by Mr. Giuliani reflected a decision — other campaigns suggested “gamble” might be a better word — to address head-on a fundamental obstacle to his winning the nomination: his long history as a moderate Northeast Republican in a party increasingly dominated by Southern and Midwestern conservatives. As such, it loomed as a potentially important moment in the party’s efforts to decide how to compete against the Democrats in 2008 and what it should stand for in a post-Bush era. “The mere fact that I am standing here running for president of the United States with the views that I have, that are different in some respects on some of these issues, shows that we much more adequately represent the length and breadth and the opinions of America than the other party does,” Mr. Giuliani said. Since the late 1970s, national Republican candidates have increasingly taken conservative positions on social issues. In that sense, Mr. Giuliani is bucking what many members of his party consider to be a powerful trend and confronting what is often assumed to be a wall of opposition among Christian conservatives, among other constituencies that play influential roles in the nominating process. Both his leading opponents, Senator , the former governor of Massachusetts, oppose abortion rights. Mr. McCain regularly refers to his lifelong opposition to abortion rights. Mr. Romney also regularly talks about his opposition, though he is perhaps more politically constrained because he supported abortion rights through much of his political career in Massachusetts. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a group of conservative Christians, dismissed Mr. Giuliani’s speech in an e-mail message he sent to supporters Friday afternoon. “When people hear Rudy Giuliani speak about taxpayer-funded abortions, gay ‘rights’ and gun control, they don’t hear a choice, they hear an echo of ,” Mr. Perkins wrote. Mr. Giuliani’s speech came a week after he gave a convoluted answer to questions at a debate about his views on abortion rights, setting off criticism by conservative groups. On Friday, he offered a lengthy explanation of his views on abortion, saying that he personally opposed it but that government should not prohibit it. He acknowledged that the views differed from those of many in the audience. “Where people of good faith, people who are equally decent, equally moral and equally religious, when they come to different conclusions about this, about something so very very personal, I believe you have to respect their viewpoint,” he said. “You give them a level of choice here.” Mr. Giuliani asserted that his differences with his audience on gun control and gay rights were probably less sharp. He defended his advocacy for tough gun control measures while he was mayor of New York, but said that was central to his strategy to reduce crime in the city. He described himself as an advocate of a view of the Second Amendment that holds that it permits citizens to bear arms. Mr. Giuliani said he supported allowing gay men and lesbians to enter into domestic partnerships but opposed allowing them to marry.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/12/business/12money.html	A Contrarian on Retirement Says Wait - New York Times A Contrarian on Retirement Says Wait Erik Jacobs for The New York Times Laurence Kotlikoff, left, an economics professor at Boston University, is developing his own financial planning software. Dick Munroe, right, is a software engineer. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 Come retirement, it will finally be time to get back the money that has been extracted from your paycheck your entire working life. Skip to next paragraph It Pays to Hang In There Indeed, requesting your Social Security benefits might seem like the first order of business as soon as the going-away party is over. But you might be a lot better off waiting a bit longer, until age 66 or even 70 before tapping into the government retirement fund. Relying at first on other savings like individual retirement accounts or the 401(k) from work could raise your living standard in retirement as much as 10 percent, according to calculations made by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at This is unconventional advice as Mr. Kotlikoff is the first to acknowledge. But Mr. Kotlikoff, 56, who has been studying savings his entire career, thinks that much of what passes for financial advice is merely conventional wisdom. As noted here, he has annoyed the financial planning industry with his research that suggests that the calculators used to forecast retirement needs overstate the amount that must be saved. He also says that the elderly should be investing more heavily in equities rather than bonds, as most planners advise. “There is almost nothing that you can tell me about conventional financial advice that makes any sense,” he said. There are many skeptics. Margaret H. Smith, an assistant economics professor at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., and a financial planner, thinks that a decision about when to take Social Security should not be coupled with other retirement funds. “It all depends on how long you live,” she said. As with many planners, she thinks tax-advantaged accounts, like 401(k)s or Roth I.R.A.s should be left to accumulate as long as possible. “If they can afford to take it at a later date because they have other sources of income, that’s good, but the lion’s share of people need every penny they can get,” said Chad Terry, the director for retirement solutions at the , a financial services company based in Des Moines. But there are some compelling financial reasons to at least hear Mr. Kotlikoff out. The average retirement age is now 62, not 65. Indeed, only 27 percent of Americans retire at age 65 or later, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The early retirement might be a direct result of the early availability of the payments. But delaying retirement can make a big difference financially. The Fidelity Research Institute did a study ( ) last year showing how advantageous a delayed retirement is. It used an example of a 55-year-old making $75,000. Upon retirement at 62, he would get $15,888 in Social Security. If retirement was postponed until 66, the amount would rise to $21,768. A further delay to age 70 would yield an annual benefit of $29, 436. There is a similar effect for those who choose to stop working at 62, but don’t tap Social Security until later. Instead of payments of $15,888, the retiree who waits until 66 receives $21,181 a year in benefits and one who delays until 70 receives a $28,821 annual stipend, or 81 percent more, the Fidelity Research Institute said. There is no additional financial benefit to delaying past 70. So why don’t more people delay taking their Social Security? Some may not know how benefits accrue. It is also possible that they figure they will die in only a few years. If that is the case, grabbing benefits early makes sense, but study after study shows Americans tend to underestimate their longevity — one reason financial planners urge people to save more. A foreboding that Social Security will not be around may be another reason Americans act early. Research by Hugo A. Benítez-Silva, Debra Sabatini Dwyer and Warren C. Sanderson at the State University of New York at Stony Brook found that the fear among Americans that future benefits might not be there drives many retirees to take benefits as soon as they are available. Researchers at the RAND Corporation are studying this issue to find ways to encourage Americans to consider delaying retirement or deferring benefit payments. Mr. Kotlikoff points out that because Social Security accounts increase at the rate of 7 percent a year from age 62 to 66 and then at 8 percent a year until age 70, retirees get a better return there than they might get on the bonds inside their I.R.A.s. “That’s a safe real return of 7 percent or 8 percent,” he said. “You can’t get anything close to that in the market.” The tax implications of raiding Social Security first does not matter much for the wealthy, but for everyone else it might. Social Security income is tax- free for an individual with a total income of less than $25,000 ($32,000 for a couple filing jointly). As income rises, the share of benefits subject to tax rises to 50 percent and then 85 percent. Here is the troublesome part and it will sound familiar to anyone who has been hit with the federal alternative minimum tax on their income: the tax on Social Security benefits is not indexed for inflation. As with the alternative tax, an increasing number of people will be subject to the benefits tax and pay more to the government than they need to. “There are a lot of taxes on Social Security benefits, if you don’t do this correctly,” Mr. Kotlikoff said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/12/washington/12pentagon.html	Pentagon Opens Inquiry of Troop-Support Group - New York Times Pentagon Opens Inquiry of Troop-Support Group Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 11 — The Pentagon is looking into complaints that Defense Department officials charged with building public support for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan might have engaged in improper fund-raising and unauthorized spending, officials said Friday. Skip to next paragraph After touring military sites, Mark Vahradian plans a fund-raiser. The inspector general is examining whether officials who run “America Supports You,” a three-year-old Pentagon program lauded by Defense Secretary , helped arrange a fund-raiser for a private foundation set up last December by former Bush administration appointees. The foundation raises money to help troops and their families. The inquiry is also looking into whether money used for “America Supports You” and other public outreach programs has been shifted improperly from Pentagon accounts intended for other purposes. Internal memorandums and e-mail messages provided to investigators, copies of which were shared with The Times, suggest that Pentagon officials encouraged Mark Vahradian, a Hollywood film producer, to make the private foundation, called the “America Supports You Fund,” the beneficiary of a Los Angeles fund-raiser he is planning for later this year. Pentagon employees are prohibited from soliciting on behalf of private organizations, said Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman. But Mr. Whitman said the Defense Department routinely referred members of the public to outside organizations, some of which are listed on a Pentagon Web site. Though legally separate from the department’s program, the foundation is in many ways a creation of the Pentagon. It was established shortly after the department, because of legal concerns, abandoned plans to set up its own entity to raise private donations that would be handed out to private groups involved in helping soldiers who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan and their families. Mr. Whitman said that the Pentagon had no evidence so far of wrongdoing by officials, and that the decision to ask for an inspector general’s inquiry was made out of an “abundance of caution” after complaints by employees to the department’s Office of the General Counsel. “If there is something that we are doing that is inappropriate, if there is something that we are doing that is illegal, if there is something that we are doing that gives the appearance of impropriety, we want to know about that because these are important programs,” Mr. Whitman said. The decision to open an inspector general’s inquiry came several days after The New York Times asked the Pentagon questions about the “America Supports You” effort after obtaining memorandums, and other documents from an employee critical of the Pentagon’s involvement. Mr. Vahradian, whose movie credits include “Annapolis” and “Transformers,” said in an interview that he had been invited to go on a department-financed trip last fall to Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait, where he and other civilians on the trip met with American troops and with commanders. Participants were also allowed to fire heavy machine guns at a firing range and to participate in mock raids against “insurgents,” at the Army’s Forward Operating Base Dagger in Kuwait. The private America Supports You Fund and the Pentagon program with a similar name share the same goal: to promote and encourage the work of grass-roots groups that help soldiers and their families with things like small care packages for deploying troops and renovating houses to accommodate soldiers who come home wounded. But some department officials also appear to have seen the new foundation as an important tool in their push to maintain public support for troops overseas, a task that they feared had become much tougher since the November election put the Democrats in control of Congress. “What we have learned is that the American people are beginning to fatigue, even in their support for the troops,” Allison Barber, a deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs said in a January 3 internal department memorandum announcing the creation of the private foundation. “I don’t think we have a minute to lose when it comes to maximizing support for our military, especially in the new political environment.” Ms. Barber also noted in the e-mailed memorandum that the Pentagon’s America Supports You effort was a “non-political” program.

Dick Munroe, right, is a software engineer. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 Come retirement, it will finally be time to get back the money that has been extracted from your paycheck your entire working life. Skip to next paragraph It Pays to Hang In There Indeed, requesting your Social Security benefits might seem like the first order of business as soon as the going-away party is over. But you might be a lot better off waiting a bit longer, until age 66 or even 70 before tapping into the government retirement fund. Relying at first on other savings like individual retirement accounts or the 401(k) from work could raise your living standard in retirement as much as 10 percent, according to calculations made by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at This is unconventional advice as Mr. Kotlikoff is the first to acknowledge. But Mr. Kotlikoff, 56, who has been studying savings his entire career, thinks that much of what passes for financial advice is merely conventional wisdom. As noted here, he has annoyed the financial planning industry with his research that suggests that the calculators used to forecast retirement needs overstate the amount that must be saved. He also says that the elderly should be investing more heavily in equities rather than bonds, as most planners advise. “There is almost nothing that you can tell me about conventional financial advice that makes any sense,” he said. There are many skeptics. Margaret H. Smith, an assistant economics professor at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., and a financial planner, thinks that a decision about when to take Social Security should not be coupled with other retirement funds. “It all depends on how long you live,” she said. As with many planners, she thinks tax-advantaged accounts, like 401(k)s or Roth I.R.A.s should be left to accumulate as long as possible. “If they can afford to take it at a later date because they have other sources of income, that’s good, but the lion’s share of people need every penny they can get,” said Chad Terry, the director for retirement solutions at the , a financial services company based in Des Moines. But there are some compelling financial reasons to at least hear Mr. Kotlikoff out. The average retirement age is now 62, not 65. Indeed, only 27 percent of Americans retire at age 65 or later, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. The early retirement might be a direct result of the early availability of the payments. But delaying retirement can make a big difference financially. The Fidelity Research Institute did a study ( ) last year showing how advantageous a delayed retirement is. It used an example of a 55-year-old making $75,000. Upon retirement at 62, he would get $15,888 in Social Security. If retirement was postponed until 66, the amount would rise to $21,768. A further delay to age 70 would yield an annual benefit of $29, 436. There is a similar effect for those who choose to stop working at 62, but don’t tap Social Security until later. Instead of payments of $15,888, the retiree who waits until 66 receives $21,181 a year in benefits and one who delays until 70 receives a $28,821 annual stipend, or 81 percent more, the Fidelity Research Institute said. There is no additional financial benefit to delaying past 70. So why don’t more people delay taking their Social Security? Some may not know how benefits accrue. It is also possible that they figure they will die in only a few years. If that is the case, grabbing benefits early makes sense, but study after study shows Americans tend to underestimate their longevity — one reason financial planners urge people to save more. A foreboding that Social Security will not be around may be another reason Americans act early. Research by Hugo A. Benítez-Silva, Debra Sabatini Dwyer and Warren C. Sanderson at the State University of New York at Stony Brook found that the fear among Americans that future benefits might not be there drives many retirees to take benefits as soon as they are available. Researchers at the RAND Corporation are studying this issue to find ways to encourage Americans to consider delaying retirement or deferring benefit payments. Mr. Kotlikoff points out that because Social Security accounts increase at the rate of 7 percent a year from age 62 to 66 and then at 8 percent a year until age 70, retirees get a better return there than they might get on the bonds inside their I.R.A.s. “That’s a safe real return of 7 percent or 8 percent,” he said. “You can’t get anything close to that in the market.” The tax implications of raiding Social Security first does not matter much for the wealthy, but for everyone else it might. Social Security income is tax- free for an individual with a total income of less than $25,000 ($32,000 for a couple filing jointly). As income rises, the share of benefits subject to tax rises to 50 percent and then 85 percent. Here is the troublesome part and it will sound familiar to anyone who has been hit with the federal alternative minimum tax on their income: the tax on Social Security benefits is not indexed for inflation. As with the alternative tax, an increasing number of people will be subject to the benefits tax and pay more to the government than they need to. “There are a lot of taxes on Social Security benefits, if you don’t do this correctly,” Mr. Kotlikoff said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/12/nyregion/12father.html?ex=1336622400&en=3cea29be24ec5129&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss	A Father&#8217;s Pain and an Empty Pizzeria - New York Times A Father’s Pain and an Empty Pizzeria Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 COOKSTOWN, N.J., May 11 &#151; After the third death threat of the day, Muslim Tatar decided on Thursday to telephone a sign maker. He had an assistant dictate precisely how he wanted the big new banners to read: &#8220;Under New Management.&#8221; Not that Mr. Tatar was certain he would be able to sell his beloved and suddenly beleaguered pizzeria here, Super Mario&#8217;s. Not that he was even sure he wanted to. But he had to do something about the empty tables, the car honks, the nasty taunts. &#8220;Now, I am target,&#8221; Mr. Tatar said, standing in the deserted restaurant on Thursday afternoon. &#8220;How do I know some kid won&#8217;t come and. ...&#8221; Instead of finishing the sentence, he raised the thumb of his right hand and jabbed his forefinger, riddling the air with invisible bullets. Everything has changed for Mr. Tatar since the authorities arrested his 23-year-old son, Serdar, along with five others they described as radical Islamists, on charges of plotting to attack the Fort Dix military reservation, and said that Super Mario&#8217;s was where they obtained a map of the base. Federal prosecutors said there were no indications that the elder Mr. Tatar had any idea about the plot, and the father said he and his son had grown largely estranged in recent years as Serdar&#8217;s religious zealotry increased. For two days after the arrests, Mr. Tatar did not sleep, he said, as he at once worried about his son and questioned his innocence, all the while second-guessing himself as a parent. Asked on Thursday how he was coping, an anguished Mr. Tatar rubbed his eyes and ran his hands through his silver hair before saying: &#8220;You have kids? You put yourself in my shoes.&#8221; Mr. Tatar, 54, came to New Jersey from Ankara, Turkey, in 1992, and worked his way up from dishwasher. Five years ago he had saved enough to buy the restaurant, where four trophies for the military softball teams he has sponsored rest on a windowsill, and a sign by the cash register advertises free newborn kittens. Suddenly, he faces two nightmares. There is the possibility of losing his son to a life sentence in prison, and of seeing his livelihood vanish in blame for the terror plot &#151; blame that by all accounts appears to be misplaced. Since Tuesday, when prosecutors first outlined the case, much of the public attention has focused on the families of the other suspects, particularly of the three ethnic Albanian brothers and a brother-in-law based in Cherry Hill, N.J. But because Mr. Tatar lives and works within minutes of Fort Dix, he has more directly borne the public rage. He has heard passers-by yell expletives at him and watched regular customers sneer as they pass the store without stopping. He has worried about his wife, who was on vacation in Turkey when their son was arrested, and is being treated for what he described as a nervous breakdown upon hearing the news. He has spent much of the week shooing reporters away from the restaurant rather than serving burgers and calzones to customers as business has tapered off like a fading heartbeat: little, less, nothing. The past four days have been an arc of emotion. He has expressed skepticism about the government charges against his son. He has been confused about whom to trust.

He had an assistant dictate precisely how he wanted the big new banners to read: &#8220;Under New Management.&#8221; Not that Mr. Tatar was certain he would be able to sell his beloved and suddenly beleaguered pizzeria here, Super Mario&#8217;s. Not that he was even sure he wanted to. But he had to do something about the empty tables, the car honks, the nasty taunts. &#8220;Now, I am target,&#8221; Mr. Tatar said, standing in the deserted restaurant on Thursday afternoon. &#8220;How do I know some kid won&#8217;t come and. ...&#8221; Instead of finishing the sentence, he raised the thumb of his right hand and jabbed his forefinger, riddling the air with invisible bullets. Everything has changed for Mr. Tatar since the authorities arrested his 23-year-old son, Serdar, along with five others they described as radical Islamists, on charges of plotting to attack the Fort Dix military reservation, and said that Super Mario&#8217;s was where they obtained a map of the base. Federal prosecutors said there were no indications that the elder Mr. Tatar had any idea about the plot, and the father said he and his son had grown largely estranged in recent years as Serdar&#8217;s religious zealotry increased. For two days after the arrests, Mr. Tatar did not sleep, he said, as he at once worried about his son and questioned his innocence, all the while second-guessing himself as a parent. Asked on Thursday how he was coping, an anguished Mr. Tatar rubbed his eyes and ran his hands through his silver hair before saying: &#8220;You have kids? You put yourself in my shoes.&#8221; Mr. Tatar, 54, came to New Jersey from Ankara, Turkey, in 1992, and worked his way up from dishwasher. Five years ago he had saved enough to buy the restaurant, where four trophies for the military softball teams he has sponsored rest on a windowsill, and a sign by the cash register advertises free newborn kittens. Suddenly, he faces two nightmares. There is the possibility of losing his son to a life sentence in prison, and of seeing his livelihood vanish in blame for the terror plot &#151; blame that by all accounts appears to be misplaced. Since Tuesday, when prosecutors first outlined the case, much of the public attention has focused on the families of the other suspects, particularly of the three ethnic Albanian brothers and a brother-in-law based in Cherry Hill, N.J. But because Mr. Tatar lives and works within minutes of Fort Dix, he has more directly borne the public rage. He has heard passers-by yell expletives at him and watched regular customers sneer as they pass the store without stopping. He has worried about his wife, who was on vacation in Turkey when their son was arrested, and is being treated for what he described as a nervous breakdown upon hearing the news. He has spent much of the week shooing reporters away from the restaurant rather than serving burgers and calzones to customers as business has tapered off like a fading heartbeat: little, less, nothing. The past four days have been an arc of emotion. He has expressed skepticism about the government charges against his son. He has been confused about whom to trust. He has been angry &#151; at the anger directed his way. And in his worst moments, he has suffered bouts of abject despair. &#8220;Somebody shoot me now,&#8221; he said, sitting by the window of his empty restaurant during one particularly bleak period Thursday afternoon. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care about business. I don&#8217;t care about nothing. Come shoot me now.&#8221; Mr. Tatar&#8217;s story echoes the oft-repeated immigrant tale.

Ashton, a seasoned criminal prosecutor at the Department of Justice, learned from her boss that a promised promotion was no longer hers. Skip to next paragraph Monica Goodling is accused of partisan influence in Justice Department hirings and firings. “You have a Monica problem,” Ms. Ashton was told, according to several Justice Department officials. Referring to Monica M. Goodling, a 31-year-old, relatively inexperienced lawyer who had only recently arrived in the office, the boss added, “She believes you’re a Democrat and doesn’t feel you can be trusted.” Ms. Ashton’s ouster — she left the Executive Office for United States Attorneys for another Justice Department post two weeks later — was a critical early step in a plan that would later culminate in the ouster of nine Ms. Goodling would soon be quizzing applicants for civil service jobs at Justice Department headquarters with questions that several United States attorneys said were inappropriate, like who was their favorite president and Supreme Court justice. One department official said an applicant was even asked, “Have you ever cheated on your wife?” Ms. Goodling also moved to block the hiring of prosecutors with résumés that suggested they might be Democrats, even though they were seeking posts that were supposed to be nonpartisan, two department officials said. And she helped maintain lists of all the United States attorneys that graded their loyalty to the Bush administration, including work on past political campaigns, and noted if they were members of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group. By the time Ms. Goodling resigned in April — after her role in the firing of the prosecutors became public and she had been promoted to the role of White House liaison — she and other senior department officials had revamped personnel practices affecting employees from the top of the agency to the bottom. The people who spoke about Ms. Goodling’s role at the department, including eight current Justice Department lawyers and staff, did so only on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Several added that they found her activities objectionable and damaging to the integrity of the department. Ms. Goodling, who is under investigation by the department’s inspector general and ethics office, as well as Congress, has declined to testify before a House panel, citing her Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid making self-incriminating statements. Her lawyer, John M. Dowd, declined to comment on Friday. A judge in Federal District Court in Washington signed an order Friday to grant Ms. Goodling limited immunity, which will allow House investigators to compel her to answer questions. Justice Department officials declined to respond to questions about Ms. Goodling’s actions and refused to allow some agency employees to speak with a reporter about them. “Whether or not Ms. Goodling engaged in prohibited personnel practices is the subject of an ongoing investigation,” a written statement said. “Given the ongoing nature of the investigation, we are unable to comment on the allegations.” H. E. Cummins III, one of the fired prosecutors, said Justice Department officials should have recognized that Ms. Goodling’s strategy was flawed from the start. “She was inexperienced, way too naïve and a little overzealous,” said Mr. Cummins, from Arkansas. “She might have somehow figured that what she was doing was the right thing. But a more experienced person would understand you don’t help the party by trying to put political people in there. You put the best people you can find in there.” Ms. Goodling, now 33, arrived at the department at the start of the Bush administration after working as an opposition researcher for the during the 2000 presidential campaign. Her legal experience was limited; she had graduated in 1999 from Regent University School of Law, which was founded by . Deeply religious and politically conservative, Ms. Goodling seemed to believe that part of her job was to bring people with similar values into the Justice Department, several former colleagues said. She joined the department in the press office. Soon after, two lawyers said, Ms. Goodling complained that staff members in Puerto Rico had used rap music in a public service announcement intended to discourage gun crime. “That is just outrageous,” she told one department lawyer. “How could they use government money for an ad that featured rap music? That kind of music glorifies violence.” Ms. Goodling’s shift to the executive office, which oversees budgets, management and performance evaluations of United States attorneys, occurred as officials in the White House and Justice Department were considering replacing a number of the top prosecutors. The first lists of possible targets had already been drawn up. But while those lists were being refined, Ms. Goodling, who would become deputy director of the executive office, was quietly helping make other changes.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 There are days when Wilfredo Gonell fantasizes about not having to steer his dates to the dollar menu. Or when Michael Ferrari, who is 27, recalls his life before peanut butter and jelly sandwich lunches, and before he had to become a roommate with his mom. Skip to next paragraph Vincent Laforet for The New York Times Wilfredo Gonell, left, dismissed a group of police recruits after a day of classes at the Police Academy. At first, their annual salary is $25,100. Kerry O’Connor, 32, fondly remembers when she did not have to keep her thermostat set at 60 degrees in the dead of winter. And Joseph Torres yearns for that not-so-distant time when he did not have to make a half-pound pack of cold cuts last an entire week. All four are new recruits with the New York Police Department and are struggling with the reality of scraping by their first six months on annual salaries of $25,100, the city’s pay to officers in training since January 2006. Once officers graduate, their salary rises to $32,700. Mr. Gonell, Mr. Ferrari, Ms. O’Connor and Mr. Torres, along with several other recruits, said that they knew being a police officer would never make them rich, but that their desire to join the force outweighed the financial hardship. But now, four months into their training at the Police Academy, and with graduation less than two months away, several recruits said that they had greatly underestimated just how difficult it would be to make ends meet. have gone unpaid. Credit card debts have mushroomed. Parents have been tapped, repeatedly and exhaustively, for emergency funds, extra bedrooms and leftovers. “After my mom cooks for me, I spread it out,” said Mr. Gonell, 25, who lives in the Bronx. “Rice and chicken, rice and chicken. I’m going to fly out of here eventually, that’s how much chicken I eat.” The Police Department’s entry level salary is the lowest for police officers in the region, and so is its officers’ top base pay of $59,588 after five and a half years. Those wages are a result of past contract negotiations, and Mayor has suggested that the job’s perks and prestige outweigh its drawbacks. Still, police union officials say the wages are deterring would-be recruits and driving seasoned officers to higher paying jobs elsewhere. The department hired 1,346 recruits in January, about 1,000 short of its goal, and police officials say the relatively low pay is largely to blame. Critics have suggested that the academy has lowered its standards in an effort to fill its ranks — an assertion the department denies — but Mr. Torres said the pay keeps away those who are not truly dedicated. “You’re going to get cops who really want to be cops,” he said. Still, Mr. Torres, who is 24, said he found the transition to a $25,100 salary especially rocky. A Brooklynite by birth, Mr. Torres said he made several times as much when he was a police officer in Burbank, Calif. He longed to return home, though, and be a police officer in New York. He is living rent free with an aunt on Staten Island, while his girlfriend and her 5-year-old daughter stay with his parents in New Jersey. Even so, after making car payments and buying gas and groceries, Mr. Torres said there was little left. “There was a lot of careful planning,” he said. “But right now, surviving is impossible.” Ms. O’Connor, who attended law school at Notre Dame University and until recently worked as a paramedic in Queens, said she worked overtime during the final six months of her old job to save up money. Her girlfriend took an extra job to make the mortgage payments on their new house, while Ms. O’Connor picks up the utility bills. But, like many others in the academy, she found herself unprepared and unable to cover unexpected expenses. Recruits must spend hundreds of dollars for, among other things, uniforms, swimsuits and gym clothes. They must buy their own guns and the $150 safe to store them in. Their graduation uniform costs $500. Many take out loans just to cover the costs. “If I had to do it again, I don’t know if I could,” said Ms. O’Connor, whose credit card debt and other unpaid bills have crept past $4,000. The academy’s pay is especially challenging for single parents, like Gladys Diaz, 31, who lives with her 13-year-old daughter, Samantha, in the South Bronx. Ms. Diaz relies on Samantha’s father to pay for their daughter’s clothes and sneakers. She also set up a pickle jar in her apartment that she and her daughter are filling with extra coins and dollars for a dream vacation in Puerto Rico. Much like starving students, many recruits have said goodbye to luxuries for now, and arguably a few necessities, too. They rarely go out to eat or to the movies. They said they had canceled cable television — Mr. Gonell dug up an old set of rabbit ears — and a few said they pirated wireless Internet connections. “The luxury I wanted to keep was my cellphone,” said Kiesha Lawhorne, 25, a recruit who lives in the Bronx. “I made it through by the grace of God.” Inadvertently, many recruits have become environmentally friendly, washing clothes in cold water, because it costs less than hot, snapping off lights in empty rooms and walking longer distances instead of hopping into taxicabs or cars. “I have air-conditioners in the window, but I don’t think I can afford to run them in the summer,” said Matthew Caplan, 27, who is still paying off loans for his master’s degree in forensic psychology. Already, some recruits from the current class, which graduates in July, say they are planning to take tests for police departments in Nassau and Suffolk, where officers’ top pay exceeds $90,000, or for departments in other states. Others, though, said they planned to pledge their lives to the department, even Mr. Torres, cheap ham sandwiches and all. “I want to stay here forever,” he said. “I’m know I’m always going to be N.Y.P.D.” Next Article in New York Region (2 of 16) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

The department hired 1,346 recruits in January, about 1,000 short of its goal, and police officials say the relatively low pay is largely to blame. Critics have suggested that the academy has lowered its standards in an effort to fill its ranks — an assertion the department denies — but Mr. Torres said the pay keeps away those who are not truly dedicated. “You’re going to get cops who really want to be cops,” he said. Still, Mr. Torres, who is 24, said he found the transition to a $25,100 salary especially rocky. A Brooklynite by birth, Mr. Torres said he made several times as much when he was a police officer in Burbank, Calif. He longed to return home, though, and be a police officer in New York. He is living rent free with an aunt on Staten Island, while his girlfriend and her 5-year-old daughter stay with his parents in New Jersey. Even so, after making car payments and buying gas and groceries, Mr. Torres said there was little left. “There was a lot of careful planning,” he said. “But right now, surviving is impossible.” Ms. O’Connor, who attended law school at Notre Dame University and until recently worked as a paramedic in Queens, said she worked overtime during the final six months of her old job to save up money. Her girlfriend took an extra job to make the mortgage payments on their new house, while Ms. O’Connor picks up the utility bills. But, like many others in the academy, she found herself unprepared and unable to cover unexpected expenses. Recruits must spend hundreds of dollars for, among other things, uniforms, swimsuits and gym clothes. They must buy their own guns and the $150 safe to store them in. Their graduation uniform costs $500. Many take out loans just to cover the costs. “If I had to do it again, I don’t know if I could,” said Ms. O’Connor, whose credit card debt and other unpaid bills have crept past $4,000. The academy’s pay is especially challenging for single parents, like Gladys Diaz, 31, who lives with her 13-year-old daughter, Samantha, in the South Bronx. Ms. Diaz relies on Samantha’s father to pay for their daughter’s clothes and sneakers. She also set up a pickle jar in her apartment that she and her daughter are filling with extra coins and dollars for a dream vacation in Puerto Rico. Much like starving students, many recruits have said goodbye to luxuries for now, and arguably a few necessities, too. They rarely go out to eat or to the movies. They said they had canceled cable television — Mr. Gonell dug up an old set of rabbit ears — and a few said they pirated wireless Internet connections. “The luxury I wanted to keep was my cellphone,” said Kiesha Lawhorne, 25, a recruit who lives in the Bronx. “I made it through by the grace of God.” Inadvertently, many recruits have become environmentally friendly, washing clothes in cold water, because it costs less than hot, snapping off lights in empty rooms and walking longer distances instead of hopping into taxicabs or cars. “I have air-conditioners in the window, but I don’t think I can afford to run them in the summer,” said Matthew Caplan, 27, who is still paying off loans for his master’s degree in forensic psychology. Already, some recruits from the current class, which graduates in July, say they are planning to take tests for police departments in Nassau and Suffolk, where officers’ top pay exceeds $90,000, or for departments in other states. Others, though, said they planned to pledge their lives to the department, even Mr. Torres, cheap ham sandwiches and all. “I want to stay here forever,” he said. “I’m know I’m always going to be N.Y.P.D.” Next Article in New York Region (2 of 16) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Everything has changed for Mr. Tatar since the authorities arrested his 23-year-old son, Serdar, along with five others they described as radical Islamists, on charges of plotting to attack the Fort Dix military reservation, and said that Super Mario&#8217;s was where they obtained a map of the base. Federal prosecutors said there were no indications that the elder Mr. Tatar had any idea about the plot, and the father said he and his son had grown largely estranged in recent years as Serdar&#8217;s religious zealotry increased. For two days after the arrests, Mr. Tatar did not sleep, he said, as he at once worried about his son and questioned his innocence, all the while second-guessing himself as a parent.

He has heard passers-by yell expletives at him and watched regular customers sneer as they pass the store without stopping. He has worried about his wife, who was on vacation in Turkey when their son was arrested, and is being treated for what he described as a nervous breakdown upon hearing the news. He has spent much of the week shooing reporters away from the restaurant rather than serving burgers and calzones to customers as business has tapered off like a fading heartbeat: little, less, nothing.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/12/washington/12gitmo.html	U.S. Won&#8217;t Limit Detainees&#8217; Visits With Attorneys - New York Times U.S. Won&#8217;t Limit Detainees&#8217; Visits With Attorneys Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 The Justice Department yesterday withdrew one of its proposals to tighten restrictions on lawyers representing detainees at , but said it would continue to press a federal appeals court for other limitations on the lawyers. In a court filing yesterday morning, department lawyers said they were no longer asking the appeals court in Washington to limit the lawyers to three visits with detainees at the Guant&#225;namo naval base, where about 380 men are now held. A series of department proposals to curtail detainees&#8217; lawyers drew wide attention and was criticized by legal groups and in Congress, with opponents saying the Bush administration was denying detainees the most rudimentary tools to challenge their confinement. &#8220;After further consideration of this issue by the Department of Defense,&#8221; the tersely worded filing said, the government &#8220;is no longer seeking to incorporate a three-visit threshold for the number of counsel visits.&#8221; But the filing made clear that the administration would continue to seek other limitations on the lawyers. These would include requests to permit only one visit for a detainee to authorize a lawyer to handle his case; to screen mail sent by lawyers; and to allow government officials, on their own, to deny lawyers access to secret evidence used against detainees by military panels. The filing came days before arguments are scheduled in a case that has become one of the main battlegrounds in the legal struggle over the administration&#8217;s detention policies. In that case, eight detainees have challenged the findings that they are properly being held as enemy combatants. Arguments are scheduled for Tuesday in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The proposal that would have cut off lawyers&#8217; access to their clients had been controversial, partly because it came as many detainees were resisting cooperating with their lawyers, adding a new layer of complexity to the legal battle over Guant&#225;namo. Some critics said that yesterday&#8217;s government action was a strategic retreat on the proposal that had drawn the most fire, and that the remaining proposed restrictions would damage the relationships between lawyers and detainees. &#8220;This is window dressing,&#8221; said Vincent Warren, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, an advocacy group that has coordinated the detainees&#8217; lawyers. &#8220;The remaining restrictions &#151; which include monitoring attorney-client mail &#151; makes meaningful representation impossible,&#8221; Mr. Warren said. Barry M. Kamins, president of the New York City Bar Association and one of the most outspoken critics of the department proposals, said yesterday&#8217;s action would not win over lawyers&#8217; groups that had opposed the proposals. &#8220;The easing of this one rule barely begins to address the egregious violations of the attorney-client relationship,&#8221; Mr. Kamins said. But some supporters of the department&#8217;s proposal said critics had not paid adequate attention to the government&#8217;s accusations that the restrictions were necessary because the detainees&#8217; lawyers had caused unrest at Guant&#225;namo by providing the detainees information about terrorist attacks and other events. &#8220;There are real national security issues here,&#8221; said Gregory S. McNeal, a professor at the Dickinson School of Law who has been a consultant to war-crimes prosecutors at Guant&#225;namo. One new rule the Justice Department is still proposing would permit government officials to unilaterally deny the lawyers access to any secret evidence used by military panels to determine that their clients were enemy combatants, which would be a reversal of existing procedures. Another proposal declares that if officials conclude that detainees&#8217; lawyers violate any of the rules governing their actions, the government &#8220;may bar counsel from visiting the U.S. Naval Base at Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba&#8221; without any court authorization. Under the current practice, lawyers said, disputes have been addressed by a federal magistrate. Some critics of the administration said they saw the department&#8217;s decision as the most recent example of a pattern of withdrawing proposals that draw extensive criticism just before courts are called on to rule. In their original request for the new rules, the department&#8217;s lawyers had said commanders at Guant&#225;namo had called for the restrictions because of &#8220;intractable problems and threats to security at Guant&#225;namo&#8221; that they blamed on civilian lawyers for detainees. But in an interview reported in The Miami Herald last week, Rear Adm. Harry B. Harris, the commander at Guant&#225;namo, was quoted as saying that the officers had changed their view. Admiral Harris said that the remarks cited by the department had been made last summer after a riot and the suicides of three detainees, and that the circumstances were now less turbulent. Yesterday&#8217;s court filing included a two-page affidavit dated Thursday, in which Admiral Harris said that the detention facility &#8220;has re-evaluated its requirements to ensure that its procedures concerning attorney visitation and related matters are not more stringent than necessary.&#8221; He declined an interview request yesterday. A Pentagon spokesman, Cmdr. Jeffrey D. Gordon, said the remaining restrictions the government was seeking in court &#8220;remain warranted and appropriate in light of operations at Guant&#225;namo.&#8221; A spokesman for the department, Erik Ablin, said that in the court case &#8220;the position of the United States is driven by base security operational and resource concerns.&#8221; More Articles in Washington &#x00bb; Want to save this article?  Download the Times File Toolbar - get it now with TimesSelect.

Skip to next paragraph The Reach of War Go to Complete Coverage » Using an average of $50 a barrel, the report said the discrepancy was valued at $5 million to $15 million daily. The report does not give a final conclusion on what happened to the missing fraction of the roughly two million barrels pumped by Iraq each day, but the findings are sure to reinforce longstanding suspicions that smugglers, insurgents and corrupt officials control significant parts of the country’s oil industry. The report also covered alternative explanations for the billions of dollars worth of discrepancies, including the possibility that Iraq has been consistently overstating its oil production. Iraq and the State Department, which reports the numbers, have been under relentless pressure to show tangible progress in Iraq by raising production levels, which have languished well below the United States goal of three million barrels a day. Virtually the entire economy of Iraq is dependent on oil revenues. The draft report, expected to be released within the next week, was prepared by the United States with the help of government energy analysts, and was provided to The New York Times by a separate government office that received a review copy. The accountability office declined to provide a copy or to discuss the draft. Paul Anderson, a spokesman for the office, said only that “we don’t discuss draft reports.” But a State Department official who works on energy issues said that there were several possible explanations for the discrepancy, including the loss of oil through sabotage of pipelines and inaccurate reporting of production in southern Iraq, where engineers may not properly account for water that is pumped along with oil in the fields there. “It could also be theft,” the official said, with suspicion falling primarily on Shiite militias in the south. “Crude oil is not as lucrative in the region as refined products, but we’re not ruling that out either.” Iraqi and American officials have previously said that smuggling of refined products like gasoline and kerosene is probably costing Iraq billions of dollars a year in lost revenues. The smuggling of those products is particularly feared because officials believe that a large fraction of the proceeds go to insurgent groups. Crude oil is much more difficult to smuggle because it must be shipped to refineries and turned into the more valuable refined products before it can be sold on the market. The Shiite militia groups hold sway around the rich oil fields of southern Iraq, which dominate the country’s oil production, the State Department official said. For that reason, he said, the Shiite militias are more likely to be involved in theft there than the largely Sunni insurgents, who are believed to benefit mostly from smuggling refined products in the north. In the south, the official said, “There is not an issue of insurgency, per se, but it could be funding Shia factions, and that could very well be true.” “That would be a concern if they were using smuggling money to blow up American soldiers or kill Sunnis or do anything that could harm the unity of the country,” the official said. The report by the accountability office is the most comprehensive look yet at faltering American efforts to rebuild Iraq’s oil and electricity sectors. For the analysis of Iraq’s oil production, the accountability office called upon experts at the Energy Information Administration within the United States Department of Energy , which has long experience in analyzing oil production and exports worldwide. Erik Kreil, an oil expert at the information administration who is familiar with the analysis, said a review of industry figures around the world — exports, refinery figures and other measures — could not account for all the oil that Iraq says it is producing. The administration also took into account how much crude oil was consumed internally, to do things like fuel Iraqi power plants and refine into gasoline and other products. When all those uses of the oil were taken into consideration, Mr. Kreil said, Iraq’s stated production figures did not add up. “Either they’re producing less, or they’re producing what they say and the difference is completely unaccounted for in any of the places we think it should go,” Mr. Kreil said. “Either it’s overly optimistic, or it’s unaccounted for.” More Articles in International &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Orthodoxy on Social Issues Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 HOUSTON, May 11 — directly challenged Republican orthodoxy on Friday, asserting that his support for rights, gun control and gay rights should not disqualify him from winning the party’s presidential nomination. Skip to next paragraph Rudolph W. Giuliani picking up a child wearing an &#147;I Love NY&#148; T-shirt on Friday at Houston Baptist College. In a speech, Mr. Giuliani conceded that his views on social questions were out of line with those of many voters. Rudolph W. Giuliani: In His Own Words The latest political news from around the nation. needed to be tolerant of dissenting views on those issues if they wanted to retain the White House. In a forceful summation of the substantive and political case for his candidacy, delivered to a conservative audience at Houston Baptist College, Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, acknowledged that his views on social issues were out of line with those of many Republican primary voters. But he argued that there were even greater matters at stake in the election, starting with which party would better protect the nation from terrorism. Mr. Giuliani suggested that his record in New York, which included leading the city after the attacks of Sept. 11 and overseeing a decline in violent crime during his eight years in office, made him the most electable of the Republican candidates, no matter his stand on social issues like abortion. “If we don’t find a way of uniting around broad principles that will appeal to a large segment of this country, if we can’t figure that out, we are going to lose this election,” he said. The speech by Mr. Giuliani reflected a decision — other campaigns suggested “gamble” might be a better word — to address head-on a fundamental obstacle to his winning the nomination: his long history as a moderate Northeast Republican in a party increasingly dominated by Southern and Midwestern conservatives. As such, it loomed as a potentially important moment in the party’s efforts to decide how to compete against the Democrats in 2008 and what it should stand for in a post-Bush era. “The mere fact that I am standing here running for president of the United States with the views that I have, that are different in some respects on some of these issues, shows that we much more adequately represent the length and breadth and the opinions of America than the other party does,” Mr. Giuliani said. Since the late 1970s, national Republican candidates have increasingly taken conservative positions on social issues. In that sense, Mr. Giuliani is bucking what many members of his party consider to be a powerful trend and confronting what is often assumed to be a wall of opposition among Christian conservatives, among other constituencies that play influential roles in the nominating process. Both his leading opponents, Senator , the former governor of Massachusetts, oppose abortion rights. Mr. McCain regularly refers to his lifelong opposition to abortion rights. Mr. Romney also regularly talks about his opposition, though he is perhaps more politically constrained because he supported abortion rights through much of his political career in Massachusetts. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a group of conservative Christians, dismissed Mr. Giuliani’s speech in an e-mail message he sent to supporters Friday afternoon. “When people hear Rudy Giuliani speak about taxpayer-funded abortions, gay ‘rights’ and gun control, they don’t hear a choice, they hear an echo of ,” Mr. Perkins wrote. Mr. Giuliani’s speech came a week after he gave a convoluted answer to questions at a debate about his views on abortion rights, setting off criticism by conservative groups. On Friday, he offered a lengthy explanation of his views on abortion, saying that he personally opposed it but that government should not prohibit it. He acknowledged that the views differed from those of many in the audience. “Where people of good faith, people who are equally decent, equally moral and equally religious, when they come to different conclusions about this, about something so very very personal, I believe you have to respect their viewpoint,” he said. “You give them a level of choice here.” Mr. Giuliani asserted that his differences with his audience on gun control and gay rights were probably less sharp. He defended his advocacy for tough gun control measures while he was mayor of New York, but said that was central to his strategy to reduce crime in the city. He described himself as an advocate of a view of the Second Amendment that holds that it permits citizens to bear arms. Mr. Giuliani said he supported allowing gay men and lesbians to enter into domestic partnerships but opposed allowing them to marry.

On Friday, he offered a lengthy explanation of his views on abortion, saying that he personally opposed it but that government should not prohibit it. He acknowledged that the views differed from those of many in the audience. “Where people of good faith, people who are equally decent, equally moral and equally religious, when they come to different conclusions about this, about something so very very personal, I believe you have to respect their viewpoint,” he said. “You give them a level of choice here.” Mr. Giuliani asserted that his differences with his audience on gun control and gay rights were probably less sharp. He defended his advocacy for tough gun control measures while he was mayor of New York, but said that was central to his strategy to reduce crime in the city. He described himself as an advocate of a view of the Second Amendment that holds that it permits citizens to bear arms. Mr. Giuliani said he supported allowing gay men and lesbians to enter into domestic partnerships but opposed allowing them to marry.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 There are days when Wilfredo Gonell fantasizes about not having to steer his dates to the dollar menu. Or when Michael Ferrari, who is 27, recalls his life before peanut butter and jelly sandwich lunches, and before he had to become a roommate with his mom. Skip to next paragraph Vincent Laforet for The New York Times Wilfredo Gonell, left, dismissed a group of police recruits after a day of classes at the Police Academy. At first, their annual salary is $25,100. Kerry O’Connor, 32, fondly remembers when she did not have to keep her thermostat set at 60 degrees in the dead of winter. And Joseph Torres yearns for that not-so-distant time when he did not have to make a half-pound pack of cold cuts last an entire week. All four are new recruits with the New York Police Department and are struggling with the reality of scraping by their first six months on annual salaries of $25,100, the city’s pay to officers in training since January 2006. Once officers graduate, their salary rises to $32,700. Mr. Gonell, Mr. Ferrari, Ms. O’Connor and Mr. Torres, along with several other recruits, said that they knew being a police officer would never make them rich, but that their desire to join the force outweighed the financial hardship. But now, four months into their training at the Police Academy, and with graduation less than two months away, several recruits said that they had greatly underestimated just how difficult it would be to make ends meet. have gone unpaid. Credit card debts have mushroomed. Parents have been tapped, repeatedly and exhaustively, for emergency funds, extra bedrooms and leftovers. “After my mom cooks for me, I spread it out,” said Mr. Gonell, 25, who lives in the Bronx. “Rice and chicken, rice and chicken. I’m going to fly out of here eventually, that’s how much chicken I eat.” The Police Department’s entry level salary is the lowest for police officers in the region, and so is its officers’ top base pay of $59,588 after five and a half years. Those wages are a result of past contract negotiations, and Mayor has suggested that the job’s perks and prestige outweigh its drawbacks. Still, police union officials say the wages are deterring would-be recruits and driving seasoned officers to higher paying jobs elsewhere. The department hired 1,346 recruits in January, about 1,000 short of its goal, and police officials say the relatively low pay is largely to blame. Critics have suggested that the academy has lowered its standards in an effort to fill its ranks — an assertion the department denies — but Mr. Torres said the pay keeps away those who are not truly dedicated. “You’re going to get cops who really want to be cops,” he said. Still, Mr. Torres, who is 24, said he found the transition to a $25,100 salary especially rocky. A Brooklynite by birth, Mr. Torres said he made several times as much when he was a police officer in Burbank, Calif. He longed to return home, though, and be a police officer in New York. He is living rent free with an aunt on Staten Island, while his girlfriend and her 5-year-old daughter stay with his parents in New Jersey. Even so, after making car payments and buying gas and groceries, Mr. Torres said there was little left. “There was a lot of careful planning,” he said. “But right now, surviving is impossible.” Ms. O’Connor, who attended law school at Notre Dame University and until recently worked as a paramedic in Queens, said she worked overtime during the final six months of her old job to save up money. Her girlfriend took an extra job to make the mortgage payments on their new house, while Ms. O’Connor picks up the utility bills. But, like many others in the academy, she found herself unprepared and unable to cover unexpected expenses. Recruits must spend hundreds of dollars for, among other things, uniforms, swimsuits and gym clothes. They must buy their own guns and the $150 safe to store them in. Their graduation uniform costs $500. Many take out loans just to cover the costs. “If I had to do it again, I don’t know if I could,” said Ms. O’Connor, whose credit card debt and other unpaid bills have crept past $4,000. The academy’s pay is especially challenging for single parents, like Gladys Diaz, 31, who lives with her 13-year-old daughter, Samantha, in the South Bronx. Ms. Diaz relies on Samantha’s father to pay for their daughter’s clothes and sneakers. She also set up a pickle jar in her apartment that she and her daughter are filling with extra coins and dollars for a dream vacation in Puerto Rico. Much like starving students, many recruits have said goodbye to luxuries for now, and arguably a few necessities, too. They rarely go out to eat or to the movies. They said they had canceled cable television — Mr. Gonell dug up an old set of rabbit ears — and a few said they pirated wireless Internet connections. “The luxury I wanted to keep was my cellphone,” said Kiesha Lawhorne, 25, a recruit who lives in the Bronx. “I made it through by the grace of God.” Inadvertently, many recruits have become environmentally friendly, washing clothes in cold water, because it costs less than hot, snapping off lights in empty rooms and walking longer distances instead of hopping into taxicabs or cars. “I have air-conditioners in the window, but I don’t think I can afford to run them in the summer,” said Matthew Caplan, 27, who is still paying off loans for his master’s degree in forensic psychology. Already, some recruits from the current class, which graduates in July, say they are planning to take tests for police departments in Nassau and Suffolk, where officers’ top pay exceeds $90,000, or for departments in other states. Others, though, said they planned to pledge their lives to the department, even Mr. Torres, cheap ham sandwiches and all. “I want to stay here forever,” he said. “I’m know I’m always going to be N.Y.P.D.” Next Article in New York Region (2 of 16) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.
