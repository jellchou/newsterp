News OxyContin maker, execs guilty of deceit By SUE LINDSEY, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 5:05 AM ET ROANOKE, Va. - The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin and three of its current and former executives pleaded guilty Thursday to misleading the public about the drug's risk of addiction, a federal prosecutor and the company said. Purdue Pharma L.P., its president, top lawyer and former chief medical officer will pay $634.5 million in fines for claiming the drug was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications, U.S. Attorney John Brownlee said. The plea agreement settled a national case and came two days after the Stamford, Conn.-based company agreed to pay $19.5 million to 26 states and the District of Columbia to settle complaints that it encouraged physicians to overprescribe OxyContin. "With its OxyContin, Purdue unleashed a highly abusable, addictive, and potentially dangerous drug on an unsuspecting and unknowing public," Brownlee said. "For these misrepresentations and crimes, Purdue and its executives have been brought to justice." Purdue spokesman James Heins objected to any suggestion of ties between the plea agreement and the abuse of OxyContin. "We promoted the medicine only to health-care professionals, not to consumers," he said in a statement. Privately held Purdue learned from focus groups with physicians in 1995 that doctors were worried about the abuse potential of OxyContin. The company then gave false information to its sales representatives that the drug had less potential for addiction and abuse than other painkillers, the U.S. attorney said. Ken Jost of the Justice Department's Office of Consumer Litigation said this case should put pharmaceutical companies on notice that they won't be able to get away with breaking the law to make a profit. "The things that they plot in their boardrooms, the things that they do behind closed doors will not stay behind closed doors," Jost said. "We have the people, we have the resources. We'll take the time and we'll take the effort to find out what they did and how they did it." Purdue Pharma said it accepted responsibility for its employees' actions. "During the past six years, we have implemented changes to our internal training, compliance and monitoring systems that seek to assure that similar events do not occur again," the company said in a news release. OxyContin, a trade name for oxycodone, is a time-release painkiller that can be highly addictive. Designed to be swallowed whole and digested over 12 hours, the pills can produce a heroin-like high if crushed and then swallowed, snorted or injected. From 1996 to 2001, the number of oxycodone-related deaths nationwide increased fivefold while the annual number of OxyContin prescriptions increased nearly 20-fold, according to a report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2002, the DEA said the drug caused 146 deaths and contributed to another 318. The U.S. attorney said the guilty pleas were entered Thursday morning in U.S. District Court in Abingdon, about 135 miles southwest of Roanoke. In an unusual move, Brownlee said, company chief executive officer Michael Friedman, general counsel Howard Udell and former chief medical officer Paul Goldenheim each pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of misbranding the drug. Of the total fine, $34.5 million was levied on those three. The fines will be distributed to state and federal law enforcement agencies, the federal government, federal and state Medicaid programs, a Virginia prescription monitoring program and individuals who had sued the company. About $5 million will go toward a six-year company program to monitor compliance with the agreement. When he took office in 2001, Brownlee said, his office was handling a number of cases related to OxyContin abuse, including crimes by addicts seeking to support their habits and arrests of street dealers and even pharmacists and physicians. "But it always seemed, I think to me and to the investigators, that there was more," he told a news conference. Investigators from a number of state and federal agencies worked together on an investigation of Purdue Pharma and began to subpoena company records in 2002, Brownlee said. "From these millions of records, they picked out probably 300 to 500 documents and pieced together a case," he said. Food and Drug Administration Food and Drug Administration was part of the investigation. A spokesman for Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the agency had not acted on a citizen petition Blumenthal's office filed more than three years ago. The petition raised concerns about misbranding and called for stronger warnings and fuller disclosure about OxyContin's dangers. Kim Rice of the FDA told the news conference that over time the agency has mandated increasingly stronger warnings on labels about OxyContin's abuse potential. Purdue Pharma recruited high-profile help in 2002 as the nation's number of oxycodone-related deaths rose dramatically. It hired former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's firm, Giuliani Partners, to try to prevent smuggling and abuse of the drug. "Purdue has demonstrated its commitment to fighting this problem in launching practical and novel solutions including the provision of tamper-resistant prescription pads to over 10,000 physicians and implementing its highly acclaimed `Painfully Obvious' teen education program," Giuliani said at the time.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/ivory	Report: Illegal ivory imports on rise - Yahoo! News Report: Illegal ivory imports on rise Thu May 10, 3:58 PM ET LONDON - Chinese-run smuggling rings based in Africa are responsible for illegal ivory imports nearly doubling in the past decade, according to a report published Thursday. The Cambridge-based wildlife trade monitoring watchdog Traffic International appealed to the Chinese government to help control the problem. "It is imperative that China reaches out to the growing Chinese communities in Africa with a clear message that involvement in illegal ivory trade will not be tolerated," said Tom Milliken, director of Traffic's Africa program. Worldwide, there are an average of 92 ivory seizures a month &#151; or three per day, the report said. Thirty-two seizures of 1.1 tons or more of ivory were recorded between 1998 and 2006, up from 17 between 1989 and 1997, according to an analysis by the watchdog of international elephant product seizure records. Markets in China are driving the demand for illicit ivory, which arrives either directly or through Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Japan and Thailand are also important final destinations, and the Philippines is a key transit country. These seven countries and territories account for 62 percent of the ivory recovered in the 49 largest recorded seizure cases, the report said. The study identified the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Nigeria as major sources of illegal ivory. "With myriad conflict zones, Central Africa is currently hemorrhaging ivory, and these three countries are major conduits for trafficking illicit ivory from the region to international markets, particularly in Asia," Milliken said. Ivory trading threatens elephant populations by creating commercial incentives for poachers. The ivory is used mostly to make decorations or luxury items. "This demonstrates greater sophistication, organization and finance behind the illegal movement of ever larger volumes of ivory from Africa to Asia," said Susan Lieberman, director of the World Wildlife Fund's Global Species Program. "This is clearly a negative consequence of the ongoing globalization of African markets and economies." Traffic International monitors trade in endangered animals across Europe for the CITES Secretariat in Geneva. 2 car bombs at Baghdad bridges kill 12 Britain's Brown vows to learn from Iraq Pope canonizes first Brazilian saint Sept. 11 suspect loses appeal in Germany U.S. confirms Afghan civilian casualties Most Viewed - World Iran, North Korea seek to boost cooperation Koreas adopt military agreement Britain's Brown vows to learn from Iraq Pope canonizes first Brazilian saint 2 car bombs at Baghdad bridges kill 12 CNN - 40 minutes ago Radler can&#39;t be trusted, Greenspan says CBC.ca - 2 hours, 52 minutes ago Politics and the Pope ABC News - Fri May 11, 9:34 AM ET Blair endorses Brown as successor CBC.ca - Fri May 11, 9:28 AM ET Mothers Day Flowers: $20 Guaranteed Mother's Day delivery.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/iraq_fighting_for_baiyaa	Violence mars once calm oasis in Baghdad - Yahoo! News Violence mars once calm oasis in Baghdad By HAMZA HENDAWI, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 7:55 PM ET BAGHDAD - Three months into Baghdad's security crackdown, sectarian violence is back on the rise &#151; this time, in a mixed neighborhood that had previously been relatively calm while Sunni-Shiite strife tore apart other parts of the Iraqi capital. Baiyaa, a middle-class district in western Baghdad, has started to display the fears and flight that have already carved up much of the city, which has become a patchwork of separate Sunni and Shiite enclaves. Snipers have begun appearing in parts of Baiyaa. Many stores have closed, and both Shiite and Sunni families have fled the area in recent weeks. Last Sunday, a car bomb devastated a food market, killing 30 people. The rumblings in Baiyaa have ominous implications for the U.S.-led security plan. They show that previously calm areas are still vulnerable to violence despite the flood of U.S.-Iraqi forces onto Baghdad's streets since February. The development also points to a troubling numbers game for Washington: whether plans for an additional 30,000 troops are even enough to cover the city of 6 million people and surrounding areas. Baiyaa offers lessons in the challenges of deciding how to spread the forces. The neighborhood had been relatively calm and was not seen as a hotspot for the security plan, which seeks to restore order in Baghdad to give politicians room to compromise. In the early days of the security sweeps, American troops came into Baiyaa in large numbers and patrolled on foot, according to residents. But U.S. forces significantly scaled back by March and ventured only occasionally into Baiyaa, which is on the road leading to Baghdad's international airport. Security was left mostly in the hands of the Iraqi military, dominated by the country's Shiite majority. "Things began to be a little unsettled in Baiyaa about two months ago," said Haidar Ahmed, a 34-year-old Shiite businessman, who packed his wife and three children into a minivan last Sunday and moved to Karbala, 50 miles to the south. "But the last two weeks have been really bad," he said by telephone. "We had a three-day stretch last week when we could not leave our homes because of the fighting." The precise reasons for Baiyaa's troubles are not clear, but accusations are thick on both sides. Sunni politicians have accused the Shiite-dominated government of allowing Shiite militias to operate in Baiyaa and elsewhere. Members of three Shiite families that fled Baiyaa a few days ago claimed Sunni extremists had threatened them. Those residents of the neighborhood spoke by telephone on condition of anonymity because they fear reprisals by armed gangs. "There are not enough checkpoints," said Ahmed Kazim, a 34-year-old Baiyaa resident, blaming the May 6 market bombing on what he said were the lax searches by Iraqi soldiers of cars heading to the area. No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing &#151; one of the deadliest to hit Baiyaa since the war began four years ago &#151; but the blast may have been in retaliation for bombings and mortar barrages against Sunni parts of the neighborhood the week before. U.S. military spokesman Lt. Col. Scott Bleichwehl said security operations have been stepped up in the larger district that includes Baiyaa. The military has divided Baghdad into 10 districts, each with a permanent U.S.-Iraqi garrison, called a joint security station. The station for the Baiyaa district is in another neighborhood. Baiyaa, however, seemed ripe for trouble. Its dusty streets and low-slung houses borders areas where the Mahdi Army of anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr holds sway. Baiyaa has a Shiite majority but is also the main commercial center of the Sunni-dominated part of Baghdad on the west bank of the Tigris River. Baiyaa's Sunnis are mostly drawn from the Janabi clan dominant in areas south of Baghdad known as the "triangle of death" because of insurgent activity and attacks against Shiites. Baiyaa's Shiites have their roots in southern There's little sign of life in parts of the district these days. Mortar shells fired from a nearby Sunni area struck Shiite parts of Baiyaa on Monday, killing at least four people, residents said. The government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has struggled to respond, blaming the trouble in Baiyaa on al-Qaida and criminal gangs. Chief spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said those groups want to "create the impression" of a city torn by sectarian strife. One resident, who gave his name only as Abu Ahmed, or "Father of Ahmed," said violence flared after suspected Shiite militiamen assassinated a popular Sunni doctor last month. Another, who gave his name only as Abu Mohammed, or "Father of Mohammed," pointed to a raid last month by U.S. and Iraqi forces near a Shiite mosque that killed two militants. Much of the violence has been centered in the heavily Sunni northern part of Baiyaa &#151; possibly indicating a move by Shiite extremists to establish a corridor linking their neighborhoods and control access of roads to Baghdad's airport and Shiite holy cities in southern Iraq. The Sunni militants, on their part, are keen to check the growth of what is becoming a large swath of Shiite presence in the heart of their territory. "There is just not enough troops in Baiyaa to take charge of the situation," said Sunni lawmaker Nasir al-Ani. "We are in constant contact with the security forces to try and stop the violence." To reassure the public, the Iraqi commander of the Baghdad operation toured parts of Baiyaa on foot Monday &#151; wearing a helmet and body armor and surrounded by dozens of heavily armed soldiers. "Baiyaa has been calm for a long time," Maj. Gen. Abboud Qanbar told reporters "But the last five days have seen terrorists moving into the area to stir trouble."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/fired_prosecutors	Judge OKs immunity deal in firings probe - Yahoo! News Judge OKs immunity deal in firings probe By MATT APUZZO, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - A federal judge approved an immunity deal Friday allowing former Justice Department aide Monica Goodling to testify before Congress about the firing of eight federal prosecutors. Goodling, who served as the department's White House liaison, has refused to discuss the firings without a guarantee that she will not be prosecuted. Congress agreed to the deal, Justice Department investigators reluctantly agreed not to not oppose it and U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan gave it final approval Friday. "Monica Goodling may not refuse to testify," Hogan began his brief order, which said that Goodling could not be prosecuted for anything other than perjury in connection with her testimony. Lawmakers want to question Goodling as part of an inquiry into whether the Justice Department played politics with the hiring and firing of department officials. What began as an inquiry into whether U.S. attorneys were fired for political reasons has grown to include the role of the White House in the firings and whether the Justice Department officials misled Congress about them. Goodling's lawyer has said that, with an immunity deal, she would cooperate and testify honestly. Justice spokesman Dean Boyd confirmed earlier this month that the department's inspector general and Office of Professional Responsibility were investigating Goodling's role in hiring career attorneys &#151; an unusual responsibility for her to have had. Investigators are trying to determine whether Goodling "may have taken prohibited considerations into account during such review," Boyd told the AP. "Whether or not the allegation is true is currently the subject of the OIG/OPR investigation." Three government officials with knowledge of the investigation said Goodling appears to have sought information about party affiliation while vetting applicants for assistant U.S. attorneys' jobs. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.

News Justice probes student lender payments By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, AP Education Writer Thu May 10, 8:37 PM ET WASHINGTON - The Justice Department is reviewing an audit that found hundreds of millions of dollars have been improperly paid to a student loan company, House Education Committee Chairman George Miller ( Miller, D-Calif., made the review public during a hearing in which he pressed Education Secretary on her decision to ignore a recommendation by her department's inspector general, John Higgins, to recover an estimated $278 million. It's the IG's audit that Justice is reviewing. A Justice Department spokesman declined comment Thursday. Spellings defended her decision not to recover the improper payments to the lender, Nebraska-based Nelnet, saying it was prudent to simply extract a promise from Nelnet that it would halt the practice, avoiding a costly lawsuit. Some lawmakers were skeptical. "Do you not have confidence in your inspector general?" asked Rep. John Tierney ( ), D-Mass. "I'm extremely uncomfortable with this." Spellings also traded barbs with Miller over allegations that the department's oversight of the student loan industry has been lax. Miller said the department failed to do its job when it came to uncovering improper relationships between student lenders and colleges or student loan officials at those colleges. He pointed to a 2003 notice from Higgins' office urging the department to curb inducements made by lenders to colleges or their staffs. Miller said the department promised it would keep an eye on such activities, a response he called inadequate. Spellings countered that the department has done what it could under existing law. "We monitor these programs vigorously," she said. "Who is monitoring? Do they have blinders on?" Miller asked. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has been leading an investigation into the $85 billion-a-year student loan industry. He has found evidence that some colleges received a percentage of loan proceeds from lenders given preferred status by the schools and found college loan officers got gifts from lenders to encourage them to steer borrowers their way. Cuomo said Thursday he had reached a $3 million settlement with Student Loan Xpress, Inc. and its parent company CIT Group Inc. Student Loan Xpress also agreed to cooperate with the investigation into potentially improper stock transactions. Cuomo's investigation revealed that the former CEO of Student Loan Xpress, Fabrizio Balestri, sold or transferred securities to financial aid officers at several colleges and to Matteo Fontana, a senior Education Department official who was recently placed on leave due to the disclosure of his stock holdings. Cuomo previously reached similar agreements with Citibank, Sallie Mae, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Education Finance Partners. The congressional hearing came a day after the House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill that would ban gifts from lenders to schools and impose strict controls on schools that publish approved lender lists to guide students to certain loan companies. Spellings called the vote "an important first step in this process." But she also noted that she was pushing through new regulations to protect against conflicts of interest. She said proposed regulations would be completed this month and would include a requirement of at least three lenders on any school's preferred-lender list, together with an explanation of how and why they were chosen. The rules also will spell out what is allowed and what is prohibited with regard to inducements from lenders to schools, she said. Spellings said her department has oversight only for loans made through the federal student loan programs in which the government guarantees the loans. She said she has no authority over the growing private student loan industry, in which the government doesn't make or guarantee the loans. She announced at the hearing that she was convening the chairs of other federal agencies that deal with banking and lending issues to help her examine the problems in this sector of the student loan industry. California Rep. Buck McKeon, the top Republican on the House Education and Labor Committee, came to Spellings' defense, saying she couldn't be "expected to be the ethics police for the nation's colleges."

News Guitar innovator Les Paul returns home By EMILY FREDRIX, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 54 minutes ago WAUKESHA, Wis. - Guitar legend Les Paul enthralled a hometown crowd at a concert that raised more than $100,000 for an exhibit on his life. The 91-year-old Grammy winner hadn't played in Waukesha in decades. Even though he claimed earlier he's never nervous before going onstage, he said, "I was lying. I'm nervous tonight." Wearing a blue turtleneck and black slacks, Paul dazzled the crowd with his playing and with stories from his long career Thursday night. During his 90-minute concert, he joined his jazz trio in playing tunes such as "Tennessee Waltz," "Lady Is a Tramp" and "Embraceable You" as the crowd paid rapt attention. After "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," Paul got emotional, telling the crowd it was his mother's favorite song. "You have no idea what it means to be back here," he said. At one point, he jokingly accused his piano player of missing a note but added that he's missed his share, too. "All the time I've been playing the guitar, the notes I missed, I say I'm saving them for the next album," he cracked. Paul said at an earlier news conference that his trip was stirring up memories, including the motivation to invent the solid-body electric guitar in the 1940s. He recalled coming home from a gig after an audience member told him his guitar needed to be louder. "I went home and I said to my mother, `I've got a critic and the critic has something to say. It's up to me to do something about it. So I'll make an electric guitar,'" he said. The invention caught on and helped Paul and his wife at the time, Mary Ford, record a series of hit records in the 1950s. Guitar-maker Gibson began mass-producing the Les Paul model in 1952. Many rock musicians became famous playing on the model. "Thank God the younger generation latched onto it and said, `Look what we got here,'" he said. Tickets for Paul's performance ranged from $300 to $375. All 350 tickets were sold, with all the money going to the Waukesha County Historical Society & Museum, which is raising money for the Les Paul exhibit. In March, Paul donated $25,000 to the museum. Paul is also known for developing recording techniques such as close miking, multitracking and use of echo and delay. He's credited with introducing the first eight-track tape player in 1950s and building an early model synthesizer. He's often called the "Wizard of Waukesha," though he said he's not sure where it came from. "I didn't create it. I don't care ... but if the shoe fits," he said with a laugh. Paul, who lives in Mahwah, N.J., has donated many artifacts and memorabilia for the planned exhibit, a $3 million project expected to open in 2010. Paul didn't need much warm-up time Thursday.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/food_contamination	U.S. hatcheries got contaminated feed - Yahoo! News U.S. hatcheries got contaminated feed Thu May 10, 5:19 PM ET WASHINGTON - Fish feed made with a contaminated Chinese ingredient was distributed to about 120 fish hatcheries and farms, roughly split between the United States and Canada, officials said Thursday. U.S. officials said the risk to people from eating fish that ate the contaminated feed was very low. The feed, manufactured by Skretting Canada, used imported Chinese wheat flour, purchased from a second Canadian company, that was spiked with melamine and mislabeled as wheat gluten. Wheat gluten is a mix of two proteins obtained when wheat flour is washed to remove the starch. A second imported Chinese vegetable protein, sold as rice protein concentrate but also simply wheat flour, has been found to have been contaminated by melamine. The nitrogen-rich chemical typically is used to make plastics, but can skew tests to make ingredients like wheat flour appear more protein rich than they really are. Together, the two contaminated ingredients have led to the recall of more than 150 brands of cat and dog food. Scraps from those pet foods also were used to make some pig and chicken feed. Food and Drug Administration Food and Drug Administration said Skretting has 198 U.S. fish feed customers, although just 50 to 60 are likely to have received products made with the contaminated ingredient. Two of those customers apparently farm fish for human consumption, FDA officials said. The rest are fish hatcheries, including at least seven Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife facilities that use the feed as a starter diet for juvenile salmon and trout. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said Skretting supplied 57 fish hatcheries and farms in that country. The spiked wheat flour came from two Chinese firms. Neither remains in business, according to the FDA. A message left Thursday with Skretting Canada was not immediately returned.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/terror_privacy	Bush's privacy board not doing its job? - Yahoo! News Bush's privacy board not doing its job? By HOPE YEN, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 8:37 PM ET WASHINGTON - The leaders of the Sept. 11 commission say a White House privacy board is not protecting civil liberties because it refuses to investigate allegations of illegal detention at Guantanamo Bay. "We urge they revisit the definition of their mission to include issues relating to the treatment of detainees," former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said in a telephone interview Thursday. He and former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean sent a pointed letter to the board this week outlining their concerns. "If they continue to hold to their position, we don't think they're doing their job," Hamilton said. Mark Robbins, the board's executive director, said board members had received the letter and would respond. The board's next meeting is Wednesday. The five-member White House privacy board began its work in March 2006 after a recommendation by the Sept. 11 commission. Last month, the board put out a 49-page annual report to Congress where it spelled out its mission and preliminary findings. Some of those conclusions are questionable and need fuller explanation, the Sept. 11 commission leaders wrote after reading the report. They cited the board's assertion it had no power to review the Bush administration's plans to limit lawyers' access to nearly 400 detainees deemed as "enemy combatants" at Guantanamo Bay, as well as allegations of torture and coercive interrogation at the Cuba facility, because the incidents were not taking place on U.S. soil. The American Bar Association has criticized "arbitrary restrictions concerning the number of times and the ways that lawyers may confer with their clients in Guantanamo." The limits would threaten competent representation without at all advancing national security, according to the lawyers' group. "We cannot speak to an audience, foreign or domestic, on the question of civil liberties without the topic of Guantanamo coming up," Hamilton said. "To ignore those and say they are not within the mandate is a too restrictive reading." Also troubling was the board's conclusion that two of the administration's most controversial surveillance programs &#151; electronic eavesdropping and financial tracking &#151; do not violate citizens' civil liberties, the commission leaders said. Hamilton and Kean also said they want to know more about the board's efforts to review the 's use of national security letters. Earlier this year, a lengthy audit by the Justice Department's inspector general found that agents sometimes demanded personal data on people without official authorization. Both conservative and liberal civil liberties groups have urged the privacy board to aggressively review the administration's surveillance policies. They have questioned whether the board was sufficiently independent enough to stand up to the president if he were flouting the law. Bush appointed Republican Carol Dinkins, a Houston lawyer and former Reagan administration assistant attorney general, to head the board. A longtime friend of the Bush family, she was treasurer of Bush's first campaign for governor of Texas, and is a partner in the law firm of Vinson & Elkins, where Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was once a partner. The panel's other GOP members are vice chairman Alan Raul, a Washington lawyer, and former Solicitor General Theodore Olson. Commissioner Lanny Davis, a former Clinton White House counsel, is the lone Democrat. Former Ambassador Francis Taylor is an independent. On Thursday, Hamilton said he and Kean realized the job of the privacy board was difficult but that the protection of civil liberties required a "strong and robust voice." "We hope the questions are constructive in nature. We also want the board to know there are those of us who are looking carefully at their work," Hamilton said.

The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of samples per second taken to create the media object. It is expressed in thousands of samples per second (kHz). It is an optional attribute. is number of audio channels in the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of seconds the media object plays. It is an optional attribute. is the height of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared. If this element is not included, it assumes that no restrictions are necessary. It has one optional attribute. r (cz 1 lz 1 nz 1 oz 1 vz 1) is the URI that identifies the rating scheme.

If multiple thumbnails are included, and time coding is not at play, it is assumed that the images are in order of importance. It has 1 required attribute and 3 optional attributes. specifies the url of the thumbnail. It is a required attribute. specifies the height of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the width of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the time offset in relation to the media object. Typically this is used when creating multiple keyframes within a single video. The format for this attribute should be in the DSM-CC's Normal Play Time (NTP) as used in RTSP [ RFC 2326 3.6 Normal Play Time ]. It is an optional attribute. NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use.

Allows the inclusion of a text transcript, closed captioning, or lyrics of the media content. Many of these elements are permitted to provide a time series of text. In such cases, it is encouraged, but not required, that the elements be grouped by language and appear in time sequence order based on the time. Elements can have overlapping times.

All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module. A movie review with a trailer, using a Creative Commons license. My Movie Review Site Movie Title: Is this a good movie?

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/nasa_telescope_dc	Hubble telescope successor on target - Yahoo! News Hubble telescope successor on target Thu May 10, 4:36 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The James Webb ( ) Space Telescope, intended to peer deep into the cosmos from beyond the moon, is progressing well in development and is on track for a planned June 2013 launch, officials said on Thursday. Edward Weiler, head of NASA&#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center, said after cost overruns a couple of years ago, the project has met every technical, cost and schedule milestone for the past 20 months. The launch date already has slipped from 2011. The Webb telescope is envisioned as the first of a new generation of space observatories, set to orbit nearly a million miles from Earth to allow scientists to look further into the universe than ever before in five decades of space exploration. Scientists hope the new telescope can collect data on the early universe after the Big Bang, and on planets outside our solar system, including evidence of whether life might exist on them. and Northrop Grumman Corp., the defense contractor building the telescope, described its progress during an outdoor news conference on the National Mall. "We&#39;re making excellent progress in meeting all of our plans and commitments for a mid-2013 launch," said Martin Mohan, Northrop Grumman&#39;s program manager, adding that NASA has endorsed all 10 new technologies developed for the telescope. Standing in the shadow of a full-scale model of the telescope measuring 80 feet long, 40 feet (12 meters) wide and 40 feet tall, Mohan said, "There&#39;s engineering to do, but invention is done, more than six years ahead of launch." Weiler said the telescope will cost &#36;4.5 billion including development, deployment and operations through 10 years after launch. He said Hubble has cost between &#36;7 billion and &#36;8 billion, adding that the Webb project is far ahead of where Hubble was at a similar time in development in the 1980s. The Webb telescope will be more powerful and capable than the aging Hubble, which has greatly expanded the understanding of the cosmos since its launch in 1990. The Webb is due to be placed in a more distant orbit beyond the moon. The Webb telescope will be given a primary mirror whose surface is about six times the size of the one on Hubble. It will also have infrared-sensing cameras and spectrographs. The future of Hubble is in doubt because the space shuttle program is winding down in the coming years and the telescope needs manned maintenance missions to continue operations. The Webb will not be as serviceable by astronauts as the Hubble but is being designed so that a future spacecraft can dock with it to try to correct simple problems, Weiler said.

News Gene switch helps mice fix their own broken hearts Thu May 10, 4:37 PM ET CHICAGO (Reuters) - Researchers have figured out how to switch on a gene in adult mice that repaired their hearts after a heart attack, a finding that may one day help fix heart damage in humans. The team at Columbia University Medical Center in New York found that by genetically manipulating a gene associated with cell growth, adult mice were able to make new cells to replace those damaged in a heart attack. Heart cells in mice, and in humans, stop regenerating after birth. If the heart is damaged by a heart attack, it cannot create new cells to repair the damage and hearts become less efficient at pumping blood. "Heart cells don&#39;t divide at all in the mammal heart, and that&#39;s why we have so much mortality and morbidity," said Dr. Hina Chaudhry, whose study appears in the journal Circulation Research. Chaudhry and colleagues studied the gene cyclin A2, a gene that is active in embryos, but shut off in adult mammals. "We genetically engineered these mice to keep expressing this gene that becomes silent after birth," she said in a telephone interview. The researchers then induced a heart attack in the mice. At three months, the mice whose cyclin A2 genes had been switched on had 77 percent better heart function than the other mice. "The mice who did not carry the gene were progressing to heart failure and dying," she said. "We didn&#39;t lose any of the mice that carried the gene. They had much better survival." "We&#39;re the first study to show a sustained improvement in cardiac function by any kind of molecular or cellular manipulation," she said. Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in people older than 65, a condition that affects nearly 5 million Americans. Chaudhry said the approach needed to be tested in larger mammals and then in humans, something she believes is not too far off.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/securities_fraud	Couple pleads guilty to insider trading - Yahoo! News Couple pleads guilty to insider trading By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 11:57 PM ET NEW YORK - A married couple, both lawyers, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud Thursday in what was described as one of the biggest insider-trading operations since the 1980s, a $15 million scam that reached into some of the nation's top financial firms. Randi Collotta, 30, a former employee of Morgan Stanley and Co. in Manhattan, and her husband, Christopher Collotta, 34, who worked in private practice, were among 13 people who were criminally charged in the case. The couple received $9,000 in kickbacks for inside tips that generated more than $600,000 in illegal profits, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Fish said. In a plea deal with the government, Randi Collotta agreed not to appeal any sentence as long it's between one and 1 1/2 years in prison. Christopher Collotta vowed not appeal any sentence from 10 months to a year and four months in prison. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero set sentencing for Sept. 7. They remain free on $250,000 bail each. Randi Collotta, sobbing through much of the proceeding, said she agreed in September 2004 with her husband to provide inside information she obtained in her job at Morgan Stanley to a broker, Marc Jurman of Palm Beach Garden, Fla. Jurman pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy and securities fraud. He was also named in a Securities and Exchange Commission Securities and Exchange Commission complaint earlier this year. She said she told her husband about pending mergers and acquisitions between September 2004 and July 2005. "I knew my husband would share the information with Marc Jurman," she said. She added: "I understood my actions were wrong and I accept responsibility for what I did." Fish said Jurman shared that inside information with others, resulting in several hundred thousand dollars in illegal profits beyond $38,500 Jurman pocketed after trading securities based on what the Collotas had told him. After the plea, Randi Collotta declined to comment. Her lawyer, Kenneth Breen, said, "Randi Collotta accepted responsibility for what she did and today took a significant step in putting this behind her." Christopher Collotta, like his wife, said in court that he knew he acted illegally and accepted responsibility. He declined to comment outside court as well. His lawyer, Brian Rafferty, issued a statement outside court saying his client "deeply regrets his actions in participating in these offenses, and realizes that he will have to live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life." The government said the trading ring relied on insiders at Morgan Stanley and UBS Securities LLC to steal valuable secrets from the companies. It also alleged a Banc of America Securities LLC broker accepted kickbacks and that two former representatives of Bear Stearns & Co. obtained proprietary UBS information. The SEC has described the case as one of the most pervasive Wall Street insider trading rings since Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine engaged in notorious insider-trading schemes during the 1980s. According to prosecutors, Randi Collotta was an associate in Morgan Stanley's global compliance division during the conspiracy. When they announced the case in March, prosecutors and SEC officials said the defendants included registered representatives, compliance personnel and hedge fund portfolio managers who traded hundreds of tips over five years. U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said Wall Street professionals repeatedly traded on secrets revealed to them by insiders at UBS and Morgan Stanley. Stock upgrades and downgrades by UBS and impending corporate acquisitions involving Morgan Stanley clients were relayed before the news hit the market, authorities said. The SEC said ringleaders working the UBS side of the scheme went to great lengths to hide their actions through clandestine meetings, disposable cell phones and secret codes. At least three people have already pleaded guilty to charges in the case and await sentencing. Meanwhile, Jennifer Wang, who also worked at Morgan Stanley, and her husband, Ruben Chen, of Englishtown, N.J., were charged Thursday in an unrelated insider-trading case with conspiracy and securities fraud. Prosecutors said Wang made $600,000 on secrets she stole from Morgan Stanley while she was a vice president. She and Chen, a vice president at ING Investment Management Americas, resigned after investigations began. After a brief court appearance late Thursday, Wang and Chen were each released on $2 million bail. Chen is required to submit to electronic monitoring.

News Vote postponed on immigration bill By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - Agreeing to give a fitful set of bipartisan talks more time to yield an immigration deal, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( ) said Friday he would delay a vote on the issue until next Wednesday. The move postponed &#151; at least for a day &#151; what was shaping up as a partisan clash over immigration after weeks of negotiations between the White House and senators in both parties designed to strike a broad compromise. With that agreement still elusive, Reid is planning to force debate next week on an immigration measure that passed the Senate last year with wide Democratic backing but opposition by a majority of Republicans. GOP senators have promised to block that move, saying they will only accept a new bipartisan compromise. "Some of the senators feel that there's a breakthrough that could take place" in talks over the weekend and early next week, said Reid, D-Nev., adding that he would "reluctantly" postpone the test-vote, which he had set for Tuesday. He has now set the vote for next Wednesday. Sen. Mitch McConnell ( ), R-Ky., said the move would "give us the maximum opportunity to piece back together the bipartisan agreement that we thought we almost had a week or so ago." Talks are continuing on the possible deal, which would first secure the U.S.-Mexico border and implement an elaborate high-tech identification system for immigrant workers, and only then give millions of illegal immigrants a chance at legal status &#151; after waits as long as 13 more years. Many Democrats and Republicans are wary of such an agreement, which also would limit immigrants' ability to bring their families to the U.S. Democrats fear it will be rejected as too punitive by their liberal base, while Republicans are concerned about alienating conservatives by appearing to treat illegal immigrants too leniently. plans to use his Saturday weekly radio address to urge Congress to reshape immigration laws.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/iraq_carbombs_dc	U.S. troops kill 4 gunmen in raids on car bomb cells - Yahoo! News U.S. troops kill 4 gunmen in raids on car bomb cells Fri May 11, 6:52 AM ET BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S. troops killed four militants suspected of involvement in car bomb networks, including one believed to have links to senior al Qaeda in leaders, the U.S. military said on Friday. In a statement, the military said a series of raids against car bomb cells took place in and around Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul over the past two days. Nine militants were detained. The four were killed on Friday near Taji, north of Baghdad, the statement said. The militant with suspected links to al Qaeda was a car bomb cell leader, the military said. It said U.S. forces approached a building during the raid, when soldiers were fired upon by the four. Troops returned fire, killing them, it said. U.S. and Iraqi forces launched a security crackdown in Baghdad in February that has cut sectarian death squad killings. But car bombs mainly blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda still plague the city, killing and wounding scores each week. U.S. commanders say they are making it a priority to go after car bomb networks, while putting up tall concrete barriers around popular targets such as markets to minimize attacks. In an interview with Reuters this week, the commander of U.S. troops in Baghdad, Major-General Joseph Fil, said his forces were making headway. "Although we are still seeing car bombs, where they are being directed has changed significantly," he said. "The effect of the car bombs has been reduced hugely, they are not getting to markets anymore because they are not allowed. They are not getting to many of the neighborhoods that they used to go because they are just denied that opportunity." U.S. military officials say the number of car bombs in Baghdad has fallen by 41 percent during the three months of the security offensive compared to the same period before the plan. Hundreds flee S.

News Wildfire rages on US nature reserve off California coast Fri May 11, 6:59 AM ET LOS ANGELES (AFP) - A wildfire erupted on an island nature reserve off the California coast on Thursday, sending firefighters from the mainland scrambling into boats to tackle the blaze, officials said. The fire tore through more than 400 acres (161 hectares) of brush in a rugged area of Santa Catalina Island, with massive plumes of smoke visible more than 80 kilometers (50 miles) away in downtown Los Angeles. Firefighters were being shipped to the island on boats, while the US Navy was sending two hovercraft to carry five engines, officials said. Local media said the island&#39;s main town of Avalon was being partially evacuated as the flames bore down. Residents had been ordered to gather on the town&#39;s beach, fire captain Mike Brown said. Four Los Angeles County fire helicopters were on the scene, fire officials said, while an airplane from the Forestry Department was also deployed. Catalina, which has a population of just under 4,000, is a famed wildlife reserve which is popular with day-trippers from Los Angeles. The island is home to 15 species of plants and animals not found anywhere else in the world. The fire comes after a blaze devastated more than 325 hectares (800 acres) of Los Angeles&#39; historic Griffith Park earlier this week.

News PUT PRESSURE ON CHINA TO IMPROVE ITS FOOD SAFETY Thu May 10, 7:56 PM ET WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Several years ago, I was doing research on how different ancient cultures had looked at the cats they found among them. Many of those cultures -- the Egyptian, the Siamese, the Burmese, the Japanese and the Turkish -- considered cats to be royal and sacred creatures, representative of the deepest spiritual yearnings of their societies. But when it came to the Chinese vs. the Japanese, I was surprised at what I found. All through their history, the Japanese depicted their little bobtail cats in the most exquisite aesthetic terms; they graced great paintings and their statues sat on the altars of Buddhist temples. But how different the Chinese were, even then! For across the board, even while they used it as decoration on their vases, the Chinese saw the cat only in terms of "How many mice can it catch?" It was a utilitarian creature and, later, a target of cruel consumption. I could not help but think of this early warning about Chinese attitudes toward animals these last few weeks as the pet food scandal broke, with unregulated Chinese products poisoning innumerable American and Canadian cats and dogs. And when you have gone through a market, like the one I saw in Chungking, with pitiful dogs lining up to be slaughtered -- or you hear about the special "raccoon dogs," which are literally skinned alive for their pelts -- you can only come to the conclusion that we really must stop treating China as some civilized country with whom we want to continue to do "business as usual." The pet food scandal was revealed several weeks ago because of the sudden deaths of countless pets through liver poisoning; it was subsequently discovered that a number of Chinese firms were using a white, gypsum-like substance called melamine to provide cheap bulk to pet food -- bulk that approximated protein in examination but was instead also poisonous. But that was only the beginning. Now the poisoned Chinese food chain has reached out across the world well beyond the recall of 60 million (as of now) packages of pet food: catfish illegally contaminated with antibiotics; counterfeit glycerin that is named as the cause of at least 365 deaths in Panama; chickens that had to be destroyed because of tainted Chinese food; severe malnutrition in Chinese children from fake milk powder; soy sauce made from human hair; cuttlefish soaked in calligraphy ink to improve their color, and eels fed contraceptive pills to make them grow longer and slimmer. I recall, on the many times I've been to China, that I would occasionally ask exactly what it was that we were eating. I don't know now whether I'm glad or sorry that they often smiled oddly ambiguous smiles and seldom answered the question. Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the U.S., adds that the United States should be watching the fur issue. "The Chinese are trying to sell a lot of fur in the U.S.," he told me, "like trim for parkas. There are two big issues. They advertise it as faux fur but, in the cases we know about, it turned out to be the fur of domestic dogs. ... There are few limits on what they do in China. They badly need an internal animal welfare group. There have been internal outcries about the killing of dogs for food, and we surely protested. But theirs is a totally consumptive view of animals." We are, of course, talking about a huge market. China's agricultural exports to the United States surged to $2.26 billion last year, according to U.S. figures, which is more than 20 times the $133 million of 1980. The U.S. has a $232 billion trade deficit with China, and so has put itself in the position of an economic supplicant rather than a world power. The country's financial reserves are $1.2 trillion as of this writing, and growing at $1.2 billion a day. So what exactly can the United States, Europe and other affected countries do against a country whose lack of regulations and laissez-faire attitude toward food standards could be poisoning us all, pets and humans alike? Actually, plenty! Above all, China seeks a place in the world alongside the big, industrialized societies. We must tell China that it will not get that place until it begins to abide by the rules of the Big Boys. This can be done through innumerable international organizations, as well as tough private diplomacy. Individual consumers could stop buying Chinese porducts. Get the American Chamber of Commerce in China, which has acted shamelessly, not as America's trade representative in China but as China's lobby in America, off its duff. Write to it; embarrass it. Send pictures of poisoned pet dogs and cats and suggest, not kindly, that it start shaming the Chinese for their heartlessness. Support efforts by the budding young elite classes in China, who are now getting their own pets, to start a humane society. Shame them, too. Suggest to them that they study the cases of Singapore, where the once-disdained little "drain cats" have been bred into the beautiful "Singapura" breed, now the national cat of Singapore, or Turkey, where the Angoras and the Turkish Van cats are the national cats of that country. Meanwhile, work here to get family pets named officially as "members of the family." This started with Katrina, when FEMA and other rescuers left family pets to die, breaking the hearts of untold thousands. Because there was such an outcry, that will not happen again, but there is a major discussion now going on in the nation as to how much of a family member a beloved cat or dog is. Civil judgments increasingly acknowledge the emotional value of pets to humans, for instance, and cruelty to animals is a felony in 42 states. Were this trend even stronger, people who lost pets to Chinese negligence, corruption and greed would be in a far stronger position to bring legal action against the pet food companies and perhaps the Chinese parties themselves. Until then, when you go to China, enjoy the art and the physical beauty of the country, but look deeply into the eyes of the people and talk "pets." Don't give them a moment's peace. They don't deserve it.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/nuclear_treaty_dc	U.S. criticized at talks on troubled nuclear treaty - Yahoo! News U.S. criticized at talks on troubled nuclear treaty Thu May 10, 4:01 PM ET VIENNA (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday argued that &#39;s nuclear activities could harm developing nations&#39; access to peaceful atomic energy, but drew criticism for its own ties with nuclear-armed Washington and European allies said at a meeting to review the troubled nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that the right it gives members to peaceful atomic power could not be fulfilled without trust that the technology would not be diverted to covert bombmaking. "Confidence (underpinning) cooperation for a worldwide sharing of the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy can be eroded by noncompliance by states like Iran and North Korea," U.S. delegation chief Christopher Ford told the 130-nation assembly. Unless Pyongyang and Tehran were restrained, he said, it would be hard to free up transfers of civilian nuclear know-how to developing nations as the 37-year-old NPT envisages. North Korea bolted from the NPT in 2003 and test-exploded a nuclear device in 2006. Iran is under U.N. sanctions for refusing to halt uranium enrichment, which world powers suspect is meant to yield atom bombs, not electricity as Tehran says. North Korea&#39;s misuse of NPT membership to weaponise nuclear technology is undisputed. And Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions -- marked by evasions of U.N. watchdog investigations -- disturb many fellow members in the Non-Aligned Movement of developing states. But speakers from the NAM told the meeting that disrespect for the NPT was also being bred by U.S. military ties with Israel, widely assumed to have the Middle East&#39;s only nuclear arsenal and one of just three nations outside the treaty. Some non-nuclear-armed states also cited Washington&#39;s nuclear technology accord with India, which developed nuclear firepower in secret without penalty by shunning NPT membership. "We express serious concern over a continuing development whereby Israeli scientists are provided access to the nuclear facilities of one nuclear weapons state," said Indonesian envoy Triyono Wibowo, speaking for the 115-nation NAM. "Stability cannot be achieved in a (Middle East) region where massive imbalances in military capabilities are maintained ... with potentially negative implications for the reliability of the global non-proliferation regime." Ford denied Washington was helping any non-NPT country with a nuclear weapons program. He said the U.S.-India pact, which analysts see as a U.S. bid to cultivate a strategic ally against foes like Iran, would boost the NPT by requiring India to submit some of its nuclear plants to International Atomic Energy Agency International Atomic Energy Agency New Zealand and Norway suggested such deals could send the wrong message by appearing to reward nuclear proliferators. Disarmament campaigners at the meeting said the U.S.-India deal would violate the NPT by letting India devote more of its uranium to expanding production of plutonium for nuclear arms. The NPT binds members without nuclear arms not to acquire them, promises nuclear "have nots" access to the technology for modernization, and obliges the original five nuclear powers from the post-World War Two era to phase out their arsenals. The two-week NPT gathering, which ends on Friday, was stalled by Iran for six days over objections to the agenda for debate, which it feared would heap blame on it for treaty woes. On Thursday, Iran blasted Western efforts to brand it an NPT villain. It again vowed never to mothball uranium enrichment and, taking up a NAM grievance, accused Western powers of illegally withholding nuclear energy from developing nations. "Arbitrary, self-serving criteria about proliferation-proof and proliferation-prone technologies can and will only undermine the treaty," said Iranian delegate Reza Pourmand-Tehrani.

News Credit-score panacea failed to stop US mortgage crisis Thu May 10, 6:50 PM ET By Peter Henderson, Tim McLaughlin, Andy Sullivan and Al Yoon. LOS ANGELES, May 10 (Reuters) - The crisis that has swept the U.S. subprime mortgage industry may come down to a simple, three-digit number, multiplied by millions. Lenders in the midst of an unprecedented U.S. housing boom pared borrowing requirements to a minimum -- a single number, known as a "FICO score," that was supposed to reflect the borrower&#39;s ability to repay a mortgage. Traditional down-payment demands were dropped. Borrowers were taken at their word because checking a salary took too long. Proof of savings, housing history, a job -- sometimes these, too, fell by the wayside. Critics of the system argue scores are full of errors and dangerous to use alone. They also are easy to manipulate. A cottage industry has thrived helping prospective borrowers raise their scores without changing their underlying ability to repay a mortgage. "There are fundamental flaws in the system because people can manipulate characteristics to get the FICO score they would like to see," said Kevin Jackson, a strategist who follows mortgages at RBC Capital Markets in New York. The system can be played "to come up with the kind of mortgage for people who really couldn&#39;t afford a house." A credit score and a written, unchecked statement of income have often been enough to get a loan. That provided the fuel that kept the housing boom going as huge demand for homes met a seemingly endless and unchecked supply of money. "The combination killed the goose," said Bill Dallas, chief executive of Ownit Mortgage Solutions, a failed subprime lender headquartered in Agoura Hills, California. Subprimes are higher interest rate loans for lower-credit-quality individuals. Mortgage failures hit record highs at the end of last year and the housing industry is in crisis. Now, loans worth hundreds of billions of dollars could be in jeopardy. TRICKS OF THE TRADE The FICO scoring system takes its name from Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corp., the company that developed it in 1989. FICO scores have been used by credit-card companies, auto loan providers and mortgage lenders as part of a process to grant credit for billions in purchases. FICOs incorporate five types of information to calculate a score on a scale of 300 to 850. A score above 700 is strong, mid-600s is good for many, and 620 is clearly considered second-tier, or subprime. FICO has been embraced by the &#36;10 trillion U.S. mortgage industry as an objective, easy-to-use way to make the market more efficient and fair, and even after the demise of some two dozen lenders, it is the main lending criterion for many companies. "Now the banks don&#39;t want to hear letters of explanation. They just want to learn FICO scores," said broker Bob Moulton, president of Americana Mortgage Co. in Manhasset, New York. Lenders who focused too narrowly on FICO numbers often failed to see how the figure was being misused. "You can do a lot more than you should be able to do to a FICO score, a lot quicker," said Ownit Mortgage&#39;s Dallas, a real estate industry veteran. He said a FICO score can predict default but his company used scores as just one element in a complex set of factors used to approve loans. One problem with relying exclusively on credit scores is they are easily changed. Consultants are available to fix errors in credit reports and also offer tips to raise scores, undermining the system. For example, borrowing money to temporarily pay down debt can boost the score. Ironically, opening more credit card accounts can also increase their amount of available credit -- and sometimes can boost the score. Another common way to boost scores is to piggyback on a relative&#39;s good standing by getting added as an authorized user of their credit cards. That way, it appears the person has the same access to credit as the relative. Entrepreneurs are taking that idea a step further, making a business of buying and selling credit card accounts, or "tradelines." For &#36;1,500, addatradeline.com offers to connect a customer to another person&#39;s credit card with a &#36;15,000 limit and 10 years of payment history, creating the appearance of a solid borrower. "As long as there are banks out there that will score with tradelines, there will be a market for this," said Adam Wheeler, owner of the Orange County, Calif.-based addatradeline.com. Lenders bragged that credit scores were rising among borrowers in the midst of the housing boom. However, a rising level of delinquencies last year revealed growing problems with the system. The total of loan payments more than 60 days late by January had surged to record highs above 14 percent, up from near 6 percent in mid-2005, according to UBS Securities data. As more people joined the real estate industry, lenders won business with offers of more flexible loans, lower rates and faster turnarounds. Paperwork became the enemy of speed. Credit histories, part of the basis of a credit score, require some judgment and training to interpret, and decisions are subjective. Armed with FICOs, lenders gave questionable borrowers leeway, such as requiring less proof from self-employed professionals with no steady job or pay stub. The strong housing market, combined with the ability to resell almost any loan to investors, lulled lenders into a sense of complacency. Three large credit reporting companies -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- produce FICO scores based on their own refinements of the basic Fair Isaac system. BIG INCENTIVE FOR SMALL CHANGES Credit scores make a big difference and even small changes can mean real savings to consumers or much higher fees to lenders. A &#36;200,000 30-year fixed rate loan in California would cost a borrower with a 760 FICO &#36;1,182 per month, or &#36;364 less on each payment than for a borrower with a score below 620, according to myFICO.com, Fair Isaac&#39;s consumer-oriented Web site. Boosting scores has become a booming industry. Deborah Vasile, a Cape Coral, Florida, mortgage processor who went through a recent business bankruptcy, said her credit score rose more than 100 points after she paid about &#36;500 to Credit Repair Today of Tampa, Florida. Considering buying a new car and a home, Vasile said she heard the service could remove bankruptcies from records before the typical seven-year posting period expires. After several derogatory items were consolidated into a single strike against her, she&#39;s now house hunting. Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School, said she questions how an entire industry can be based on claims of quick fixes for a person&#39;s creditworthiness. "If credit repair can help someone alter a FICO score for people that can pay a fee, doesn&#39;t that say that a FICO score is not a very reliable indication of a person&#39;s financial status?" she said. HIGHER FICO, LOWER PAYMENT As the credit-scoring system grew larger, it became more prone to errors, critics say. Credit reporting companies process some 4.5 billion pieces of data every month, and some 79 percent of consumer credit reports contain errors, according to a 2004 report by the Federation of State Public Interest Research Groups. Congress in 1970 required that companies verify and correct incorrect information within 30 days, opening the door for a new industry of credit repair services that often hound credit bureaus to get information expunged. The credit rating companies question the tactics used by the credit repair firms that pressure them to change credit histories. Deborah Vasile said her credit repair service is on a fourth round of challenges on her behalf, attempting to remove the bankruptcy from her record. Carl Jensen, owner of Credit Repair Today, said his service pushes for deletion of "derogatory items" as allowed by consumer law. "Sometimes it&#39;s that repetition; it&#39;s just beating them down," Jensen said. Credit-repair companies have attracted plenty of criticism themselves, and shady businesses pop up all the time since there&#39;s little barrier to entry, Jensen said. Credit bureaus are also beginning to rule that signing up as an authorized user on someone else&#39;s credit account is not a legitimate practice, said Helayne Urban, a personal credit consultant in White Plains, New York. Experian no longer accepts such tradelines in its scoring, she said. Meanwhile, mortgage brokers, which launch some three-quarters of all subprime home loans, are finding new ways to boost scores in a short period of time. Ellie Mae, a private company that is the biggest provider of loan origination software for the country&#39;s 40,000 mortgage broker companies, plans to unveil the "Maximizer," a program that for &#36;25 spits out steps a customer can take to improve a credit score to a level that meets a lender&#39;s guidelines. In recent months, mortgage brokers have been clamoring for such tools as they struggle with tougher lending standards and a falling number of mortgages, said Mitch Freifeld, president of Branch Management Solutions in Clearwater, Florida. Mortgage originations will likely fall by 20 percent over three years to &#36;2.247 trillion in 2009, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, an industry group. Ideally, consumers would use suggestions from the Maximizer and credit consultants to improve their credit standing, and the higher scores would lead to more favorable loans. But Fitch Ratings suggests higher scores have become less relevant in predicting who will quit making payments. As evidence, they point out that the average FICO score on loans that defaulted within their first year was 615 last year, just 10 points less than on loans with current payments. The gap was a better indicator in 2003, when bad loans were scoring more than 30 points less than good ones, it said. In 2005, CreditSights, an independent credit research firm, said FICO scores have become an excuse to lead consumers into higher levels of indebtedness. Banks responded by displaying rising FICO scores as a panacea to calm concerns about future credit deterioration, the analysts said. The companies that issue the scores defend their products and say consumers only hurt themselves by omitting valid credit information. "It just means the consumer has an inflated credit-risk potential and may end up getting a loan they should not have had in the first place," said Stuart Pratt, president of the Consumer Data Industry Association in Washington, whose members include Fair Isaac and the three main credit reporters. Fair Isaac Chief Executive Mark Greene staunchly defends his system, but facing what he called an "emerging sense of hysteria" in March, he asked a deputy to remind lenders to use all available information in their loan decision-making. Some lenders may have lost faith in the system. In response to lenders&#39; demands, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion together developed a more predictive credit score model, according to Barrett Burns, who is chief executive of VantageScore Solutions, the collaborative effort to weed out inconsistencies between the companies. Lenders today might take a lesson from failed underwriters that may have ignored the details at their own peril. Executives from mortgage lender New Century Financial Corp. cited FICO scores to demonstrate the quality of their mortgage loan portfolio. On May 4, 2006, for example, New Century told investors and analysts its average FICO score was 633 at the end of the first quarter of 2006, up from 600 in 2003. "Credit performance is better than historical experience and has exceeded our expectations," the company&#39;s slide presentation said. Eleven months later, New Century filed for bankruptcy protection. Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire Iraq lobbies Congress for U.S. support Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usspacenasa	Hubble telescope&#39;s successor will peer at universe&#39;s birth - Yahoo! News Hubble telescope&#39;s successor will peer at universe&#39;s birth Fri May 11, 8:07 AM ET WASHINGTON (AFP) - Once unfurled in orbit in 2013, the world&#39;s biggest space telescope will have an eagle-eyed camera that scientists hope will lift the veil from the origins and mysteries of the universe. The US space agency unveiled in Washington on Thursday a full-scale model of the James Webb ( ) Space Telescope (JWST), a probe bejeweled with new technologies that will succeed the aging but invaluable Hubble telescope in 2013. Scientists hope the telescope, named after the man who ran from 1961 to 1968, will peer back to the first stars after the "Big Bang" and the formation of solar systems capable of hosting life. The telescope, a joint project of the US, European and Canadian space agencies, will be three times bigger than Hubble, with a hexagonal mirror 6.5 meters (21.3 feet) in diameter and five-layer sunshield the size of a tennis court. The probe being built by Northrop Grumman Corp. will incorporate 10 new technologies, including an infrared camera and a spectrometer kept at an extremely low temperature for optimum performance. The telescope is expected to have a 10-year lifespan. The model was put on display Thursday in front of Washington&#39;s National Air and Space Museum. Launched 17 years ago, Hubble revolutionized astronomy by peering deep into the universe, beaming back dazzling images free of the distortions from Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Orbiting 575 kilometers (360 miles) above Earth, the Hubble has enabled scientists to better measure the age and origins of the universe, observe distant supernovas, and identify and study bodies in and outside the solar system. While Hubble was able to peer back to one billion years after the Big Bang, officials said the new telescope, with mirrors that will capture six times more light than its predecessor, will look even further into the origins of the universe -- by seeing light emitted from even more distant objects that has taken hundreds of millions of years to travel this far. "Clearly we need a much bigger telescope to go back much further in time to see the very birth of the universe," Edward Weiler, director of NASA&#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center, told a news conference. Hubble, along with space telescopes Chandra and Spitzer, have shown that the universe is hiding many mysteries, but they are unable to solve them, said Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute near Washington. "We cannot penetrate the darkness of the time when the first galaxies were born," Mountain said. The current telescopes are also unable to provide answers about black holes and the enigmatic dark matter, he said. With its more powerful mirrors, the new telescope "for the first time will send images from that dark age, high resolution pictures," he said. The 4.5 billion dollar James Webb Space Telescope will be folded to fit inside a European Ariane V rocket in 2013 and will unfurl 1.5 million kilometers (0.93 million miles) from Earth. NASA plans to launch a space shuttle mission next year to upgrade and maintain Hubble in order to keep it operational through 2013. Without a repair mission, the telescope would shut down in 2009 or even earlier, dealing a blow to scientists who have relied on Hubble&#39;s images to better understand the universe. "Before Hubble humans could only imagine the universe," Mountain said. "Now they can see it."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/led_lighting	LEDs emerge to fight fluorescents - Yahoo! News LEDs emerge to fight fluorescents By PETER SVENSSON, AP Technology Writer Thu May 10, 11:42 PM ET NEW YORK - The light bulb, the symbol of bright ideas, doesn't look like such a great idea anymore, as lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad are talking about banning the century-old technology because of its contribution to global warming. But what comes next? Compact fluorescent bulbs are the only real alternative right now, but "bulbs" that use light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, are quickly emerging as a challenger. LEDs, which are small chips usually encased in a glass dome the size of a matchstick head, have been in use in electronics for decades to indicate, for example, whether a VCR is on or off. Those LEDs were usually red or green, but a scientific breakthrough in the 1990s paved the way for the production of LEDs that produce white light. Because they use less power than standard incandescent bulbs, white LEDs have become common in flashlights. Established players in the lighting industry and a host of startups are now grooming LEDs to take on the reigning champion of residential lighting, the familiar pear-shaped incandescent light bulb. The light bulb has been running out of friends recently. California and Canada have decided to ban the sale of incandescent bulbs by 2012. Australia is banning them in 2010. The is looking at banning production of the bulbs. A U.S. Senate committee is working on a proposal that would phase out the light bulb in 10 years. And in New Jersey, where the first practical incandescent bulb emerged from Thomas Edison's laboratory in 1879, a bill has been introduced to ban their use in government buildings. Governments are gunning for the light bulb because it's much less efficient than fluorescents, using about five times more energy to produce the same amount of light. Lighting consumes 22 percent of electricity produced in the U.S., according to the , and widespread use of LED lighting could cut consumption in half. By 2027, LED lighting could cut annual energy use by the equivalent of 500 million barrels of oil, with the attendant reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas believed to be responsible for global warming. Much of that reduction would be possible with today's technology, using compact fluorescents, or CFLs. But consumers haven't warmed to them. The light quality hasn't been satisfactory, most take time to turn on and aren't dimmable. The LED has advantages over the CFL in most of those areas, and judging by this week's Lightfair trade show in New York, it could be a serious challenge to the CFL in a few years. What holds it back is chiefly price, but LEDs are already an economic alternative for niche uses. In the last two years, the diodes have doubled in energy efficiency and brightness, according to Greg Merritt, director of marketing for Durham, N.C.-based LED-manufacturer Cree Inc. In particular, LEDs that produce a yellowish or "warm" light similar to incandescents have improved. Dallas-based Lighting Science Group Corp. showed an LED "bulb" that screws into a standard medium-sized socket and produces a warm light equivalent to that of a 25-watt incandescent bulb, but consumes just 5.8 watts. It costs $50, hardly palatable to consumers who can buy a standard bulb for less than a dollar. Polybrite International, a startup in Naperville, Ill., announced that lighting giant Osram Sylvania, a subsidiary of Germany's Siemens AG, will distribute its LED "bulbs." The intended market is mainly commercial clients, who can afford to pay $15 to $85 per unit, according to Osram Sylvania marketing manager Constance Pineault. The energy efficiency is no doubt a draw for commercial clients like hotels, but LEDs have another big advantage: they last up to 50,000 hours, according to manufacturers. That compares to about 10,000 hours for fluorescents and 1,000 hours for incandescents. Not having to send out janitors to replace burned-out bulbs means big savings in maintenance costs. "Right now the applications that make sense are either high maintenance or high power consumption, like parking garages, where the lights are on all the time," said Cree's Merritt. LEDs already beat fluorescents for energy efficiency in some niche uses. For instance, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is putting LED lighting in its in-store refrigerators, where the cold dims fluorescents and incandescents produce too much heat. LEDs also starting to replace flat fluorescent backlights in liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, where they produce better colors. LEDs don't contain toxic mercury, which CFLs do, though the amount is very small. (Recent stories circulating on the Web about calling a hazmat team if a CFL breaks are exaggerated. The U.S. recommends sweeping up, not vacuuming, the fragments, then checking out local recycling options.) The cost of LED lighting should be coming down quickly. Polybrite founder Carl Scianna said the cost of individual white-light diodes, several of which go into an LED bulb and make up much of the cost, have come down in price from about $8 to $1.50 in a year. "They're going to keep going down," Scianna said. "By the middle of next year, they'll be priced for consumers." Nadarajah Narendran, director of lighting research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., cautions that there are still technical issues to work out with LEDs. While single LEDs can demonstrate very high energy efficiency in the lab, when they're combined into fixtures, their efficiency is considerably lower. In part that's a heat issue: the diodes produce less heat than incandescents, but they keep that heat in the fixture rather than radiating it, and the hotter the diodes get, the less efficient they are. He sees screwing LED bulbs into standard sockets "as a waste of talent" that doesn't utilize the inherent properties of LEDs, like their small size and longevity. "You could build them in as part of the furniture, part of the cabinetry," Narendran said. Because of their high prices, he doesn't believe LEDs will be ready to replace incandescents in all their uses for the next five to 10 years, but "LEDs, good or bad, will be growing very rapidly."
