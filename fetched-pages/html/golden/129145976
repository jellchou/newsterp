News Men apologize for cartoon stunt By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer BOSTON - Two men who planted electronic devices in a botched television promotion that prompted a bomb scare apologized Friday and performed community service to resolve the criminal charges against them. Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28, said they never expected the stunt to cause any turmoil. "I deeply regret that this incident caused such anguish and disruption to so many people," Berdovsky told the Charlestown District Court. Stevens said he saw the devices simply as "harmless entertainment." "I had no intention of upsetting or alarming anyone," he said. The two were accused of planting about three dozen battery-powered devices in Boston and Cambridge on Jan. 31. The devices, a promotion for Cartoon Network, had lights that created images of a cartoon character making an obscene gesture. Fears of terrorism arose when the devices were discovered in a subway station and on a bridge, among other locations. Bomb squads were deployed, and highways, bridges and some transit stations were temporarily closed. Similar signs were placed in nine other cities around the United States, but only in Boston did they elicit such a response. Berdovsky and Stevens were charged with placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct. In exchange for the community service and public apology, prosecutors agreed not to pursue the criminal case. Berdovsky performed 80 hours of service and Stevens completed 60 hours at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston. Attorney General Martha Coakley said it would have been difficult to prove to a jury that the men intended to create panic, and that she did not believe they realized the problems the ads would cause. "We believe this was an appropriate and fair resolution," Coakley said. Berdovsky said he was relieved the case was resolved without a trial. "I am looking forward to what the future has to bring. I'm just going to be working really hard and working on my art and working to build a really peaceful community for all of us to live in," Berdovsky told The Associated Press by telephone after the hearing. At Spaulding, the men designed a cartoon mural that will be painted in a waiting area for children undergoing physical therapy, said Oz Mondejar, Spaulding's vice president of human resources. They also helped patients use computers, cleaned the hospital's sailing docks and helped produce a DVD featuring patients talking about their rehabilitation successes. The contrite apologies offered in court Friday were in contrast to their behavior at their first court appearance in January, when they mugged for the camera and waved to friends in the courtroom.

News Pistons take 3-0 series lead on Bulls Fri May 11, 8:00 AM ET CHICAGO - Tayshaun Prince scored 23 points and Chauncey Billups added 21, and the rallied from a 19-point deficit to beat the Bulls 81-74 on Thursday night in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Pistons, who swept Orlando in the first round, will try to wrap up this one Sunday at the United Center. "We love a challenge, man," Billups said. "We love any time we can get 20,000 fans against us and we can start hearing the crowd boo us and the hecklers. We just take that challenge, man, and we love those situations. We thrive on those situations." No NBA team has won a best-of-seven series after dropping the first three games, and only three major professional teams have done that: the 1942 The other Eastern Conference semifinal resumes Saturday at New Jersey with Cleveland leading 2-0. In the Western Conference semifinals, Utah, which leads 2-0, is at Golden State on Friday, and Phoenix is at San Antonio on Saturday in a series tied 1-1. After blowing out the Bulls in the first two games at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the Pistons trailed 44-28 at halftime. They were down 49-30 early in the third and 55-38 midway through the quarter, and they certainly were hearing it from a raucous crowd. But Prince, Billups and Wallace brought them back. Now, they're one win away from their fifth straight conference finals. "Perseverance &#151; that's the type of team that we are," Wallace said. "No matter what the deficit is, we feel that we can come back from it." Prince scored 13 points in the third quarter and Billups added 10. Wallace had a block in the closing seconds and hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to pull Detroit within 61-60. He then put the Pistons ahead with a jumper just under two minutes into the fourth period and added a 3-pointer that made it a five-point game midway through the quarter. Wallace had 16 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks for Detroit, and Richard Hamilton scored 16 points. Luol Deng led Chicago with 21 points, but was just 8-for-22 from the field. The Bulls were 28-of-83 (33.7 percent), almost the same percentage (33.6) they managed in the first two games, and again, they had no answer for the Pistons' zone. Detroit used it most of the second half, and the Bulls shot 10-of-41, including 4-for-25 in the fourth quarter. And while Bulls coach Scott Skiles again downplayed its effectiveness, saying his team was "getting shots all over the place," Wallace had another view. "That's just lying to themselves about things that we do," Wallace said. Chicago came up short at the free throw line as well, missing 10 in the game, seven of those in the fourth quarter. "We just lost on our homecourt, so this loss hurts a lot more than the other two, even though we played hard tonight and fought hard," Deng said. "I think we played better today than last two games, but it's still a loss and it still hurts." The Bulls outscored the Pistons 22-6 over the final 7:15 of the second quarter, turning a 22-22 tie into a 44-28 halftime lead. Detroit coach Flip Saunders showed his team clips of the first half during the break, and to Prince the problems were obvious. "We didn't have fun in the first half, the ball wasn't moving," he said. "We just talked about moving the basketball. ... Once we made the adjustments we were in good shape." With the score 55-38 midway through the third quarter, Detroit scored 12 straight points, eight by Prince. Ben Gordon scored 16 points for Chicago, but was 4-for-16 from the field, while Kirk Hinrich had 13 points. Ben Wallace showed up at the arena about 1 hour, 15 minutes before tipoff and finished with five points, 12 rebounds and two blocks. "It's the biggest loss of everybody's life because it's the last game," Gordon said. "We had a 19-point lead and they chipped away at it. It's tough to lose like that." Notes:@ Ben Wallace would not say why he was late, telling reporters: "I don't have to explain myself to nobody." Skiles, who was not thrilled about the late arrival, said: "Somebody said the traffic was really bad at that time. I mean it usually is in Chicago. I really haven't given it a lot of thought. That wasn't high on my list of priorities." ... Detroit shot 4-of-18 in the second quarter and 6-of-20 in the fourth. But the Pistons went 13-of-22 in the third.

News Iran, North Korea seek to boost cooperation 2 hours, 31 minutes ago have agreed to step up bilateral contacts, an Iranian news agency said on Friday, signaling closer ties between two countries which were part of U.S. President George W. Bush President George W. Bush &#39;s "axis of evil." Iran&#39;s Foreign Minister Manoucher Mottaki signed the agreement with visiting North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Yong-il on Thursday evening, the student news agency ISNA said. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#39;s government "is interested in expanding ties with North Korea in the political, economical and cultural fields," Mottaki was quoted as saying. "Therefore it is necessary to remove some barriers to provide and recognize new fields of cooperation," he said, suggesting North Korea&#39;s debt to Iran was one such barrier without giving details. Under Thursday&#39; accord, the foreign ministries of the two countries would every year send delegations to each other to "exchange ideas" over different international issues. Bush branded the two countries as well as as part of an "axis of evil" after he took office in 2001. Since then, Iran has defied Western pressure to suspend its nuclear program, which the West fears is aimed at making atom bombs, a charge Tehran denies. North Korea drew international condemnation when it conducted its first nuclear test in October, but agreed in February this year to shut its nuclear facilities in return for energy aid.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/ts_nm/pope_brazil_dc	Pope decries hedonism to Latin American faithful - Yahoo! News Pope decries hedonism to Latin American faithful By Philip Pullella and Todd Benson 1 hour, 25 minutes ago SAO PAULO (Reuters) - gave Brazil its first native-born saint on Friday and called on Roman Catholics to spurn media portrayals of life that glamorize pre-marital sex and undermine the traditional family. The Pope said a mass for hundreds of thousands of joyful, flower-waving faithful to canonize Friar Antonio Galvao, a Franciscan who lived in the 18th century and founded an order of nuns. "The world needs transparent lives, clear souls, pure minds that refuse to be perceived as mere objects of pleasure," he said in his sermon on a military airfield outside Brazil&#39;s largest city on the third day of his first visit to Latin America. "It is necessary to oppose those elements of the media that ridicule the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage," he said to applause from the crowd. Faithful flocked to the open-air mass from across Brazil, the world&#39;s largest Catholic country, and elsewhere in Latin America. Many camped out overnight in chilly weather although the crowd was smaller than the more than one million people organizers had expected. Pope Benedict&#39;s canonization of Friar Galvao was an important part of his mission on this trip to revitalize the Church in Latin America, home to nearly half the world&#39;s 1.1 billion Catholics. Brazilians hoping for a miracle often swallow so-called Friar Galvao Pills, tiny pieces of rice paper with prayers written on them. He is considered a guardian of women in labor and the has attributed two miracles to him -- the curing of a 4-year-old girl who was believed to have an incurable disease and the survival of a mother and child in a high-risk pregnancy. The mother, Sandra Grossi de Almeida, and her 7-year-old son Enzo went on the stage to hug the Pope during the canonization ceremony. Benedict praised Galvao for helping the poor and the sick, and for trying to be a peacemaker in his times. During his trip so far, the 80-year-old Pontiff has firmly reinforced the Church&#39;s opposition to abortion and called for a return to traditional family values. But in a country where sex outside marriage is common, birth control is widely used, and divorce is not frowned upon, his message has had a mixed reception. "This pope is a little too rigid, especially when it comes to issues like marriage," said Elisangela do Nascimento, 33-year-old divorced housewife from Sao Paulo in the crowd. The trip, his first to Latin America since he was elected two years ago, is also a test of the Pope&#39;s personal appeal as he tries to staunch the flow of followers away from the Catholic church to Protestant groups, a huge concern for the Vatican. A conservative theologian who has spent nearly 25 years of his life in the Vatican&#39;s corridors of power, some faithful have seen him as lacking the warmth and charisma that made his predecessor However, Vatican officials have insisted from the start of his Pontificate that Benedict is his own man and he appeared to be winning some hearts and minds. "We thought he was going to be a disappointment but he surprised us. People say he&#39;s authoritarian, but he&#39;s just a bit shy and sweet," said Lucilene Gutierres, a 21-year-old student, who spent the night at the airfield waiting to see him. Francisco Fortes, 60, said he was a direct descendent of Friar Galvao and lived in his hometown Guaratingueta. "This Pope has turned out to be a surprise. He seemed to be more reserved. But he&#39;s coming out of his shell here in Brazil," he said. The Pope will meet Brazilian bishops in Sao Paulo&#39;s Se Cathedral later on Friday and then travel to the holy shrine city of Aparecida, where he will deliver the opening address to a conference of Latin American and Caribbean bishops.

News Britain's Brown vows to learn from Iraq By D'ARCY DORAN, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 43 minutes ago LONDON - Gordon Brown launched his campaign to become Britain's next prime minister on Friday, pledging to learn from the mistakes of the war while honoring "our obligations to the Iraqi people." Brown, who faces no serious opposition after waiting more than a decade for his chance to lead the country, said there needed to be a stronger emphasis on political reconciliation and economic development in Iraq. "And obviously we've got to more to win the battle of hearts and minds against al-Qaida terrorism." , who announced he would resign June 27, officially endorsed Brown on Friday. As Treasury chief, Brown is credited with much of Britain's recent economic boom. "I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place," Brown said, pledging to win back voters disenchanted after a decade of Labour Party rule. The question is how much Brown will shift Britain's role in the Iraq war, which has divided Britain. He has indicated he wants Britain to devote more time and resources toward the creation of jobs and basic services for the Iraqi people, as the country slowly draws down its troops. Blair announced in February that his government &#151; the top U.S. ally in the Iraq war &#151; will reduce its troop level by 1,600 to about 5,500 by spring, but will retain a presence in southern Iraq until at least 2008. A total of 148 British soldiers have died since the 2003 invasion. But Brown has not mentioned specifics on his Iraq policy. He said he will make his first trip to Iraq in the coming weeks to inspect the situation firsthand. "I accept that mistakes have been made," Brown said. "We will keep our obligations to the Iraqi people. These are obligations that are part of U.N. resolution, they are in support of a democracy. I do think that over the next few months the emphasis will shift." "There are too many people in Iraq who don't have a stake in the economic future of the country, too many people unemployed, too many people who are not seeing services developed ... and therefore too many people who don't feel loyalty to the regime," he said. It also remains to be seen how close Brown and will be. Bush has called Brown a thinker and easy to talk to. Brown has been more reserved in his comments about the American president, whose alliance with Blair lost the Labour Party votes. Bush and Blair have had a close relationship, speaking regularly by phone and videoconference and getting together for talks at least twice a year since 2003. The White House announced Friday that Blair will visit Washington next week to meet with Bush. The two leaders will also will see each other in early June at the annual summit of industrialized nations, being held in Germany. said Brown was aware of the dangers surrounding failure in Iraq, and she didn't expect U.S.-Britain relations to change dramatically. "The bonds with Prime Minister Blair have been forged through some of the most difficult times, through the time of 9/11, through the time of the attacks on London, through and Iraq and Northern Ireland, and those are bonds of friendship that come from having been through some of the toughest circumstances," Rice told the British Broadcasting Corp. "But Britain and America will always be friends and I know that we will work very, very well with Gordon Brown when he becomes prime minister." Jack Straw, Britain's former foreign secretary, said Brown would respect the alliance with the United States. "Gordon Brown's affection and understanding of America goes back decades. And he takes the same view as Tony Blair does, which is that Britain's security fundamentally depends on the alliance with the United States and the union with Europe." The Iraq war severely dented Labor's popularity. Blair's close alliance with Bush was unpopular at home, there were mass marches in Britain opposing the U.S.-led invasion before it began, and the government's claims that was building an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction proved false. For more than a year, Labour has consistently trailed in opinion polls behind a Conservative Party revived by its new leader, David Cameron. In local and regional elections earlier this month, Labour lost hundreds of seats in city and county councils, and was beaten into second place in the Scottish Parliament elections by the Scottish National Party, which advocates independence.

News New domain names could come in mid-2008 By ANICK JESDANUN, AP Internet Writer Fri May 11, 8:16 AM ET NEW YORK - New Internet addresses for general use could start appearing in the summer of 2008 under a timeline the Internet's key oversight agency announced Thursday. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers invited public comment on procedures for creating new names, the first expansion for general use since 2000. Names added since then have been limited to specific regions or industries. "This is all about choice," Chief Executive Paul Twomey said in a statement. "We want the diversity of the world's people, geography and business to be able to be represented in the domain name system." Domain names are key for helping computers find Web sites and route e-mail. There are currently about 250 domain name suffixes, most of them for specific countries such as ".fr" for France. General-use names include ".com" and ".net." In 2000, two years after its designation by the U.S. government as the authority for overseeing Internet naming policies, ICANN approved seven new names, but only ".info" and ".biz" were truly for general use. ICANN solicited additional applications in 2004 and has approved six regional or industry-specific names, such as ".travel" and ".asia," while rejecting ".xxx" for the adult entertainment industry. Some ICANN critics have complained that the agency has been slow to approve new names and that the procedures have sometimes been arbitrary. Businesses and trademark owners, meanwhile, worry that more names will lead to more cybersquatting, the practice of grabbing names before companies can in hopes of selling them at a premium. ICANN did not specify how individuals and groups would be able to seek new names, but the group indicated that the procedures would be streamlined to permit "a much wider variety of them to be added in a timely, predictable and efficient manner." An ICANN committee, the Generic Names Supporting Organization, still is reviewing the procedures. Once it sends a recommendation to the ICANN board, procedures could be adopted by year's end and applications for new names could be accepted early next year. Twomey said new names could be reviewed and added into the system in the June-August 2008 timeframe. The new addresses are likely to be in English. ICANN could wrap up the technical work on non-Latin scripts by year's end, but it still must resolve policy questions such as who should decide what countries get what suffixes and how to make sure a domain in one language isn't inadvertently offensive in another.

News Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail By GEOFF MULVIHILL, Associated press Writer CAMDEN, N.J. - Six Muslim men suspected of plotting to massacre U.S. soldiers at Fort Dix were ordered held without bail Friday. Prosecutors argued that the men, all born outside the United States, pose a flight risk. They are being held at a federal detention center in Philadelphia. The men were arrested Monday night during what the said was an attempt to buy AK-47 machine guns, M-16s and other weapons. They targeted Fort Dix, a post 25 miles east of Philadelphia that is used primarily to train reservists, partly because one of them had delivered pizzas there and was familiar with the base, according to court filings. Their objective was to kill "as many American soldiers as possible," the documents said. The men have lived in and around Philadelphia for years, worshipped at moderate mosques and worked blue-collar jobs installing roofs, driving a cab, delivering pizzas and baking bread. Four are ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia, one is from Jordan and one is from Turkey. As they were led into the courtroom, each of the suspects smiled to relatives and friends, many of whom wept and blew kisses to them. Only one of the men, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, 22, asked to be released on bail, and friends and relatives offered to post properties they owned as collateral. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Stigall argued against letting Shnewer be released to the custody of his parents while awaiting trial. He said many of the illegal actions that the government alleges Shnewer committed happened or were planned at his parents' house. Defense lawyers for some of the men said they are considering attacking the prosecution's reliance on two paid informants who infiltrated the group more than a year ago and recorded conversations with the defendants. Authorities said they first learned about the men in January 2006 after a tip from a clerk at a Mount Laurel electronics store. The clerk called police because a home video the men wanted transferred to a DVD looked like it might have terrorist links, U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie said. Earlier this year, authorities said, the men took a training trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where they fired weapons and played paintball to prepare for an attack. Five of the men &#151; Shnewer; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan "Anthony" or "Tony" Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir "Elvis" Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. Abdullahu, who faces the least serious charges of the six, will have another bail hearing next Thursday.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_bi_go_ec_fi/economy	Overall inflation eases; gas prices up - Yahoo! News Overall inflation eases; gas prices up By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer 2 hours, 9 minutes ago WASHINGTON - Inflation at the wholesale level eased slightly in April even though gasoline prices surged for a third straight month. Wholesale prices rose 0.7 percent last month, down slightly from a 1 percent jump in March, the Labor Department reported Friday. The big force driving the increase was an 8.2 percent jump in gasoline prices, which followed increases of 8.7 percent and 5.3 percent in the two previous months. But outside of the volatile energy and food sectors, prices were unchanged last month, the second straight reading of zero for the closely watched core inflation index. In other economic news, the reported that retail sales fell by 0.2 percent in April while inventories held by businesses on shelves and backlots fell 0.1 percent in March, the biggest decline in inventories in nearly two years. The drop in sales served to underscore the tough environment for retailers last month as they battled a slumping housing market and rising gasoline prices, which left Americans with less to spend on other products. The nation's retailers had reported disappointing April sales in a survey released Thursday. The 0.1 percent fall in business inventories was the largest fall since a 0.3 percent decline in July 2005 and reflected a big 0.7 percent drop in stockpiles held by retailers. The cutback came as retailers tried to get control of their stockpile in the face of a slowing economy. The 0.7 percent increase in the , which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was in line with expectations. The zero reading for the PPI excluding food and energy was better than expected, providing welcome news for officials at the The Fed on Wednesday signaled that it continued to be more worried about the threat of inflation than the year-long slowdown in economic growth. However, other economists believe the economy could be vulnerable to a possible recession, especially if the troubles in the housing sector deepen and the recent spike in gasoline prices triggers a cutback in consumer spending on other items. Gasoline prices have surged to a record nationwide average of $3.07 per gallon, nearly 20 cents higher than two weeks earlier, according to the latest Lundberg Survey. That surpassed the old record of a nationwide average of $3.03 per gallon set last August. Food prices, which had been surging, rose a more moderate 0.4 percent in April as big increases for vegetables, beef and chicken products were offset by declines for eggs and fruit. Energy prices rose by 3.4 percent, led by the 8.2 percent increase in gasoline but also reflected a 8.7 percent jump in liquefied petroleum gas and a 4.8 percent jump in home heating oil. Outside of food and energy, the unchanged performance of core inflation reflected a decline of 1 percent for new cars and a 0.5 percent drop in the category that includes sport utility vehicles.

News Attacks planned for U.S. targets in Germany: media WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. and German officials say they believed terrorists were planning an attack on U.S. military personnel or tourists in Germany, ABC News reported on its Web site on Friday. "The information behind the threat is very real," a senior U.S. official told ABC News. German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told ABC: "The danger level is high. We are part of the global threat by Islamist terrorism." U.S. air marshals are providing additional protection of flights between Germany and the United States, law enforcement officials told ABCNews.com. The report, quoting U.S. and German law enforcement officials, said Patch Barracks, headquarters to the U.S. military&#39;s European Command, could be a target following reports that suspected terrorists had conducted surveillance at the facility.

The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images.

Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media.

It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of samples per second taken to create the media object. It is expressed in thousands of samples per second (kHz). It is an optional attribute. is number of audio channels in the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of seconds the media object plays. It is an optional attribute. is the height of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared.

It is an optional attribute. specifies the width of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the time offset in relation to the media object. Typically this is used when creating multiple keyframes within a single video. The format for this attribute should be in the DSM-CC's Normal Play Time (NTP) as used in RTSP [ RFC 2326 3.6 Normal Play Time ]. It is an optional attribute. NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use.

It has 2 optional attributes. role specifies the role the entity played. Must be lowercase. It is an optional attribute. is the URI that identifies the role scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is 'urn:ebu'.

It has 1 optional attribute. is the url for a terms of use page or additional copyright information. If the media is operating under a Creative Commons license, the Creative Commons module should be used instead. It is an optional attribute. Allows the inclusion of a text transcript, closed captioning, or lyrics of the media content. Many of these elements are permitted to provide a time series of text. In such cases, it is encouraged, but not required, that the elements be grouped by language and appear in time sequence order based on the time. Elements can have overlapping times. It has 4 optional attributes. Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated.

News NASA study: Eastern U.S. to get hotter By SETH BORENSTEIN, AP Science Writer Fri May 11, 7:53 AM ET WASHINGTON - Future eastern United States summers look much hotter than originally predicted with daily highs about 10 degrees warmer than in recent years by the mid-2080s, a new Previous and widely used global warming computer estimates predict too many rainy days, the study says. Because drier weather is hotter, they underestimate how warm it will be east of the Mississippi River, said atmospheric scientists Barry Lynn and Leonard Druyan of Columbia University and NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. "Unless we take some strong action to curtail carbon dioxide emissions, it's going to get a lot hotter," said Lynn, now a scientist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "It's going to be a lot more dangerous for people who are not in the best of health." The study got mixed reviews from other climate scientists, in part because the eastern United States has recently been wetter and cooler than forecast. Instead of daily summer highs in the 1990s that averaged in the low to mid 80s Fahrenheit, the eastern United States is in for daily summer highs regularly in the low to mid 90s, the study found. The study only looked at the eastern United States because that was the focus of the funding by the U.S. And that's just the eastern United States as a whole. For individual cities, the future looks even hotter. In the 2080s, the average summer high will probably be 102 degrees in Jacksonville, 100 degrees in Memphis, 96 degrees in Atlanta, and 91 degrees in Chicago and Washington, according to the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Climate. But every now and then a summer will be drier than normal and that means even hotter days, Lynn said. So when Lynn's computer models spit out simulated results for July 2085 the forecasted temperatures sizzled past uncomfortable into painful. The study showed a map where the average high in the southeast neared 115 and pushed 100 in the northeast. Even Canada flirted with the low to mid 90s. Many politicians and climate skeptics have criticized computer models as erring on the side of predicting temperatures that are too hot and outcomes that are too apocalyptic with global warming. But Druyan said the problem is most computer models, especially when compared to their predictions of past observations, underestimate how bad global warming is. That's because they see too many rainy days, which tends to cool temperatures off, he said. There is an established link between rainy and cooler weather and hot and drier weather, said Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Rainy days means more clouds blocking the sun and more solar heat used to evaporate water, Druyan said. "I'm sorry for the bad news," Druyan said. "It gets worse everywhere." Trenberth said the link between dryness and heat works, but he is a little troubled by the computer modeling done by Lynn and Druyan and points out that recently the eastern United States has been wetter and cooler than expected. A top U.S. climate modeler, Jerry Mahlman, criticized the study as not matching models up correctly and "just sort of whistling in the dark a little bit." But Andrew Weaver of the University of Victoria, editor of the journal Climate but not of this study, praised the paper, saying "it makes perfect sense." He said it shows yet another "positive feedback" in global warming, where one aspect of climate change makes something else worse and it works like a loop. "The more we start to understand of the science, the more positive feedbacks we start to find," Weaver said. Weaver said looking at the map of a hotter eastern United States he can think of one thing: "I like living in Canada."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/socal_fire	Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire - Yahoo! News Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire By ANDREW GLAZER, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 1 minute ago AVALON, Calif. - Firefighters working through the night turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and forced hundreds of people to evacuate amid falling ashes. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of a massive force of fire trucks and water-dropping aircraft on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. Flames that had menaced the city the night before were no longer visible from Avalon on Friday. A puff of smoke rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor and a layer of ash were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon, feeding on dry brush and being fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small businesses in the canyons outside the city burned. About 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders, and hundreds of residents and tourists lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. Friday's forecast promised better firefighting conditions. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday were expected to calm to 10 mph and were blowing the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of that fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 &#151; the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. In Minnesota, a wildfire that has already destroyed 45 structures threatened about 200 more structures and closed half of the 57-mile Gunflint Trail. The fire has burned about 45 square miles since it started Saturday at a campsite on remote Ham Lake. No injuries have been reported. In Maryland, a fast-moving fire, whipped by high winds, consumed a large warehouse on the Eastern Shore that served as a food processing plant during both world wars. Associated Press writers Daisy Nguyen and Christina Almeida in Los Angeles, and Gillian Flaccus in Long Beach contributed to this report.

News Rice confronts assertive Russia with less leverage Fri May 11, 9:54 AM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State will grapple with a newly assertive Kremlin that rejects U.S. views on missile defense, and the course of Russian democracy when she visits Moscow next week. What is unclear is how much leverage she has to influence Russian President , who has made no secret of his dislike of American foreign policy in and elsewhere, his mistrust of U.S. missile defense plans in Europe and his desire for Russia to play a bigger role on the world stage. Rice&#39;s trip to Moscow on Monday and Tuesday will be her first extended talks with Russia&#39;s top leadership since Putin stunned the West with a harsh critique of U.S. policies in a February 10 speech in Munich. Among other things, Putin accused the United States of making the world a more dangerous place by pursuing policies designed to make it "one single master." In an apparent allusion to the U.S.-led war in Iraq, he said "unilateral actions have not resolved conflicts but made them worse." The speech has left analysts wondering whether Moscow has decided to be less cooperative with Washington, which wants Russian acquiescence, if not support, on issues from reining in Iran&#39;s nuclear program to promoting independence for Kosovo. Analysts said Putin&#39;s rhetoric reflected Russia&#39;s expansive view of its own power, swelled in part by oil wealth, and its perception of a United States diminished by the war in Iraq. "President Putin thinks that the United States has been weakened by Iraq and that he has been strengthened by recent events and high-priced oil and he is trying to put Russia back on the international map," Richard Holbrooke, a former U.S. ambassador to the , said this week. Andrew Kutchins, a Russia scholar at Washington&#39;s CSIS think tank, said: "To the extent that they view their position as relatively more powerful, they will be more assertive of their interests and less compliant." Clifford Gaddy, a Brookings Institution scholar, said the United States has far less influence with the Kremlin now than under former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, when Moscow was heavily dependent on "We have zero leverage. The only leverage we ever had on the Russians was the financial dependence of Russia in the late 1980s and in the 1990s," Gaddy said. "With the current oil boom, that is gone." U.S. officials, however, stressed that they work closely with Russia on some sensitive issues, notably . Russia delighted them this year by delaying fuel shipments for the nuclear plant it is building at Bushehr in southwest Iran. A major challenge for Rice is quelling Russian anger at U.S. plans to deploy 10 missile interceptors in Poland and radar in the Czech Republic from 2012 to help shield Europe from possible missile attack from countries like Iran. The plan has also sparked concerns among some U.S. allies in Europe, although these appear to be abating, and exposed skepticism among U.S. members of Congress, who could stymie the administration&#39;s plans by starving it of funding. The House of Representatives Armed Services Committee has voted to cut spending on European missile defense by about &#36;160 million. But it is not clear what Congress will ultimately do. The committee&#39;s vote must still go to the full chamber, and then be reconciled with a Senate bill, giving the White House time to win over doubters. The United States has offered Russia what is describes as unprecedented cooperation on missile defense and has said it is ludicrous to believe that 10 interceptors could threaten the Russian nuclear arsenal of thousands of warheads. It also says it will try to allay Russian fears the system might be expanded to threaten Russia&#39;s nuclear deterrent. Another area of disagreement is over the centralization of power under Putin, a concern Rice voiced again this week. Some analysts believe the administration has been too soft in its criticism and suggested this emboldened the Kremlin. "The Russian conclusion from this is that when you talk to Americans, carry a big stick. The more you beat them, the better they behave.

News Cuba says U.S. broke anti-terrorism treaties HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba accused the United States on Friday of violating international anti-terrorism treaties by failing to prosecute an anti-Castro militant and former operative wanted for bomb attacks against the country. Cuba said Washington should have arrested Cuban exile Luis Posada Carriles under its own Patriot Act as a security threat and called for his extradition to Venezuela to stand trial for plotting from Caracas the downing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people in 1976. "The U.S. government should have tried Posada Carriles for terrorism," Cuba said in a statement that deplored the freeing of the accused bomber in United States after a U.S. judge dismissed immigration fraud charges against him on Tuesday. "Let&#39;s see what the White House does now. It still has the option to fulfill its international obligations to detain Luis Posada Carriles and extradite him to Venezuela," the statement published in the Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Cuba said the immigration indictment was a "smoke screen" to avoid prosecuting Posada Carriles for acts of violence that would have revealed his links over 25 years to the Posada Carriles, 79, was arrested in Miami in 2005 after illegally entering the United States. Cuba also accuses him of plotting a wave of bomb blasts in Havana hotels and nightclubs that killed an Italian tourist in 1997. By not prosecuting Posada Carriles for his violent past, the United States had failed to comply with U.N. Resolution 1373, a wide-ranging counter-terrorism adopted in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, among other international conventions, Cuba said. The Cuban exile could yet be indicted on terrorism charges in the United States by a federal grand jury impaneled in Newark, New Jersey to determine his role in the 1997 Havana bombings, the Miami Herald reported last week. took the unusual step of sending agents to Cuba to gather evidence late last year, the newspaper said. In a 1998 interview, Posada Carriles told The New York Times he plotted the wave of bomb blasts from Central America. He later denied saying so. Trained by the CIA for its failed Bay of Pigs invasion to oust Cuban leader in 1961, Posada Carriles was jailed in Venezuela for the 1976 bombing of the Cuban airliner, but escaped from prison in 1985. He was jailed in Panama for plotting to blow up Castro during a regional summit in 2000, but was pardoned by outgoing President Mireya Moscoso in 2004. Cuba has displayed in an exhibition hall evidence of the string of bombings allegedly masterminded by the man it calls Latin America&#39;s Photographs show plastic explosives smuggled into Cuba in shampoo bottles, digital clocks used to make time bombs and damages caused by the blasts. Targets included Havana&#39;s famed Tropicana cabaret and the Bodeguita del Medio, where writer Ernest Hemingway once drank his mojitos.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/ts_nm/iraq_usa_funding_dc	House passes Iraq funds bill Bush would veto - Yahoo! News House passes Iraq funds bill Bush would veto Fri May 11, 6:37 AM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives defied President George W. Bush President George W. Bush on Thursday and passed an war funds bill providing only enough money to continue combat for two or three months, without a guarantee of future funding. By a vote of 221-205, the House approved the Democratic-backed bill giving Bush &#36;42.8 billion in emergency military funds for the wars in Iraq and But in a Democratic drive to bring the four-year-old Iraq war to an end, the bill would withhold an additional &#36;52.8 billion until late July, after Bush submits progress reports. Lawmakers then would decide whether to use this second batch of money to continue combat, or bring U.S. troops home. Bush wants the nearly &#36;100 billion up front and without conditions. "I&#39;ll veto the bill if it&#39;s this haphazard, piecemeal funding," Bush said earlier in the day. The war-funding debate now moves to the Senate, which will try to amend the House bill enough to avert a second Bush veto. On May 1, Bush rejected a Democratic-backed bill that would have started U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq by October 1, with a non-binding goal of removing all combat soldiers by March 31. Senators appear more willing to give Bush the &#36;100 billion at once. Still unknown is how far the Senate might go in setting binding "benchmarks" to measure progress in Iraq. Bush said he&#39;ll back benchmarks but he and congressional Republicans do not want to spell out actions the U.S. would take if Iraqi progress in securing the country falls short. Arguing for the House&#39;s latest war-funding plan, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( ), a Maryland Democrat, said, "The president of the United States himself has stated that our commitment in Iraq is not open ended. That&#39;s what this legislation says." During a daylong debate that demonstrated deep divisions in Congress, Rep. John Murtha ( ), a Pennsylvania Democrat, said, "We need to get our troops out of the killing zone." While Democrats praised U.S. troops for achieving every major mission they&#39;ve been assigned, Democrats blamed Bush for mishandling the war by failing to craft a successful political strategy for Baghdad. As evidence, Murtha described a country worse-off than before the war began in March 2003. Iraq&#39;s oil and electricity production are below pre-war levels, there is less potable water than when Iraqi President ruled and Iraqis are sagging under steep price inflation and high unemployment rates, he said. The war also has killed 3,381 U.S. soldiers and injured more than 24,000, and Iraqis have suffered worse losses during sectarian strife that Democrats have labeled a civil war. Rep. Jerry Lewis ( ) of California, the senior Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, countered that Democrats&#39; reluctance to fully fund the troops "clearly calls into question their commitment to men and women in uniform." Defense Secretary Robert Gates, in a letter to Congress, said the House Democrats&#39; two-step funding plan "would cause significant disruptions to the effective and efficient operation" of the military. He said the prolonged fight with Congress over war funding also "negatively impacts our forces in the field" by delaying mine-resistant vehicles and other combat equipment. While most Republicans voted against the House bill, some have begun to put Bush on notice that without a turnaround in Iraq by September or October, their support for continuing the war might not be guaranteed. Lawmakers from both political parties have been particularly irked over tentative plans by Iraq&#39;s parliament to take a long summer break, with U.S. troops still in danger. Staunch anti-war Democrats on Thursday pushed for a complete withdrawal of combat troops by early 2008. While they lost on a 255-171 vote, backers said the vote demonstrated a sizable portion of the House wants to end the unpopular war.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070511/ts_afp/britainpolitics	Britain&#39;s Brown launches PM bid, vows new style - Yahoo! News Britain&#39;s Brown launches PM bid, vows new style Fri May 11, 10:02 AM ET LONDON (AFP) - Finance minister Gordon Brown launched his bid to become Britain&#39;s next prime minister Friday, vowing a different style from the media-friendly and saying he will not be a "celebrity" leader. Brown, widely expected to become leader of the governing Labour Party -- and therefore prime minister -- announced his candidacy a day after Blair revealed he would call time on his decade in power on June 27. Widely seen as dour in contrast to the charismatic, media-friendly Blair, Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown vowed that he would demonstrate his ability to take on the top job in the coming weeks. "In the weeks and months ahead, my task is to show that I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people," said Brown. "As a politician I have never sought the public eye for its own sake. I have never believed presentation should be a substitute for policy," he said at a carefully orchestrated presentation in central London. "I do not believe politics is about celebrity." Brown is the clear frontrunner to succeed Blair, after the only credible possible rivals for the leadership of the centre-left Labour Party pulled out of the race in recent weeks. Brown won a long-awaited formal endorsement from Blair on Friday. The prime minister has repeatedly ducked the chance to name Brown as his chosen successor, but on Friday at last gave his support to the chancellor, hailing him as an "extraordinary and rare talent." "I&#39;m absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labour Party and prime minister and to endorse him fully," Blair told reporters. "He&#39;s shown, as perhaps as the most successful chancellor in our country&#39;s history, that he&#39;s got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great prime minister." A poll released Friday showed that Brown is seen as less trustworthy and in touch than main opposition Conservative leader David Cameron, though a majority considered him tough (59 percent) and having firm principles (54 percent). The chancellor&#39;s campaign manager, Jack Straw, said Friday that Brown would bring his own style to the premiership, but would not bring in sweeping policy changes. "You are not going to get a dramatic shift here, but of course you will get a different style of leadership, because Gordon Brown is a different person from Tony Blair," the former foreign secretary told BBC radio. In particular, commentators question whether Brown will set a different tone in foreign policy, notably in ties with the United States, following Blair&#39;s close relationship with US President George W. Bush President George W. Bush US Secretary of State said Washington would continue to work extremely closely with London a Brown premiership. "Britain and America will always be friends and I know that we&#39;ll work very, very well with Gordon Brown when he becomes prime minister," she told BBC radio. But Brown has given his first hints that he might cool ties with Washington. He was non-committal in an interview with the weekly Time magazine when asked if he thought US President George W. Bush was someone he could do business with. "President Bush is the elected leader of the American people," he replied. "I was pleased to have the chance to talk to him ... I have over the years worked with different administrations ... And I think with both parties in America relationships are strong." And on Friday he said that he accepted that "mistakes" had been made in before insisting that Britain remained committed to ongoing efforts to bring peace to the violence-scarred country. After announcing his resignation Thursday, Blair got straight back down to business on Friday, holding talks with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani before heading to Paris for talks with incoming French president Nicolas Sarkozy.

News Iraq lobbies Congress for U.S. support By ANNE FLAHERTY, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 41 minutes ago WASHINGTON - Worried Congress' support for is deteriorating rapidly, Baghdad dispatched senior officials to Capitol Hill this week to warn members one-on-one that pulling out U.S. troops would have disastrous consequences. The lobbying push targeted Republicans and Democrats alike, but focused primarily on those considered influential on the war debate. On Thursday, hours before the House voted to limit funds for the war, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh met with more than 30 House Republicans and more than a half-dozen senators, including Sens. Harry Reid ( ), D-Nev., John Warner ( "He understands that American patience is waning," said Sen. Norm Coleman ( ), after eating lunch with Saleh, Iraqi Ambassador Samir Shakir al-Sumaidaie and Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( But the lobbying by the Iraqis isn't the only pressure-point being applied in Washington. Clinton said Friday she considered it "promising" that several Republican House members went to the White House and told they believe the continuing war is adversely affecting the party. She said the GOP lawmakers told Bush pointblank that "he has to change course in Iraq." But she also said she didn't think that Bush was ready to reverse course. "I think we're going to go back and forth on this for a while longer," Clinton said in an interview Friday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program with Joe Scarborough. "It is clear that whatever the mission used to be, it is either accomplished or over," she said. "If there are remaining American interests, then let's spell them out." Baghdad's ability to sell members like Coleman, R-Minn., and Chambliss, R-Ga., on the war effort is critical if the Iraqi government wants U.S. troops to stay. Coleman in recent months has become deeply skeptical of the president's decision to send additional troops to Iraq and says patience on the war in general is limited. Coleman, Chambliss and Sen. John Sununu ( ), R-N.H., who met separately with Saleh, will be up for re-election next year &#151; facing voters who have grown tired of a war in its fifth year and that has killed more than 3,380 troops. While Republicans have been reluctant to intervene, many say President Bush has until September to tell if the troop buildup in Iraq is working before they demand another approach. With the clock ticking, Saleh &#151; a Kurdish politician highly regarded by U.S. officials and who speaks impeccable English &#151; said he came to Capitol Hill to convey the "imperative of success" in Iraq. "Iraq is a central battleground in this historic conflict" against terrorism, he said in a brief interview after meeting with Reid, the Senate majority leader. His trip came on the heels of a visit by Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, along with three other senior advisers, according to the Iraqi embassy. The New York Times first reported al-Rubaie's visit on Tuesday. The timing of these meetings is no mistake. This month, Congress is expected to send Bush legislation that funds the war in Iraq but requires the Baghdad government meet certain political and security reforms. In question is what consequences the Iraqis should face if they fail. Democrats want U.S. troops to leave, Republicans say they don't want to force redeployments, but some say they would be open to withholding more than $5 billion in foreign aid. The House voted 221-205 Thursday for a stronger measure that would fund the war only through July, giving Congress the option of cutting off money after that. The bill is unlikely to survive in the Senate, although it indicates the war's unpopularity among members and their frustration with the lack of progress in the Iraqi parliament. The most recent irritant among U.S. lawmakers was a report that Iraqi officials would break for two months this summer. "Our armed forces are up to 150,000 troops; we're over $600 billion appropriated for this, lost 3,300 lives, 25,000 wounded fellow citizens. ... And the Iraqi answer? We're taking a summer off. Goin' fishing," said Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( Saleh said he expects the vacation to be shortened by at least a month, although nothing had been decided. He added that Iraqis value being independent and do "not take kindly of (U.S. officials) telling us when to recess." Democrats seemed to consider these meetings with Iraqi officials as beneficial &#151; if only to convey their frustration to Iraqi officials in person. Reid's spokesman Jim Manley said the senator told Saleh that "U.S. patience, blood and treasure were not unlimited and that the Congress would be taking a more decisive role in the coming weeks and months." "Salih understood the point, and said he would deliver the message to the Iraqi cabinet," Manley added.

News Cheney warns Iran, assures allies on Gulf visit Fri May 11, 10:20 AM ET ABOARD USS JOHN C. STENNIS (Reuters) - Vice President said on Friday the heightened U.S. military presence in the Gulf demonstrated Washington&#39;s resolve in a standoff with over Tehran&#39;s nuclear plans. "With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we&#39;re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike," said Cheney on a visit to the John C. Stennis aircraft carrier off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, a close U.S. ally. "We&#39;ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating the region," he said, speaking from a cavernous hangar bay. Stennis officials said 3,500 to 4,000 of the 5,000 personnel aboard were on hand. Iran denies any intention to develop nuclear weapons but the United States and have refused to rule out military action if diplomatic efforts to halt its civilian nuclear drive come to nothing. Iran also denies U.S. and British accusations that it is fuelling violence in "I want you to know that the American people do not support a policy of retreat. We want to complete the mission, get it done right, and return with honor," Cheney said, drawing cheers. Cheney has said Iran would top his talks with Arab leaders during his regional visit. "The (Iranians) are obviously a major source of concern not only for the United States but also for most of our friends in the area, who are worried when they see an Iranian government that appears to be operating in a threatening manner... So Iran is a big area of concern," Cheney told Fox News on Thursday. Iran&#39;s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is shadowing Cheney in the region and is due to visit the UAE on Saturday or Sunday, just after the vice president leaves.

Tech dad: Graduation 'right for us' By KRISTEN GELINEAU, Associated Press Writer BLACKSBURG, Va. - Some families of the 32 shooting victims couldn't bear to attend Virginia Tech's graduation Friday. Others said they had no choice but to come. "We have to. This is right for us," said Peter Read, whose freshman daughter Mary Karen Read was among those killed in the April 16 attack. The school issued diplomas and class rings to him and relatives of the other 26 student victims. Five faculty members were also slain before the gunman killed himself. Read had traveled from Annandale with 15 family members for the ceremony, which he said "recognizes what all of the students were here to do. It validates their choices, and it validates what they were doing." School spokesman Mark Owczarski said security remains high because some families may feel unsettled returning to the campus. Typical to measures for a home football game, bags will be checked before the ceremony, but guests will not pass through metal detectors or undergo more intrusive security measures. Gen. John Abizaid, who oversaw Operation Iraqi Freedom, is the keynote speaker. issued a statement praising "the compassion and resilient spirit" of the Virginia Tech community and the 3,600 graduating seniors and others earning advanced or associate degrees. "Laura and I salute the Virginia Tech Class of 2007. We also remember the students and teachers whose lives were taken last month," he said. "They will always hold a special place in the hearts of this graduating class and an entire nation." Twins Andrea and Michelle Falletti of Chantilly, Va., said they will not let the shootings overshadow their college memories of , spring breaks, camping trips and partying with friends. Their parents and grandparents will be in the audience, and it will, in many ways, still be the graduation they've long envisioned. "Obviously, what has happened has affected everything in our lives, and it will affect graduation," said Andrea Falletti, 21. "In a way, it's not going to be celebrating us as much; it's more about what we've done as a community. But that's OK. I'm proud of what we've done here." Richard Roopan, a business information technology major who posed for photos Thursday in his cap and gown outside Torgersen Hall, said the atmosphere on campus was "a little bit more somber than celebratory." After nearly four weeks of mourning, Roopan said he hopes there will be some joy. "But you have to remember them, also, and what they could have done and their achievements and how, you know, this moment that we have right now has been taken away from them," he said. Leaving Blacksburg won't be easy, Andrea Falletti said. "It's brought us closer, but in a different way," she said. "We're all kind of having these same feelings now. It's kind of a special thing."

News Brown vows to give power to the people 1 hour, 27 minutes ago KNEBWORTH (Reuters) - Britain&#39;s Gordon Brown pledged on Friday to put "citizens in control" and end personality-driven politics if elected to take over from the charismatic Launching his campaign to become leader of the ruling Labour party, Brown said his government would be a servant of the state, not handing down edicts from on high. It would listen to voters and not be afraid to admit mistakes and change. "I do not believe politics is about celebrity," finance minister Brown said. "I have never believed that presentation can be a substitute for policy. "This is the 21st century progressive view: the citizen in control. Being served, not told, by government. A servant state." Critics say Blair, blessed with a huge majority at the start of his rule, centralized power and bypassed parliament. He was also damaged by allegations that political parties nominated people for state honors in return for funding. "Government must be more open and accountable to parliament. For example, in decisions about peace and war, in public appointments and in a new ministerial code of conduct," Brown said in central London. Britain would stand by its U.N. obligations in , but Brown admitted mistakes had been made and said the emphasis must change: greater economic development and political reconciliation to give all Iraqis a stake in their future. Blair&#39;s popularity suffered after he sent British forces to join the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. A Labour Party rebellion in September forced him to say he would quit within a year. Britain pushed debt relief and international development to the top of the agenda when president of the Group of Eight rich nations in 2005. Speaking in the southern English town of Knebworth, Brown pledged to fight for an education for the 80 million children in the world who do not go to school and to eliminate diseases such as malaria, diphtheria and tuberculosis. Brown has waited impatiently in the wings for the top job and got the green light on Thursday when Blair said he would step down as prime minister on June 27 after 10 years in power. Blair&#39;s resignation triggered a party leadership contest and Brown is the only contender so far. The new Labour leader automatically becomes prime minister. Labour lags the main opposition Conservatives badly in opinion polls and Brown needs to regain the support of the English middle classes if he is to win the next national election, expected in 2009. The economy has been one of Brown&#39;s trump cards but critics say the housing boom that made thousands of people paper millionaires has raised inequality and put property ownership out of the reach of many. Brown said public services would be a priority of his leadership and he pledged to provide affordable housing for all. Blair enthusiastically backed Brown&#39;s bid to become Britain&#39;s next leader and U.S. Secretary of State pledged to maintain strong transatlantic ties. "I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labour Party and prime minister, and to endorse him fully," Blair told reporters. Brown has stressed the need for strong ties with Washington but he will want to avoid being portrayed as President George W. Bush President George W. Bush &#39;s lapdog, a criticism often leveled at Blair in Britain. (Additional reporting by Sophie Walker, Fiona Shaikh, Adrian Croft and Paul Majendie) Hundreds flee S.
