News Men apologize for Boston cartoon stunt By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 57 minutes ago BOSTON - Prosecutors said they would not pursue charges against two men who planted electronic devices around the city as part of a botched advertising campaign after the pair apologized Friday for causing a bomb scare. Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28, also performed community service at a rehabilitation center in a deal with prosecutors. In contrast to their first court appearance in January, when they mugged for the camera and waved to friends in the courtroom, the men offered contrite apologies and said they never expected the stunt to cause any turmoil. "I deeply regret that this incident caused such anguish and disruption to so many people," Berdovsky told the Charlestown District Court. Stevens said he saw the devices simply as "harmless entertainment." "I had no intention of upsetting or alarming anyone," he said. The two were accused of planting about three dozen battery-powered devices in Boston and Cambridge on Jan. 31. The devices, a promotion for Cartoon Network, had lights that created images of a cartoon character making an obscene gesture. Fears of terrorism arose when the devices were discovered in a subway station and on a bridge, among other locations. Bomb squads were deployed, and highways, bridges and some transit stations were temporarily closed. Similar signs were placed in nine other cities around the United States, but only in Boston did they elicit such a response. Berdovsky and Stevens were charged with placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct. Attorney General Martha Coakley said it would have been difficult to prove to a jury that the men intended to create panic, and that she did not believe they realized the problems the ads would cause. "We believe this was an appropriate and fair resolution," Coakley said. Berdovsky said he was relieved the case was resolved without a trial. "I am looking forward to what the future has to bring. I'm just going to be working really hard and working on my art and working to build a really peaceful community for all of us to live in," Berdovsky told The Associated Press by telephone after the hearing. Berdovsky performed 80 hours of service and Stevens completed 60 hours at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston. The men designed a cartoon mural that will be painted in a waiting area for children undergoing physical therapy, said Oz Mondejar, Spaulding's vice president of human resources. They also helped patients use computers, cleaned the hospital's sailing docks and helped produce a DVD featuring patients talking about their rehabilitation successes. Turner Broadcasting and the advertising agency that carried out the campaign, Interference Inc., agreed to pay a $2 million settlement to cover costs and restitution for the law enforcement response. The head of the Cartoon Network resigned nine days after the stunt. Full Coverage: Media Issues Coulter cleared in Florida vote probe AP via Yahoo! News, May 11 Calif.

News Pistons take 3-0 series lead on Bulls Fri May 11, 8:00 AM ET CHICAGO - Tayshaun Prince scored 23 points and Chauncey Billups added 21, and the rallied from a 19-point deficit to beat the Bulls 81-74 on Thursday night in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Pistons, who swept Orlando in the first round, will try to wrap up this one Sunday at the United Center. "We love a challenge, man," Billups said. "We love any time we can get 20,000 fans against us and we can start hearing the crowd boo us and the hecklers. We just take that challenge, man, and we love those situations. We thrive on those situations." No NBA team has won a best-of-seven series after dropping the first three games, and only three major professional teams have done that: the 1942 The other Eastern Conference semifinal resumes Saturday at New Jersey with Cleveland leading 2-0. In the Western Conference semifinals, Utah, which leads 2-0, is at Golden State on Friday, and Phoenix is at San Antonio on Saturday in a series tied 1-1. After blowing out the Bulls in the first two games at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the Pistons trailed 44-28 at halftime. They were down 49-30 early in the third and 55-38 midway through the quarter, and they certainly were hearing it from a raucous crowd. But Prince, Billups and Wallace brought them back. Now, they're one win away from their fifth straight conference finals. "Perseverance &#151; that's the type of team that we are," Wallace said. "No matter what the deficit is, we feel that we can come back from it." Prince scored 13 points in the third quarter and Billups added 10. Wallace had a block in the closing seconds and hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to pull Detroit within 61-60. He then put the Pistons ahead with a jumper just under two minutes into the fourth period and added a 3-pointer that made it a five-point game midway through the quarter. Wallace had 16 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks for Detroit, and Richard Hamilton scored 16 points. Luol Deng led Chicago with 21 points, but was just 8-for-22 from the field. The Bulls were 28-of-83 (33.7 percent), almost the same percentage (33.6) they managed in the first two games, and again, they had no answer for the Pistons' zone. Detroit used it most of the second half, and the Bulls shot 10-of-41, including 4-for-25 in the fourth quarter. And while Bulls coach Scott Skiles again downplayed its effectiveness, saying his team was "getting shots all over the place," Wallace had another view. "That's just lying to themselves about things that we do," Wallace said. Chicago came up short at the free throw line as well, missing 10 in the game, seven of those in the fourth quarter. "We just lost on our homecourt, so this loss hurts a lot more than the other two, even though we played hard tonight and fought hard," Deng said. "I think we played better today than last two games, but it's still a loss and it still hurts." The Bulls outscored the Pistons 22-6 over the final 7:15 of the second quarter, turning a 22-22 tie into a 44-28 halftime lead. Detroit coach Flip Saunders showed his team clips of the first half during the break, and to Prince the problems were obvious. "We didn't have fun in the first half, the ball wasn't moving," he said. "We just talked about moving the basketball. ... Once we made the adjustments we were in good shape." With the score 55-38 midway through the third quarter, Detroit scored 12 straight points, eight by Prince. Ben Gordon scored 16 points for Chicago, but was 4-for-16 from the field, while Kirk Hinrich had 13 points. Ben Wallace showed up at the arena about 1 hour, 15 minutes before tipoff and finished with five points, 12 rebounds and two blocks. "It's the biggest loss of everybody's life because it's the last game," Gordon said. "We had a 19-point lead and they chipped away at it. It's tough to lose like that." Notes:@ Ben Wallace would not say why he was late, telling reporters: "I don't have to explain myself to nobody." Skiles, who was not thrilled about the late arrival, said: "Somebody said the traffic was really bad at that time. I mean it usually is in Chicago. I really haven't given it a lot of thought. That wasn't high on my list of priorities." ... Detroit shot 4-of-18 in the second quarter and 6-of-20 in the fourth. But the Pistons went 13-of-22 in the third.

News Iran, North Korea seek to boost cooperation Fri May 11, 10:50 AM ET have agreed to step up bilateral contacts, an Iranian news agency said on Friday, signaling closer ties between two countries which were part of U.S. President George W. Bush President George W. Bush &#39;s "axis of evil." Iran&#39;s Foreign Minister Manoucher Mottaki signed the agreement with visiting North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Yong-il on Thursday evening, the student news agency ISNA said. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#39;s government "is interested in expanding ties with North Korea in the political, economical and cultural fields," Mottaki was quoted as saying. "Therefore it is necessary to remove some barriers to provide and recognize new fields of cooperation," he said, suggesting North Korea&#39;s debt to Iran was one such barrier without giving details. Under Thursday&#39; accord, the foreign ministries of the two countries would every year send delegations to each other to "exchange ideas" over different international issues. Bush branded the two countries as well as as part of an "axis of evil" after he took office in 2001. Since then, Iran has defied Western pressure to suspend its nuclear program, which the West fears is aimed at making atom bombs, a charge Tehran denies. North Korea drew international condemnation when it conducted its first nuclear test in October, but agreed in February this year to shut its nuclear facilities in return for energy aid.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/ts_nm/pope_brazil_dc	Pope decries hedonism to Latin American faithful - Yahoo! News Pope decries hedonism to Latin American faithful By Philip Pullella and Todd Benson Fri May 11, 11:56 AM ET SAO PAULO (Reuters) - gave Brazil its first native-born saint on Friday and called on Roman Catholics to spurn media portrayals of life that glamorize pre-marital sex and undermine the traditional family. The Pope said a mass for hundreds of thousands of joyful, flower-waving faithful to canonize Friar Antonio Galvao, a Franciscan who lived in the 18th century and founded an order of nuns. "The world needs transparent lives, clear souls, pure minds that refuse to be perceived as mere objects of pleasure," he said in his sermon on a military airfield outside Brazil&#39;s largest city on the third day of his first visit to Latin America. "It is necessary to oppose those elements of the media that ridicule the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage," he said to applause from the crowd. Faithful flocked to the open-air mass from across Brazil, the world&#39;s largest Catholic country, and elsewhere in Latin America. Many camped out overnight in chilly weather although the crowd was smaller than the more than one million people organizers had expected. Pope Benedict&#39;s canonization of Friar Galvao was an important part of his mission on this trip to revitalize the Church in Latin America, home to nearly half the world&#39;s 1.1 billion Catholics. Brazilians hoping for a miracle often swallow so-called Friar Galvao Pills, tiny pieces of rice paper with prayers written on them. He is considered a guardian of women in labor and the has attributed two miracles to him -- the curing of a 4-year-old girl who was believed to have an incurable disease and the survival of a mother and child in a high-risk pregnancy. The mother, Sandra Grossi de Almeida, and her 7-year-old son Enzo went on the stage to hug the Pope during the canonization ceremony. Benedict praised Galvao for helping the poor and the sick, and for trying to be a peacemaker in his times. During his trip so far, the 80-year-old Pontiff has firmly reinforced the Church&#39;s opposition to abortion and called for a return to traditional family values. But in a country where sex outside marriage is common, birth control is widely used, and divorce is not frowned upon, his message has had a mixed reception. "This pope is a little too rigid, especially when it comes to issues like marriage," said Elisangela do Nascimento, 33-year-old divorced housewife from Sao Paulo in the crowd. The trip, his first to Latin America since he was elected two years ago, is also a test of the Pope&#39;s personal appeal as he tries to staunch the flow of followers away from the Catholic church to Protestant groups, a huge concern for the Vatican. A conservative theologian who has spent nearly 25 years of his life in the Vatican&#39;s corridors of power, some faithful have seen him as lacking the warmth and charisma that made his predecessor However, Vatican officials have insisted from the start of his Pontificate that Benedict is his own man and he appeared to be winning some hearts and minds. "We thought he was going to be a disappointment but he surprised us. People say he&#39;s authoritarian, but he&#39;s just a bit shy and sweet," said Lucilene Gutierres, a 21-year-old student, who spent the night at the airfield waiting to see him. Francisco Fortes, 60, said he was a direct descendent of Friar Galvao and lived in his hometown Guaratingueta. "This Pope has turned out to be a surprise. He seemed to be more reserved. But he&#39;s coming out of his shell here in Brazil," he said. The Pope will meet Brazilian bishops in Sao Paulo&#39;s Se Cathedral later on Friday and then travel to the holy shrine city of Aparecida, where he will deliver the opening address to a conference of Latin American and Caribbean bishops.

News Brown vows to learn from Iraq mistakes By D'ARCY DORAN, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 3:08 PM ET LONDON - Gordon Brown signaled a shift in policy in and a new vision for Britain as he launched his campaign Friday to become the country's next prime minister. Appearing before a standing ovation of hand-picked supporters only hours after Prime Minister formally endorsed his candidacy, Brown, who has waited more than a decade for his chance to lead the country, strode to the podium and confidently laid out a platform that promised to be both compassionate and tough. "I will listen, and I will learn. I will strive to meet people's aspirations," Brown said, pledging to win back disenchanted voters. "I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place." Brown signaled that as prime minister, he would abandon Blair's presidential style of leadership by restoring Parliament's authority in decisions such as when to go to war. Government must be accountable, he said. "I accept that mistakes have been made," Brown said, without offering specifics. "We will keep our obligations to the Iraqi people. These are obligations that are part of U.N. resolution, they are in support of a democracy. I do think that over the next few months the emphasis will shift." The question is how much Brown will shift Britain's role in the Iraq war, which has divided the country. He indicated he wants to devote more time and resources toward the creation of jobs and basic services for the Iraqi people. "There are too many people in Iraq who don't have a stake in the economic future of the country, too many people unemployed, too many people who are not seeing services developed ... and therefore too many people who don't feel loyalty to the regime," he said. Brown did not outline specifics on his Iraq policy. He said he will make his first trip to Iraq in the coming weeks to inspect the situation. Blair announced in February that his government &#151; the top U.S. ally in the Iraq war &#151; will reduce its troop level by 1,600 to about 5,500 by spring, but will retain a presence in southern Iraq until at least 2008. A total of 148 British soldiers have died since the 2003 invasion. Brown also promised to be strong on defense and security. "And obviously we've got to do more to win the battle of hearts and minds against al-Qaida terrorism," he said. Brown's speech at a converted Edwardian-era school in central London was the first act in his campaign to become Labour Party chief &#151; and as a result, British leader. It also marked Brown's first effort to emerge from the shadow of the telegenic Blair &#151; a challenge for the wonkish Brown, who must show he can connect with voters. The campaign to revamp the Treasury chief's rumpled image hit an immediate snag when the teleprompters he was using obscured his face for the live television audience. He seemed more relaxed shaking hands of the party faithful in later televised appearances. Brown took the London subway, known as the Tube, to the event, impressing at least one Londoner, 20-year-old student Rohini Simbodyal. "We got on the Tube and people were looking at Gordon Brown," Simbodyal said. "People were amazed, saying, 'It's Gordon.' But everyone was very British, they looked and then looked away. A few people came up and shook his hand and said, 'Good luck.'" "He was just like a normal guy," she said. also praised Brown's forthrightness, describing him as "easy to talk to." But it remains to be seen how close the two men might become. Brown has been more reserved in his comments about Bush, whose alliance with Blair cost the Labour Party votes. Bush and Blair have had a close relationship, speaking regularly by phone and videoconference and getting together for talks at least twice a year since 2003. said Brown was aware of the dangers surrounding failure in Iraq, and she didn't expect U.S.-British relations to change dramatically. "Britain and America will always be friends and I know that we will work very, very well with Gordon Brown when he becomes prime minister," Rice told the British Broadcasting Corp.

News New domain names could come in mid-2008 By ANICK JESDANUN, AP Internet Writer Fri May 11, 3:44 PM ET NEW YORK - New Internet addresses for general use could start appearing in the summer of 2008 under a timeline the Internet's key oversight agency announced Thursday. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers invited public comment on procedures for creating new names, the first expansion for general use since 2000. Names added since then have been limited to specific regions or industries. "This is all about choice," Chief Executive Paul Twomey said in a statement. "We want the diversity of the world's people, geography and business to be able to be represented in the domain name system." Domain names are key for helping computers find Web sites and route e-mail. There are currently about 250 domain name suffixes, most of them for specific countries such as ".fr" for France. General-use names include ".com" and ".net." In 2000, two years after its designation by the U.S. government as the authority for overseeing Internet naming policies, ICANN approved seven new names, but only ".info" and ".biz" were truly for general use. ICANN solicited additional applications in 2004 and has approved six regional or industry-specific names, such as ".travel" and ".asia," while rejecting ".xxx" for the adult entertainment industry. Also added were .jobs, .mobi, .cat, and .tel. Some ICANN critics have complained that the agency has been slow to approve new names and that the procedures have sometimes been arbitrary. Businesses and trademark owners, meanwhile, worry that more names will lead to more cybersquatting, the practice of grabbing names before companies can in hopes of selling them at a premium. ICANN did not specify how individuals and groups would be able to seek new names, but the group indicated that the procedures would be streamlined to permit "a much wider variety of them to be added in a timely, predictable and efficient manner." An ICANN committee, the Generic Names Supporting Organization, still is reviewing the procedures. Once it sends a recommendation to the ICANN board, procedures could be adopted by year's end and applications for new names could be accepted early next year. Twomey said new names could be reviewed and added into the system in the June-August 2008 timeframe. The new addresses are likely to be in English. ICANN could wrap up the technical work on non-Latin scripts by year's end, but it still must resolve policy questions such as who should decide what countries get what suffixes and how to make sure a domain in one language isn't inadvertently offensive in another.

Prosecutors argued that the men, all born outside the United States, pose a flight risk. They are being held at a federal detention center in Philadelphia. The men were arrested Monday during what the said was an attempt to buy AK-47 machine guns, M-16s and other weapons. They targeted Fort Dix, a post 25 miles east of Philadelphia that is used primarily to train reservists, partly because one of them had delivered pizzas there and was familiar with the base, according to court filings. Their objective was to kill "as many American soldiers as possible," the documents said. The men have lived in and around Philadelphia for years, worshipped at moderate mosques and worked blue-collar jobs installing roofs, driving a cab, delivering pizzas and baking bread. Four are ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia, one is from Jordan and one is from Turkey. As they were led into the courtroom, each of the suspects smiled to relatives and friends, many of whom wept and blew kisses to them. Only one of the men, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, 22, asked to be released on bail, and friends and relatives offered to post properties they owned as collateral. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Stigall argued against letting Shnewer be released to the custody of his parents while awaiting trial. He said many of the illegal actions that the government alleges Shnewer committed happened or were planned at his parents' house. Defense lawyers for some of the men said they are considering attacking the prosecution's reliance on two paid informants who infiltrated the group more than a year ago and recorded conversations with the defendants. Authorities said they first learned about the men in January 2006 after a tip from a clerk at a Mount Laurel electronics store. Circuit City spokeswoman Jackie Foreman said Friday that credit for the tip is shared by two employees. She declined to name them but said the company has "communicated its appreciation." She declined to give details. The pair called police because a home video the men wanted transferred to a DVD looked like it might have terrorist links, U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie said. Earlier this year, authorities said, the men took a training trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where they fired weapons and played paintball to prepare for an attack. Five of the men &#151; Shnewer; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan "Anthony" or "Tony" Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir "Elvis" Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. Abdullahu, who faces the least serious charges of the six, will have another bail hearing next Thursday.

News Gas prices a drain on consumer dollars By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON - Consumers, battered by surging gasoline prices, cut back spending for clothes, cars and other items in April, raising worries about the already weak economy. Retail sales fell 0.2 percent in April, the first decline in seven months, the reported Friday. Meanwhile, the Labor Department said that wholesale prices surged by 0.7 percent, led by a third consecutive big rise in gasoline prices. The weak retail spending and the big rise in gasoline prices were seen as delivering a double whammy to the economy. The worry is that if gasoline prices spike further and the troubles in housing deepen, then consumers could significantly trim spending and the country could move toward a recession. In Washington, a city with some of the longest commuting times in the country, consumers were definitely feeling the pinch of the higher gasoline prices. "It's highway robbery," said Andi Powell, 33. She said she and her boyfriend are spending about $90 per week in gas for their commute to Washington from Baltimore. "I just started to do a lot more home entertaining, just trying to find ways to make up the difference" in the higher gas costs. Zenobia Jackson, 32, of College Park, Md., said she is spending $60 to $80 per week for gas to drive to her computer job in Virginia. "There's not much I can do," she said. Growth in the overall economy slowed to a lackluster 1.3 percent rate in the first three months of this year, the slowest pace in four years. Analysts were looking for that figure to be revised even lower based on a string of weaker-than-expected economic reports, raising the odds that some unexpected jolt could turn weak growth into an outright downturn. "The higher gasoline prices combined with a weakening housing market and a softer job market are weighing on consumers," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. , who sent financial markets into a tailspin back in February with his worries about a recession, used the "R" word again on Friday although he sought to put a more positive spin on his views, emphasizing the likelihood that a downturn can be avoided. "The odds are 2-to-1 that we won't have a recession," Greenspan said in a speech delivered by satellite to a business group in Singapore, according to a participant. Wall Street was not jolted by Greenspan's latest comments as investors took comfort from the price report because it showed little price pressure outside the areas of energy and food. The Dow Jones industrial average soared 111.09 points on Friday, its biggest point rise so far this month, to end the week at 13,326.22. The rebound gained back most of the nearly 150 points the Dow had lost on Thursday. The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes food and energy, was unchanged in April, better than the 0.2 percent rise analysts had expected. The Federal Reserve this week kept interest rates where they have been since last June, with officials saying they remained more worried about the threats from inflation than the weakening economy. Some analysts said the Fed could be making a mistake by keeping rates too high for too long especially if consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity, weakens further. "Consumers are being pressured by surging energy and food costs and they don't have that much left over to spend on lots of other things," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. The weak report on retail sales from the government came a day after a survey of the nation's biggest retailers, who reported disappointing sales in April. Analysts said some of the problems reflected the fact that Easter came early this year, pulling sales into March that would normally have occurred in April. But they still worried about the widespread nature of April's sales weakness. There were declines in sales at auto dealerships, hardware stores, specialty clothing stores and department stores. The 0.2 percent drop would have been an even larger 0.4 percent fall if it had not been for a 1.7 percent jump in sales at gasoline stations, reflecting the higher pump prices. Analysts said motorists are likely to see gas prices rise even higher in May, reflecting a loss of refinery capacity this spring because of unexpected shutdowns. Gasoline surged to a record nationwide average of $3.07 per gallon, nearly 20 cents higher than two weeks earlier, according to the latest Lundberg Survey. That surpassed the record of $3.03 per gallon set last August. The 0.7 percent increase in wholesale prices last month followed an even larger 1 percent jump in March with gasoline prices rising by more than 8 percent in each month. Wholesale food costs were up 0.4 percent in April, a significant slowing after four straight months of 1 percent-plus readings. Outside of food and energy, the unchanged performance of core inflation reflected a decline of 1 percent for new cars and a 0.5 percent drop in the category that includes sport utility vehicles.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/ts_nm/security_germany_warning_dc	U.S. officials say Germany threat may involve Kurds - Yahoo! News U.S. officials say Germany threat may involve Kurds By David Morgan and Kristin Roberts WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A threat warning issued by the United States in Germany last month could involve attack plans by an al Qaeda-affiliated group of Kurdish militants, officials said on Friday. U.S. and German authorities said, however, that there was no new threat in Germany beyond the official April 20 State Department warning. They were responding to a report by ABC News on its Web site on Friday that officials believe terrorists were in the advanced planning stages for an attack on U.S. military personnel or tourists in Germany. In the April 20 warning, the U.S. Embassy in Germany encouraged Americans in the country to increase their vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their personal security. "We&#39;re unaware of anything new. We have not changed our force posture," a U.S. defense official said on Friday. In Germany, the Interior Ministry said there had been no change in the security situation. "There is nothing new," a spokesman for the ministry said. "What we&#39;re looking at is the state of affairs that has been long since known. This caused the U.S. authorities to publish a warning to their own citizens in Germany." Counterterrorism officials in Europe and the United States have for weeks been investigating a suspected plot against U.S. interests in the country, which will host a G8 summit of major industrialized countries next month. U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said recent intelligence reports suggested possible involvement by Kurdish Islamists from outside Germany. The group is believed to be affiliated with al Qaeda but not formally a part of the militant network led by , they said. They had no specific information about targets or timing. Some German media reports have suggested involvement by Iraqi militants. However, U.S. officials rejected the notion of a role by Ansar al-Islam, a militant group of Iraqi Kurds and Arabs who have vowed to establish an independent Islamic state in "There is intelligence reporting suggesting there is a group interested in staging an attack, potentially in Germany," said a U.S. official who asked not to be named because the issue involves classified information. "The thinking is that this plot was beyond the talking stage, certainly," the official added. "The concerns are real, but not new." ABC News quoted German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble as saying, "The danger level is high. We are part of the global threat by Islamist terrorism." The ABC report, quoting U.S. and German law enforcement officials, said Patch Barracks, headquarters to the U.S. military&#39;s European Command, could be a target following reports that suspected terrorists had conducted surveillance at the facility. An official with U.S. European Command said there was no new intelligence strong enough to warrant heightened security at military facilities in Germany. "The threat condition has not been raised," the official said. "There&#39;s been no actionable intelligence." German Chancellor Angela Merkel will host the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States at the June 6-8 summit, which will focus on climate change, African poverty and economic cooperation. Schaeuble has said border controls have been tightened ahead of the summit.

The format for this attribute should be in the DSM-CC's Normal Play Time (NTP) as used in RTSP [ RFC 2326 3.6 Normal Play Time ]. It is an optional attribute. NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use. Allows a taxonomy to be set that gives an indication of the type of media content, and its particular contents. It has 2 optional attributes. is the URI that identifies the categorization scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is 'http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/category_schema'. is the human readable label that can be displayed in end user applications. It is an optional attribute. This is the hash of the binary media file. It can appear multiple times as long as each instance is a different . It has 1 optional attribute. indicates the algorithm used to create the hash. Possible values are 'md5' and 'sha-1'. Default value is 'md5'. It is an optional attribute. Allows the media object to be accessed through a web browser media player console. This element is required only if a direct media attribute is not specified in the element. It has 1 required attribute, and 2 optional attributes. is the url of the player console that plays the media. It is a required attribute. is the height of the browser window that the should be opened in. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the browser window that the should be opened in. It is an optional attribute. Notable entity and the contribution to the creation of the media object. Current entities can include people, companies, locations, etc. Specific entities can have multiple roles, and several entities can have the same role. These should appear as distinct elements. It has 2 optional attributes. role specifies the role the entity played. Must be lowercase. It is an optional attribute. is the URI that identifies the role scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is 'urn:ebu'. See: European Broadcasting Union Role Codes. actor anchor person author choreographer composer conductor director editor graphic designer grip illustrator lyricist music arranger music group musician orchestra performer photographer producer reporter vocalist European Broadcasting Union Role Codes Copyright information for media object. It has 1 optional attribute. is the url for a terms of use page or additional copyright information. If the media is operating under a Creative Commons license, the Creative Commons module should be used instead. It is an optional attribute. Allows the inclusion of a text transcript, closed captioning, or lyrics of the media content. Many of these elements are permitted to provide a time series of text. In such cases, it is encouraged, but not required, that the elements be grouped by language and appear in time sequence order based on the time. Elements can have overlapping times. It has 4 optional attributes. Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module. A movie review with a trailer, using a Creative Commons license. My Movie Review Site Movie Title: Is this a good movie? A music video with a link to a player window, and additional metadata about the video, including expiration date. Discussions of great videos The latest video from an artist Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light Several different songs that relate to the same topic. Discussion on different songs These songs make me think about blah Same song with multiple files at different bitrates and encodings. (Bittorrent example as well) Songs galore at different bitrates Cool song by an artist Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this specification, and to all those that sent suggestions and corrections.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_sc/hot_future	NASA study: Eastern U.S. to get hotter - Yahoo! News NASA study: Eastern U.S. to get hotter By SETH BORENSTEIN, AP Science Writer 2 hours, 13 minutes ago WASHINGTON - Future eastern United States summers look much hotter than originally predicted with daily highs about 10 degrees warmer than in recent years by the mid-2080s, a new Previous and widely used global warming computer estimates predict too many rainy days, the study says. Because drier weather is hotter, they underestimate how warm it will be east of the Mississippi River, said atmospheric scientists Barry Lynn and Leonard Druyan of Columbia University and NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. "Unless we take some strong action to curtail carbon dioxide emissions, it's going to get a lot hotter," said Lynn, now a scientist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "It's going to be a lot more dangerous for people who are not in the best of health." The study got mixed reviews from other climate scientists, in part because the eastern United States has recently been wetter and cooler than forecast. Instead of daily summer highs in the 1990s that averaged in the low to mid 80s Fahrenheit, the eastern United States is in for daily summer highs regularly in the low to mid 90s, the study found. The study only looked at the eastern United States because that was the focus of the funding by the U.S. And that's just the eastern United States as a whole. For individual cities, the future looks even hotter. In the 2080s, the average summer high will probably be 102 degrees in Jacksonville, 100 degrees in Memphis, 96 degrees in Atlanta, and 91 degrees in Chicago and Washington, according to the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Climate. But every now and then a summer will be drier than normal and that means even hotter days, Lynn said. So when Lynn's computer models spit out simulated results for July 2085 the forecasted temperatures sizzled past uncomfortable into painful. The study showed a map where the average high in the southeast neared 115 and pushed 100 in the northeast. Even Canada flirted with the low to mid 90s. Many politicians and climate skeptics have criticized computer models as erring on the side of predicting temperatures that are too hot and outcomes that are too apocalyptic with global warming. But Druyan said the problem is most computer models, especially when compared to their predictions of past observations, underestimate how bad global warming is. That's because they see too many rainy days, which tends to cool temperatures off, he said. There is an established link between rainy and cooler weather and hot and drier weather, said Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Rainy days means more clouds blocking the sun and more solar heat used to evaporate water, Druyan said. "I'm sorry for the bad news," Druyan said. "It gets worse everywhere." Trenberth said the link between dryness and heat works, but he is a little troubled by the computer modeling done by Lynn and Druyan and points out that recently the eastern United States has been wetter and cooler than expected. A top U.S. climate modeler, Jerry Mahlman, criticized the study as not matching models up correctly and "just sort of whistling in the dark a little bit." But Andrew Weaver of the University of Victoria, editor of the journal Climate but not of this study, praised the paper, saying "it makes perfect sense." He said it shows yet another "positive feedback" in global warming, where one aspect of climate change makes something else worse and it works like a loop. "The more we start to understand of the science, the more positive feedbacks we start to find," Weaver said. Weaver said looking at the map of a hotter eastern United States he can think of one thing: "I like living in Canada."

Calif. island fire turned from town By ANDREW GLAZER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET AVALON, Calif. - Firefighters turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and some residents planned to return to their homes Friday after thousands were forced to evacuate a day earlier. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of dozens of fire trucks and air tankers on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. "Everyone is working very hard to make sure that the people are safe and the animals are safe," Gov. Most of the 76-square-mile island is owned by a land conservancy, home to wildlife including the Catalina Island fox, North American bison and bald eagle. Flames that had menaced the main city of Avalon the night before were no longer visible from there on Friday. But a layer of ash and a puff of smoke that rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon in the island's rugged interior, feeding on dry brush and fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small structures in the canyons outside the city burned. About 3,800 residents and tourists fled, Schwarzenegger said. As people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland, many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Anita Bussing, a therapist who has a second home on the island, described a sky "completely gray with orange streaks." The helicopters were flying all over the place," she said. "People were freaking out, children were crying." Island hotel worker Susana Garcia, 22, waited long into the night at the dock looking for her father. She had gone to the mainland to do errands before the fire started and was unable to reach her father, who had stayed behind. "I've been asking everybody if they've seen him, but I haven't found him yet," Garcia said. Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. One firefighter was overcome by inhalation and was in stable condition. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday calmed and were expected to blow the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Television actor Steven W. Bailey, who lives near the park, had gone to Catalina with his wife to escape the smoke and heat on Thursday. As they approached the island, he spotted the smoke of the island blaze, and when they arrived, they weren't allowed to check into their hotel. "It just descended into more and more fire, more and more smoke, more and more ash," Bailey told KABC-TV. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of the Griffith Park fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 &#151; the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away. Associated Press writers Daisy Nguyen and Christina Almeida in Los Angeles, and Gillian Flaccus in Long Beach contributed to this report.

News Rice confronts assertive Russia with less leverage Fri May 11, 9:54 AM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State will grapple with a newly assertive Kremlin that rejects U.S. views on missile defense, and the course of Russian democracy when she visits Moscow next week. What is unclear is how much leverage she has to influence Russian President , who has made no secret of his dislike of American foreign policy in and elsewhere, his mistrust of U.S. missile defense plans in Europe and his desire for Russia to play a bigger role on the world stage. Rice&#39;s trip to Moscow on Monday and Tuesday will be her first extended talks with Russia&#39;s top leadership since Putin stunned the West with a harsh critique of U.S. policies in a February 10 speech in Munich. Among other things, Putin accused the United States of making the world a more dangerous place by pursuing policies designed to make it "one single master." In an apparent allusion to the U.S.-led war in Iraq, he said "unilateral actions have not resolved conflicts but made them worse." The speech has left analysts wondering whether Moscow has decided to be less cooperative with Washington, which wants Russian acquiescence, if not support, on issues from reining in Iran&#39;s nuclear program to promoting independence for Kosovo. Analysts said Putin&#39;s rhetoric reflected Russia&#39;s expansive view of its own power, swelled in part by oil wealth, and its perception of a United States diminished by the war in Iraq. "President Putin thinks that the United States has been weakened by Iraq and that he has been strengthened by recent events and high-priced oil and he is trying to put Russia back on the international map," Richard Holbrooke, a former U.S. ambassador to the , said this week. Andrew Kutchins, a Russia scholar at Washington&#39;s CSIS think tank, said: "To the extent that they view their position as relatively more powerful, they will be more assertive of their interests and less compliant." Clifford Gaddy, a Brookings Institution scholar, said the United States has far less influence with the Kremlin now than under former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, when Moscow was heavily dependent on "We have zero leverage. The only leverage we ever had on the Russians was the financial dependence of Russia in the late 1980s and in the 1990s," Gaddy said. "With the current oil boom, that is gone." U.S. officials, however, stressed that they work closely with Russia on some sensitive issues, notably . Russia delighted them this year by delaying fuel shipments for the nuclear plant it is building at Bushehr in southwest Iran. A major challenge for Rice is quelling Russian anger at U.S. plans to deploy 10 missile interceptors in Poland and radar in the Czech Republic from 2012 to help shield Europe from possible missile attack from countries like Iran. The plan has also sparked concerns among some U.S. allies in Europe, although these appear to be abating, and exposed skepticism among U.S. members of Congress, who could stymie the administration&#39;s plans by starving it of funding. The House of Representatives Armed Services Committee has voted to cut spending on European missile defense by about &#36;160 million. But it is not clear what Congress will ultimately do. The committee&#39;s vote must still go to the full chamber, and then be reconciled with a Senate bill, giving the White House time to win over doubters. The United States has offered Russia what is describes as unprecedented cooperation on missile defense and has said it is ludicrous to believe that 10 interceptors could threaten the Russian nuclear arsenal of thousands of warheads. It also says it will try to allay Russian fears the system might be expanded to threaten Russia&#39;s nuclear deterrent. Another area of disagreement is over the centralization of power under Putin, a concern Rice voiced again this week. Some analysts believe the administration has been too soft in its criticism and suggested this emboldened the Kremlin.

News Cuba says U.S. broke anti-terrorism treaties HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba accused the United States on Friday of violating international anti-terrorism treaties by failing to prosecute an anti-Castro militant and former wanted for bomb attacks against the country. Cuba said Washington should have arrested Cuban exile Luis Posada Carriles under its own Patriot Act as a security threat and called for his extradition to Venezuela to stand trial for plotting the 1976 downing of a Cuban plane that killed 73 "The U.S. government should have tried Posada Carriles for terrorism," Cuba said in a statement that deplored the freeing of the accused bomber after a U.S. judge dismissed immigration fraud charges against him on Tuesday. "Let&#39;s see what the White House does now. It still has the option to fulfill its international obligations to detain Luis Posada Carriles and extradite him to Venezuela," said the statement published in the Communist Party newspaper Granma. Cuba said the immigration indictment was a "smoke screen" to avoid prosecuting Posada Carriles for acts of violence that would have revealed his links over 25 years to the Central Trained by the CIA for its failed Bay of Pigs invasion to in 1961, Posada Carriles was jailed in Venezuela for the 1976 bombing of the Cuban airliner, but escaped from prison in 1985. Venezuela, Cuba&#39;s leftist ally, requested his extradition from the United States in 2005, but got no response. Posada Carriles, 79, was arrested in Miami in 2005 after illegally entering the United States. Cuba also accuses him of plotting a wave of bomb blasts in Cuban hotels and nightclubs to sabotage Cuba&#39;s tourism industry in 1997. A Italian tourist By not prosecuting Posada Carriles for his violent past, the United States had failed to comply with U.N.

In a 1998 interview, Posada Carriles told The New York Times he plotted the wave of bomb blasts from Central America funded by Cuban exiles in Miami. He later denied saying so. On Friday, Cuba published transcripts of telephone calls it said Posada Carriles made from in 1997 to an associate in Venezuela about the Havana blasts. "We have two more explosions: we placed one in the Sol Palmeras Hotel in Varadero and the other in a discotheque in Havana," Posada Carriles said, according to the transcripts published by Granma. It did not say how they were obtained but said they were passed to the FBI as evidence. Cuba has displayed evidence of the string of bombings allegedly masterminded by the man it calls Latin America&#39;s Photographs show plastic explosives smuggled into Cuba in shampoo bottles, digital clocks used to make time bombs and damages caused by the blasts.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/ts_nm/iraq_usa_funding_dc	House passes Iraq funds bill Bush would veto - Yahoo! News House passes Iraq funds bill Bush would veto Fri May 11, 6:37 AM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives defied President George W. Bush President George W. Bush on Thursday and passed an war funds bill providing only enough money to continue combat for two or three months, without a guarantee of future funding. By a vote of 221-205, the House approved the Democratic-backed bill giving Bush &#36;42.8 billion in emergency military funds for the wars in Iraq and But in a Democratic drive to bring the four-year-old Iraq war to an end, the bill would withhold an additional &#36;52.8 billion until late July, after Bush submits progress reports. Lawmakers then would decide whether to use this second batch of money to continue combat, or bring U.S. troops home. Bush wants the nearly &#36;100 billion up front and without conditions. "I&#39;ll veto the bill if it&#39;s this haphazard, piecemeal funding," Bush said earlier in the day. The war-funding debate now moves to the Senate, which will try to amend the House bill enough to avert a second Bush veto. On May 1, Bush rejected a Democratic-backed bill that would have started U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq by October 1, with a non-binding goal of removing all combat soldiers by March 31. Senators appear more willing to give Bush the &#36;100 billion at once. Still unknown is how far the Senate might go in setting binding "benchmarks" to measure progress in Iraq. Bush said he&#39;ll back benchmarks but he and congressional Republicans do not want to spell out actions the U.S. would take if Iraqi progress in securing the country falls short. Arguing for the House&#39;s latest war-funding plan, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( ), a Maryland Democrat, said, "The president of the United States himself has stated that our commitment in Iraq is not open ended. That&#39;s what this legislation says." During a daylong debate that demonstrated deep divisions in Congress, Rep. John Murtha ( ), a Pennsylvania Democrat, said, "We need to get our troops out of the killing zone." While Democrats praised U.S. troops for achieving every major mission they&#39;ve been assigned, Democrats blamed Bush for mishandling the war by failing to craft a successful political strategy for Baghdad. As evidence, Murtha described a country worse-off than before the war began in March 2003. Iraq&#39;s oil and electricity production are below pre-war levels, there is less potable water than when Iraqi President ruled and Iraqis are sagging under steep price inflation and high unemployment rates, he said. The war also has killed 3,381 U.S. soldiers and injured more than 24,000, and Iraqis have suffered worse losses during sectarian strife that Democrats have labeled a civil war. Rep. Jerry Lewis ( ) of California, the senior Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, countered that Democrats&#39; reluctance to fully fund the troops "clearly calls into question their commitment to men and women in uniform." Defense Secretary Robert Gates, in a letter to Congress, said the House Democrats&#39; two-step funding plan "would cause significant disruptions to the effective and efficient operation" of the military. He said the prolonged fight with Congress over war funding also "negatively impacts our forces in the field" by delaying mine-resistant vehicles and other combat equipment. While most Republicans voted against the House bill, some have begun to put Bush on notice that without a turnaround in Iraq by September or October, their support for continuing the war might not be guaranteed. Lawmakers from both political parties have been particularly irked over tentative plans by Iraq&#39;s parliament to take a long summer break, with U.S. troops still in danger. Staunch anti-war Democrats on Thursday pushed for a complete withdrawal of combat troops by early 2008. While they lost on a 255-171 vote, backers said the vote demonstrated a sizable portion of the House wants to end the unpopular war.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070511/ts_afp/britainpolitics	Britain&#39;s Brown launches PM bid, vows new style - Yahoo! News Britain&#39;s Brown launches PM bid, vows new style 1 hour, 45 minutes ago LONDON (AFP) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown launched his bid to become Britain&#39;s next prime minister Friday, vowing a different style from the media-friendly and saying he will not be a "celebrity" leader. Brown, runaway favourite to become leader of the governing Labour Party -- and therefore prime minister -- announced his candidacy a day after Blair revealed he would call time on his decade in power on June 27. Widely seen as dour in contrast to the charismatic Blair, 56-year-old Brown vowed he would demonstrate his ability to take on the top job in the coming weeks. "In the weeks and months ahead, my task is to show that I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people," he said at a carefully-orchestrated presentation in central London. "As a politician I have never sought the public eye for its own sake. I have never believed presentation should be a substitute for policy," he added, as wife Sarah looked on. "I do not believe politics is about celebrity." But his vow for a greater transparency in government immediately ran into difficulties as a poorly positioned "invisible" glass autocue obscured his face on television pictures and from his audience. Brown is the clear frontrunner to succeed Blair, after possible heavyweight rivals for leadership of the centre-left Labour Party pulled out of the race in recent weeks. But with two left-wingers wanting to stand in what is expected to be only a token challenge, he said he welcomed any other candidate and would still fight hard for every vote, before immediately hitting the campaign trail. Brown, who praised Blair for leading Britain with "distinction, with courage, passion and insight," finally won a formal endorsement from the prime minister Friday. Blair has repeatedly avoided naming Brown as his successor, but at last gave his support, hailing him as an "extraordinary and rare talent." "I&#39;m absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labour Party and prime minister and to endorse him fully," said Blair, who remains Labour leader and prime minister until June 27. "He&#39;s shown, as perhaps the most successful chancellor in our country&#39;s history, that he&#39;s got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great prime minister." But a poll released Friday suggested Brown is seen as less trustworthy and in touch than main opposition Conservative leader David Cameron, though most considered him tough (59 percent) and having firm principles (54 percent). Brown&#39;s campaign manager, Jack Straw, said Brown would bring his own style of leadership but there would be no sweeping policy changes. "You are not going to get a dramatic shift here, but of course you will get a different style of leadership, because Gordon Brown is a different person from Tony Blair," the former foreign secretary told BBC radio. In particular, commentators question whether Brown will set a different tone in foreign policy, notably in ties with the United States, following Blair&#39;s close, some say too close, relationship with US President George W. Bush President George W. Bush US Secretary of State said Washington would continue to work extremely closely with London under a Brown premiership. "Britain and America will always be friends and I know that we&#39;ll work very, very well with Gordon Brown when he becomes prime minister," she told BBC radio. Bush, who met Brown in April and meets Blair in Washington for the last time on Wednesday, said Friday he found the chancellor "easy-to-talk-to," adding that he was a "good thinker." The president said he did not anticipate the change in leadership would alter Britain&#39;s stance on the war. Brown "understands the consequences of failure," he added.

News Iraqi officials discourage U.S. pullout By ANNE FLAHERTY, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - Worried Congress' support for is deteriorating rapidly, Baghdad dispatched senior officials to Capitol Hill this week to warn members one-on-one that pulling out U.S. troops would have disastrous consequences. The lobbying push targeted Republicans and Democrats alike, but focused primarily on those considered influential on the war debate. On Thursday, hours before the House voted to limit funds for the war, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh met with more than 30 House Republicans and more than a half-dozen senators, including Sens. Harry Reid ( ), D-Nev., John Warner ( "He understands that American patience is waning," said Sen. Norm Coleman ( ), after eating lunch with Saleh, Iraqi Ambassador Samir Shakir al-Sumaidaie and Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( But the lobbying by the Iraqis isn't the only pressure-point being applied in Washington. Clinton said Friday she considered it "promising" that several Republican House members went to the White House and told they believe the continuing war is adversely affecting the party. She said the GOP lawmakers told Bush pointblank that "he has to change course in Iraq." But she also said she didn't think that Bush was ready to reverse course. "I think we're going to go back and forth on this for a while longer," Clinton said in an interview Friday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program with Joe Scarborough. "It is clear that whatever the mission used to be, it is either accomplished or over," she said. "If there are remaining American interests, then let's spell them out." Baghdad's ability to sell members like Coleman, R-Minn., and Chambliss, R-Ga., on the war effort is critical if the Iraqi government wants U.S. troops to stay. Coleman in recent months has become deeply skeptical of the president's decision to send additional troops to Iraq and says patience on the war in general is limited. Coleman, Chambliss and Sen. John Sununu ( ), R-N.H., who met separately with Saleh, will be up for re-election next year &#151; facing voters who have grown tired of a war in its fifth year and that has killed more than 3,380 troops. While Republicans have been reluctant to intervene, many say President Bush has until September to tell if the troop buildup in Iraq is working before they demand another approach. With the clock ticking, Saleh &#151; a Kurdish politician highly regarded by U.S. officials and who speaks impeccable English &#151; said he came to Capitol Hill to convey the "imperative of success" in Iraq. "Iraq is a central battleground in this historic conflict" against terrorism, he said in a brief interview after meeting with Reid, the Senate majority leader. His trip came on the heels of a visit by Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, along with three other senior advisers, according to the Iraqi embassy. The New York Times first reported al-Rubaie's visit on Tuesday. The timing of these meetings is no mistake. This month, Congress is expected to send Bush legislation that funds the war in Iraq but requires the Baghdad government meet certain political and security reforms. In question is what consequences the Iraqis should face if they fail. Democrats want U.S. troops to leave, Republicans say they don't want to force redeployments, but some say they would be open to withholding more than $5 billion in foreign aid. The House voted 221-205 Thursday for a stronger measure that would fund the war only through July, giving Congress the option of cutting off money after that. The bill is unlikely to survive in the Senate, although it indicates the war's unpopularity among members and their frustration with the lack of progress in the Iraqi parliament. The most recent irritant among U.S. lawmakers was a report that Iraqi officials would break for two months this summer. "Our armed forces are up to 150,000 troops; we're over $600 billion appropriated for this, lost 3,300 lives, 25,000 wounded fellow citizens. ... And the Iraqi answer? We're taking a summer off. Goin' fishing," said Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( Saleh said he expects the vacation to be shortened by at least a month, although nothing had been decided. He added that Iraqis value being independent and do "not take kindly of (U.S. officials) telling us when to recess." Democrats seemed to consider these meetings with Iraqi officials as beneficial &#151; if only to convey their frustration to Iraqi officials in person. Reid's spokesman Jim Manley said the senator told Saleh that "U.S. patience, blood and treasure were not unlimited and that the Congress would be taking a more decisive role in the coming weeks and months." "Salih understood the point, and said he would deliver the message to the Iraqi cabinet," Manley added.

News Cheney warns Iran, assures allies on Gulf visit Fri May 11, 10:20 AM ET ABOARD USS JOHN C. STENNIS (Reuters) - Vice President said on Friday the heightened U.S. military presence in the Gulf demonstrated Washington&#39;s resolve in a standoff with over Tehran&#39;s nuclear plans. "With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we&#39;re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike," said Cheney on a visit to the John C. Stennis aircraft carrier off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, a close U.S. ally. "We&#39;ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating the region," he said, speaking from a cavernous hangar bay. Stennis officials said 3,500 to 4,000 of the 5,000 personnel aboard were on hand. Iran denies any intention to develop nuclear weapons but the United States and have refused to rule out military action if diplomatic efforts to halt its civilian nuclear drive come to nothing. Iran also denies U.S. and British accusations that it is fuelling violence in "I want you to know that the American people do not support a policy of retreat. We want to complete the mission, get it done right, and return with honor," Cheney said, drawing cheers. Cheney has said Iran would top his talks with Arab leaders during his regional visit. "The (Iranians) are obviously a major source of concern not only for the United States but also for most of our friends in the area, who are worried when they see an Iranian government that appears to be operating in a threatening manner... So Iran is a big area of concern," Cheney told Fox News on Thursday. Iran&#39;s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is shadowing Cheney in the region and is due to visit the UAE on Saturday or Sunday, just after the vice president leaves.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070511/ts_afp/vaticanpopebrazil	Pope unveils plan for rebuilding Church in Latin America - Yahoo! News Pope unveils plan for rebuilding Church in Latin America 2 hours, 51 minutes ago SAO PAULO (AFP) - on Friday urged Brazilian bishops to "spare no effort" in rebuilding the Catholic Church in its Latin American stronghold to counter a proliferation of evangelical sects. "No effort should be spared in seeking out those Catholics who have fallen away," he told 430 prelates gathered at Sao Paulo&#39;s neo-gothic Cathedral of Se. "This meeting is a great ecclesial event and part of the missionary outreach which Latin America needs to undertake, beginning here -- on Brazilian soil," Benedict said in a tough-talking speech. Acknowledging that "the present is a difficult time for the Church," the pope spoke of the "worrying disorientation" of society, with marriage and the family under attack and "crimes against life (that) are justified in the name of individual freedom and rights." Within the Church, the pope also lamented the growing questioning of the requirement of priestly celibacy, which he reiterated "is a gift which the Church has received and desires to retain." Benedict noted: "A particular problem which you face as pastors is surely the issue of those Catholics who have abandoned the life of the Church," which he blamed primarily on "the lack of an evangelization completely centred on Christ and his Church." He said people who are "insufficiently evangelized (are) most vulnerable to the aggressive proselytizing of (evangelical) sects -- a just cause for concern -- and those who are incapable of resisting the onslaught of agnosticism, relativism and secularization." He said such people "are easily influenced because their faith is weak, confused, easily shaken and naive, despite their innate religiosity." Latin America is home to nearly half of the world&#39;s 1.1 billion Catholics, with Brazil the largest stronghold with 155,000. But in recent years the Church has lost ground to rival evangelical faiths, as well as to a growing number of people who have abandoned religion altogether. In Brazil, 64 percent of the population is Catholic, but the figure has fallen from 74 percent a decade ago, according to a recent study. At the same time, the number of evangelical followers has risen to 17 percent from 11 percent, the Datafolha institute said. Benedict proposed "on every level, a methodical evangelization aimed at personal and communal fidelity to Christ." Those who have abandoned the Church should be sought out "by implementing a pastoral plan which welcomes them and helps them realize that the Church is a privileged place of encounter with God," he said. "What is required, in a word, is a mission of evangelization capable of engaging all the vital energies present in this immense flock," he added. Benedict urged that missionaries be sent "to homes on the outskirts of the cities and in the interior," the two areas where Brazil&#39;s poor are concentrated. "The poor ... need to feel that the Church is close to them, providing for their most urgent needs, defending their rights and working together with them to build a society founded on justice and peace," he said. Benedict also addressed the severe lack of priests in Brazil, where in some places the ration can be one to 15,000 faithful. While Catholic priests must complete an elaborate seminary education, evangelical pastors need little training. One solution, therefore, is to train lay ministers to perform certain priestly functions. Benedict said: "I am aware of your commitment to seeking ways of forming new vocations to the priesthood and religious life," warning however that "this must always done in accord with the Churchs authentic Magisterium (dogma)." He also suggested that "good and assiduous spiritual direction is indispensable for fostering human growth and eliminating the risk of going astray in the area of sexuality." Benedict urged continuing attention to "the search for unity among Christians," which he said had become "more complex" "given the rapidly growing number of new Christian denominations, and especially certain forms of often aggressive proselytism." "The greatest area of common ground for collaboration should be the defence of fundamental moral values -- transmitted by the biblical tradition -- against the relativistic and consumerist cultural forces that seek to destroy them."

Tech graduations honor slain victims By KRISTEN GELINEAU, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 9 minutes ago BLACKSBURG, Va. - Thousands of Virginia Tech graduates struggled to balance joy with grief as commencement ceremonies got under way Friday, less than a month after a student gunman's rampage devastated the campus. In an address to about 600 of the nearly 1,200 graduate students who received master's degrees, President Charles Steger spoke to the community's grief while encouraging the graduates to be proud of their accomplishments and hopeful for their futures. "Our hearts are saddened and our minds are troubled," Steger said. A larger ceremony for some 3,600 graduating seniors was set for Friday evening, where the school planned to issue class rings to relatives of the 26 slain students, followed by diplomas in smaller ceremonies Saturday. "Short was their stay on this mortal stage. Great was their impact," Steger said of the slain students. Gunman Seung-Hui Cho also killed five faculty members and himself. His family will not receive a ring or diploma. During the graduate ceremonies, nine slain graduate students were awarded posthumous master's degrees or doctorates. Faculty members hugged the relatives who received them, some wiping away tears and all drawing long and loud applause from the crowd of several thousand. Graduate Scott Cassell, 55, of Roanoke, hadn't planned to attend the commencement ceremonies. But after the attacks, the father of five decided he would go as a show of support for the grieving families. "I just can't fathom the loss," said Cassell, who received a master's degree in information technology. Security employees checked the bags of guests, armed police officers patrolled the grounds and state troopers stood guard at every entrance. Guests did not have to pass through metal detectors, though, and school officials said the level of security was comparable to what they would see at a home football game. James Long, whose sister, Michelle, earned a degree in history, said students would not let the tragedy overshadow their celebration. "There are too many people here to celebrate five, six years of hard work to let one guy screw that up," said Long, 25, of Richmond. Some families couldn't bear to attend graduation. Others said they had no choice but to come. "We have to. This is right for us," said Peter Read, whose freshman daughter Mary Karen Read was among those killed. Peter and Cathy Read returned to campus for more than their daughter's degree. They also returned to erase an unsettling image from the minds of their two youngest sons, Patrick, 4, and Brendan, 2. "They're a little concerned that the bad man's going to shoot them," Cathy Read said. "We can't let that idea grow in their heads." issued a statement praising "the compassion and resilient spirit" of the Virginia Tech community and the 3,600 graduating seniors and others earning advanced or associate degrees. "Laura and I salute the Virginia Tech Class of 2007. We also remember the students and teachers whose lives were taken last month," he said. "They will always hold a special place in the hearts of this graduating class and an entire nation." Twins Andrea and Michelle Falletti of Chantilly, Va., said the shootings will not be what they remember when they look back on four years of college. Rather, they will recall spring breaks, camping trips and partying with friends. "Obviously, what has happened has affected everything in our lives, and it will affect graduation," said Andrea Falletti, 21. "In a way, it's not going to be celebrating us as much; it's more about what we've done as a community. But that's OK. I'm proud of what we've done here."

News Brown vows to give power to the people Fri May 11, 1:24 PM ET KNEBWORTH (Reuters) - Britain&#39;s Gordon Brown pledged on Friday to put "citizens in control" and end personality-driven politics if elected to take over from the charismatic Launching his campaign to become leader of the ruling Labour party, Brown said his government would be a servant of the state, not handing down edicts from on high. It would listen to voters and not be afraid to admit mistakes and change. "I do not believe politics is about celebrity," said Brown, whose serious manner contrasts with the telegenic Blair, often accused of putting style before substance. "I have never believed that presentation can be a substitute for policy," said Britain&#39;s long-standing finance minister. "This is the 21st century progressive view: the citizen in control. Being served, not told, by government. A servant state," he told supporters in London. Critics say Blair, blessed with a huge majority at the start of his rule, centralized power and bypassed parliament. He was also damaged by allegations that political parties nominated people for state honors in return for funding. "Government must be more open and accountable to parliament ... in decisions about peace and war, in public appointments and in a new ministerial code of conduct," said Brown. Britain would stand by its U.N. obligations in , but Brown admitted mistakes had been made and said the emphasis must change: greater economic development and political reconciliation to give all Iraqis a stake in their future. Blair was essentially driven from office because of the criticism he suffered after he sent British forces to join the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Brown now faces a difficult challenge of distancing himself from some of the government&#39;s unpopular policies, such as Iraq, that he helped shape with Blair -- and voted for. Britain pushed debt relief and international development to the top of the agenda when president of the Group of Eight rich nations in 2005. Speaking in the southern English town of Knebworth, Brown pledged to fight for an education for the 80 million children in the world who do not go to school and to eliminate diseases such as malaria, diphtheria and tuberculosis. Brown, who has waited impatiently in the wings for the top job, got the green light on Thursday when Blair said he would step down as prime minister on June 27 after 10 years in power. Blair&#39;s resignation triggered a party leadership contest but Brown is not expected to face a serious challenge. The new Labour leader automatically becomes prime minister. Labour lags the main opposition Conservatives badly in opinion polls and Brown needs to regain the support of the English middle classes if he is to win the next national election, expected in 2009. The economy has been one of Brown&#39;s trump cards but critics say the housing boom that made thousands of people paper millionaires has raised inequality and put property ownership out of the reach of many. Brown said public services would be a priority of his leadership and he pledged to provide affordable housing for all. Blair enthusiastically backed Brown&#39;s bid to become Britain&#39;s next leader and U.S. Secretary of State pledged to maintain strong transatlantic ties. "I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labour Party and prime minister, and to endorse him fully," Blair told reporters. Brown has stressed the need for strong ties with Washington but he will want to avoid being portrayed as President George W. Bush President George W. Bush &#39;s lapdog, a criticism often leveled at Blair in Britain.

News US Senate holds key to Iraq showdown 1 hour, 39 minutes ago WASHINGTON (AFP) - The top Democrat in the US Senate Friday staked out the next tussle between Congress and the White House over , arguing that political sands were shifting against President George W. Bush President George W. Bush Senator Harry Reid ( ) probed anew at signs of cracks in Republican support for Bush&#39;s strategy, hours after the House of Representatives defied Bush&#39;s veto threat and voted to fund the war in installments of only a few months. "In just the last few days, we have seen our Republican colleagues tell the president that his war strategy is failing," Reid said on the Senate floor. "This is a welcome shift. It is encouraging." The White House has denied Republican backing is fraying over the president&#39;s plan to surge nearly 30,000 more troops into Iraq, despite comments by several key Republicans in recent days that strategy changes might be needed if there is no demonstrable progress in Iraq by September. In the latest twist of a fierce political joust for control of the war, the House of Representatives voted 221 to 205 late Thursday to release 43 billion dollars (32 billion euros) in emergency war funds. The measure would handcuff Bush by requiring him to show progress in Iraq in July before he can collect another 53 billion dollars in financing. The legislation now moves to the more closely divided Senate, where the split financing component appears unlikely to survive, lining up an intense round of legislative bartering over the bill Bush will be asked to sign. "The House of Representatives is a different body than we are, the majority party there can do what they want to do -- we can&#39;t do that," Reid said. "The Senate is divided as we speak 50-49, so we have to work together on this." Senior White House and Senate aides have been holding discrete talks in search of a compromise on a war funding bill to replace the 124 billion dollar version vetoed by Bush last week over Democratic troop withdrawal timetables. Both Republicans and Democrats hope a reconciled version of the bill can be agreed and sent to Bush to sign by the end of May. An aide to Reid declined to say on Friday whether talks were taking place Friday or would happen at the weekend, or when the issue would come up on the Senate floor. Reid said Thursday that White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten had presented him with a proposal, but refused to divulge its contents. Also on Thursday, Bush reached out to Democrats and anxious Republicans by saying that inserting security, military and political benchmarks in the legislation that Iraq will be required to meet, made sense. In another new move Friday, respected Virginia Republican Senator John Warner ( ), who is preparing his own legislation on benchmarks, said he would like to see Bush report on conditions in Iraq before Congress&#39;s August recess. Warner said he would like Bush to say whether "some change in strategy must be brought about" in order to ensure success of the original surge plan. The debate is likely to sharpen on what penalty the fragile Iraqi government would pay for missing such targets. Some senators want General David Petraeus, commander of US troops in Iraq, to be required to set a timetable for withdrawing US combat troops should Iraqis fall short. That is likely to be opposed by the White House, but another option would see Iraq forfeit certain kinds of financial aid in the event of a failure to comply with the targets. , who just visited Iraq, told Fox News the benchmarks wrangle was simply "Washington talk" and noted Iraqis surely felt more pressured to act by raging violence than threats from Congress. But House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi ( ) argued: "benchmarks without consequences and enforcement are meaningless." Bush wielded his veto for only the second time last week to strike down the previous bill tying war funding to the timeline to start bringing home 146,000 troops in Iraq in October, from a war which has killed 3,386 of their comrades. Pressure on the president was underscored by news of a White House visit by 11 concerned Republican House members on Tuesday, which followed warnings by top Republicans that a "Plan B" might be needed if there is no clear success by September for the current US surge in Iraq. September is emerging as a possible make-or-break point for US Iraq strategy, as General David Petraeus, US commander in the country, is expected to outline results of the surge.

News Iran, North Korea seek to boost cooperation Fri May 11, 10:50 AM ET have agreed to step up bilateral contacts, an Iranian news agency said on Friday, signaling closer ties between two countries which were part of U.S. President George W. Bush President George W. Bush &#39;s "axis of evil." Iran&#39;s Foreign Minister Manoucher Mottaki signed the agreement with visiting North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Yong-il on Thursday evening, the student news agency ISNA said. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#39;s government "is interested in expanding ties with North Korea in the political, economical and cultural fields," Mottaki was quoted as saying. "Therefore it is necessary to remove some barriers to provide and recognize new fields of cooperation," he said, suggesting North Korea&#39;s debt to Iran was one such barrier without giving details. Under Thursday&#39; accord, the foreign ministries of the two countries would every year send delegations to each other to "exchange ideas" over different international issues. Bush branded the two countries as well as as part of an "axis of evil" after he took office in 2001. Since then, Iran has defied Western pressure to suspend its nuclear program, which the West fears is aimed at making atom bombs, a charge Tehran denies. North Korea drew international condemnation when it conducted its first nuclear test in October, but agreed in February this year to shut its nuclear facilities in return for energy aid.

News Ricky Williams fails marijuana test By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer 1 hour, 17 minutes ago MIAMI - Former NFL rushing champion Ricky Williams tested positive again for marijuana last month, which will delay his return to the league until at least September, a person familiar with the case said Friday. Williams sought to end a one-year drug suspension last month when he asked to rejoin the Following the positive drug test, clinicians in the NFL's substance abuse program advised commissioner Roger Goodell to delay reinstatement, the person close to the case said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the testing program. The Dolphins and the NFL declined comment. Williams, who turns 30 on May 21, has played only 12 games since 2003. Before his latest setback, new Miami coach Cam Cameron repeatedly declined to say whether he would welcome Williams back. Williams' latest positive test first was reported by ESPN.com. His agent, Leigh Steinberg, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. The NFL suspended Williams in April 2006 after he violated the league's drug policy for the fourth time. That failed test apparently involved a substance other than marijuana and may have been related to his interest in holistic medicine. Williams' previous positive drug tests were for marijuana, which he acknowledged using. Last year Williams played in the Canadian Football League, then taught yoga in California. Steinberg recently quoted Williams as saying his interest in Eastern philosophy had overcome his desire for mind-altering substances. Williams still owes the Dolphins $8.6 million for breaching his contract when he sat out the 2004 season, but they've given no signal they want him back. General manager Randy Mueller traded Williams when both were with the in 2002. Two-year starter Ronnie Brown is expected to return as Miami's starter at running back, and the team acquired running back Lorenzo Booker of Florida State in the third round of the draft last month. coach Scott Linehan, the offensive coordinator for the Dolphins when Williams last played in 2005, recently said he would consider acquiring Williams as a backup. Williams won the 1998 Heisman Trophy at Texas and the 2002 NFL rushing title with the Dolphins. Last season with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL, he rushed for 526 yards in 109 carries but missed two months with a broken arm.

News Wis. farmer finds new calf has two noses 1 hour, 16 minutes ago MERRILL, Wis. - Mark Krombholz had to look twice at his new calf, Lucy &#151; one time for each nose. "I didn't notice anything too different about her until I got her in the barn," Krombholz said, "and all of a sudden I went to feed her a bottle of milk, and I thought maybe she'd been kicked in the nose and there were two noses there." The second, smaller nose sits on top of the first. "It's a functioning nose because the middle of her second nose, the flap would go in and out when she drank out of the bottle like that," Krombholz said. "It was kind of funny." Breeder Scott Grund said Lucy's noses seem to be working fine. "It looked like she was comfortable laying there in her bedding and breathing and spunky just like you want to see," Grund said. "It's just that she's got two noses." That kind of rare deformity is usually not the result of genetics, he said. But breeders do track such mutations. "We'll fill out a form, send that on to the company in Shawano and they will keep record of it," Grund said. "If by chance this would occur more than a few times, they would start looking at maybe the sire that we're using." Krombholz said Lucy, who was born May 4, will be a pet and bred if she's able.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/ts_nm/security_usa_spies_dc	U.S. spies face uphill battle in ethnic recruitment - Yahoo! News U.S. spies face uphill battle in ethnic recruitment Fri May 11, 1:25 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government, in dire need of intelligence agents skilled in the languages and cultures of the Muslim world, is struggling to recruit from American ethnic communities grown wary of its policies. Relations with many minority communities, first soured by a post-September 11 crackdown on Muslim immigrants, have been further strained by uproars over the abuse scandal at prison, U.S. interrogation practices and President George W. Bush President George W. Bush &#39;s now-suspended domestic spying program, experts said. "Right now, there is a great degree of mistrust," said Christopher Whitney, executive director for studies at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, which conducts research on U.S. ethnic communities. "America has a need for their skill sets. But a lot of them are mistrustful of the government&#39;s intentions (and) how their skills would be used," he said. Study Group report in December said intelligence officers in Iraq are often unable to understand information from local informants because they lack language and cultural skills. , the premier spy agency whose recruiting program is seen as a model for other agencies, only 46 percent of jobs requiring proficiency in one or more of 10 "mission critical" languages, from Arabic and Farsi to Chinese and Korean, are filled by people judged to be fully proficient. "We&#39;re looking for language capability, deep cultural expertise. We&#39;re looking for Arab Americans, Afghan Americans, South Asian American, Persian Americans," said CIA Associate Deputy Director Michael Morell. U.S. intelligence chief Mike McConnell&#39;s office is in the early stages of a new outreach program to first- and second-generation Americans from Middle Eastern and Asian families who might serve as linguists, analysts or spies. McConnell&#39;s staff has a raft of plans and ideas for the push, from generous hiring bonuses, scholarships and loan repayment aid to mentoring programs and special focus groups to facilitate security clearance. The administration has even come up with a plan to invest in high school and elementary school language programs to help ensure that the children of immigrants retain their family&#39;s language skills. "It&#39;s a matter of strategic imperative," said Ron Sanders, chief human capital officer for the 16-agency U.S. intelligence community that stretches from the CIA to the Coast Guard. But officials say recruitment faces a series of hurdles including an onerous security clearance process. U.S. antidiscrimination laws also prevent agencies from approaching prospective candidates because of their backgrounds as Muslims, Arabs, Pakistanis, Iranians, Koreans or Chinese. Agencies instead advertise for skill sets and target schools with relevant programs. The pool of qualified candidates is also small. There are about 6 million people in the United States who speak mission critical languages, but many are not U.S. citizens and others either lack qualifications or are ensconced in high-paying private sector jobs. Sanders and other senior officials said concerns about U.S. security policies have not come up in focus sessions or interviews with Middle Eastern or Asian-American recruits. But officials recognize the need to engage ethnic communities to &#39;demystify&#39; the nature of the intelligence service through meetings with community leaders whom they hope to persuade to encourage people to consider intelligence careers. "In order to be able to recruit from a particular heritage community, we need to have a relationship with that heritage community. You can&#39;t just wander in, set up your recruiting booth and wait for the lines to form," Sanders said. That is good news to Muslims such as Arsalan Iftikhar of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, who says the Bush administration needs to engage ethnic communities more vigorously. "The silver lining is that this divide has slowly begun to close. But there&#39;s still a lot to be done," Iftikhar said. "There is still a misnomer that the war on terror has become a war on Islam. We all know that not to be the case. But it&#39;s important for our administration to take active steps." has made progress using its 56 field offices for outreach efforts in local communities. Thanks partly to that effort, the FBI has received about 1,000 applications in the past few months from people of Middle Eastern or South Asian descent wanting to become agents. FBI officials believe that to be a marked improvement over previous periods but could not provide comparative figures. As a rule, only a small handful out of every 100 agent applicants for positions requiring critical language skills prove fully qualified for the job, the FBI said.

News U.S. officials say Germany threat may involve Kurds By David Morgan and Kristin Roberts WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A threat warning issued by the United States in Germany last month could involve attack plans by an al Qaeda-affiliated group of Kurdish militants, officials said on Friday. U.S. and German authorities said, however, that there was no new threat in Germany beyond the official April 20 State Department warning. They were responding to a report by ABC News on its Web site on Friday that officials believe terrorists were in the advanced planning stages for an attack on U.S. military personnel or tourists in Germany. In the April 20 warning, the U.S. Embassy in Germany encouraged Americans in the country to increase their vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their personal security. "We&#39;re unaware of anything new. We have not changed our force posture," a U.S. defense official said on Friday. In Germany, the Interior Ministry said there had been no change in the security situation. "There is nothing new," a spokesman for the ministry said. "What we&#39;re looking at is the state of affairs that has been long since known. This caused the U.S. authorities to publish a warning to their own citizens in Germany." Counterterrorism officials in Europe and the United States have for weeks been investigating a suspected plot against U.S. interests in the country, which will host a G8 summit of major industrialized countries next month. U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said recent intelligence reports suggested possible involvement by Kurdish Islamists from outside Germany. The group is believed to be affiliated with al Qaeda but not formally a part of the militant network led by , they said. They had no specific information about targets or timing. Some German media reports have suggested involvement by Iraqi militants. However, U.S. officials rejected the notion of a role by Ansar al-Islam, a militant group of Iraqi Kurds and Arabs who have vowed to establish an independent Islamic state in "There is intelligence reporting suggesting there is a group interested in staging an attack, potentially in Germany," said a U.S. official who asked not to be named because the issue involves classified information. "The thinking is that this plot was beyond the talking stage, certainly," the official added. "The concerns are real, but not new." ABC News quoted German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble as saying, "The danger level is high. We are part of the global threat by Islamist terrorism." The ABC report, quoting U.S. and German law enforcement officials, said Patch Barracks, headquarters to the U.S. military&#39;s European Command, could be a target following reports that suspected terrorists had conducted surveillance at the facility. An official with U.S. European Command said there was no new intelligence strong enough to warrant heightened security at military facilities in Germany. "The threat condition has not been raised," the official said. "There&#39;s been no actionable intelligence." German Chancellor Angela Merkel will host the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States at the June 6-8 summit, which will focus on climate change, African poverty and economic cooperation. Schaeuble has said border controls have been tightened ahead of the summit.

News Pope lays out plan to halt sects, names Brazilian saint 1 hour, 45 minutes ago SAO PAULO (AFP) - met with Brazilian bishops on Friday to lay out a blueprint for rebuilding the Catholic Church in its Latin American stronghold after creating Brazil&#39;s first native-born saint. The bishops converged on Sao Paulo&#39;s neo-gothic Cathredral of Se just hours after a million people celebrated as Benedict elevated Franciscan monk Antonio de Sant&#39;Ana Galvao to sainthood at an open-air mass. The Church hopes that naming Galvao as a saint will help reverse the major inroads evangelical faiths have made not only in Brazil, but also across Latin America, home to almost half the world&#39;s population of 1.1 billion Catholics. The event echoed a beatification mass celebrated at the same venue by Benedict&#39;s charismatic predecessor John Paul II in 1980. But unlike John Paul II&#39;s celebration, which resonated with Brazilian music and dance, Friday&#39;s mass canonizing Antonio de Sant&#39;Ana Galvao, a Franciscan monk, followed a sober, classical liturgy. In the speech later to Brazil&#39;s 430 bishops, the 80-year-old German pontiff warned: "No effort should be spared in seeking out those Catholics who have fallen away." Acknowledging that "the present is a difficult time for the Church," the pope spoke of the "worrying disorientation" of society, with marriage and the family under attack and "crimes against life (that) are justified in the name of individual freedom and rights." Within the Church, the pope also lamented the growing questioning of the requirement of priestly celibacy, which he reiterated "is a gift which the Church has received and desires to retain." Benedict said desertions from the Catholic fold were due primarily to the "the lack of an evangelization completely centered on Christ and his Church." He said people who are "insufficiently evangelized (are) most vulnerable to the aggressive proselytizing of (evangelical) sects" adding that such people "are easily influenced because their faith is weak, confused, easily shaken and naive, despite their innate religiosity." Brazil counts some 155 million Catholics, the largest concentration in the world. But in recent years the Church has lost ground to rival evangelical faiths, as well as to a growing number of people who have abandoned religion altogether. In Brazil, 64 percent of the population is Catholic, but the figure has fallen from 74 percent a decade ago, according to a recent study. At the same time, the number of evangelical followers has risen to 17 percent from 11 percent, the Datafolha institute said. Benedict proposed "on every level, a methodical evangelization aimed at personal and communal fidelity to Christ." He added: "What is required, in a word, is a mission of evangelization capable of engaging all the vital energies present in this immense flock." Benedict urged that missionaries be sent "to homes on the outskirts of the cities and in the interior," the two areas where Brazil&#39;s poor are concentrated. "The poor ... need to feel that the Church is close to them, providing for their most urgent needs, defending their rights and working together with them to build a society founded on justice and peace," he said. Benedict also addressed the severe lack of priests in Brazil, where in some places the ratio can be one to 15,000 faithful. While Catholic priests must complete an elaborate seminary education, evangelical pastors need little training. One response to the problem is to train lay ministers to perform certain priestly functions. Friday&#39;s canonization mass was the biggest event in Benedict&#39;s five-day trip to Brazil, which is to end Sunday in the nearby sanctuary town of Aparecida, where he is to open a Latin American bishops&#39; conference. That meeting will also be aimed at giving impetus to the church&#39;s missionary reach in the region.

It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media.

It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object.

It is an optional attribute. is the height of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared.

NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second.

All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/pl_nm/usa_prosecutors_dc	Witness granted immunity in prosecutors probe - Yahoo! News Witness granted immunity in prosecutors probe Fri May 11, 3:53 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former aide to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales received immunity from prosecution on Friday to testify in a congressional probe into the firing last year of federal prosecutors. Lawyers for Monica Goodling, who had served as the Justice Department&#39;s liaison to the White House, said she would appear before the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. "Monica Goodling is a critical witness," said Committee Chairman John Conyers ( ), a Michigan Democrat. "We look forward to hearing her testimony as promptly as possible." A hearing date was not immediately set. Gonzales has told Congress that the firing of eight of the 93 U.S. attorneys last year was justified, but mishandled. He has rejected claims that some may have been ousted to influence politically charged investigations. Goodling resigned earlier this year after Congress began looking into dismissals, and invoked her right against self-incrimination in refusing to testify. The Judiciary Committee voted last month to seek immunity for Goodling, and the chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia signed an order granting it. Under the order, prosecutors would be barred from using Goodling&#39;s testimony to bring a case against her unless she is untruthful.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/pl_nm/guantanamo_lawyers_dc	U.S. drops plans to limit lawyer Guantanamo visits - Yahoo! News U.S. drops plans to limit lawyer Guantanamo visits Fri May 11, 3:24 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Bush administration said on Friday it no longer seeks to limit the number of meetings between Guantanamo prisoners and their lawyers, a proposal that had been strongly criticized by civil liberties and legal groups. Administration attorneys told a U.S. appeals court the Defense Department, which runs the prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, determined the proposed three-visit limit is "no longer warranted," based on "a current evaluation of resources and needs." There have been no restrictions on the number of visits by attorneys with their clients at Guantanamo but last month Justice Department lawyers proposed limiting attorneys with existing clients at Guantanamo to just three visits. Lawyers for the detainees had opposed the proposal for imposing an "arbitrary cap" and called it "antithetical to the attorney-client privilege." Civil liberties and legal groups denounced it for limiting attorney access to their clients. There are about 385 prisoners at the Guantanamo prison. The first prisoners arrived more than five years ago after the United States launched its war on terrorism in response to the September 11 attacks. The indefinite detentions and allegations of prisoner mistreatment at Guantanamo, which the U.S. military denies, have tarnished the U.S. image abroad and a chorus of allies has urged Bush to shut down the camp for foreign terrorism suspects. The administration decision to drop the proposed limit on lawyer visits came ahead of an appeals court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to consider that and other proposed restrictions. Guantanamo prisoners can ask the appeals court to review whether military tribunals have rightfully deemed them to be "an unlawful enemy combatant." Justice Department lawyers said in a six-page court filing that the Defense Department still believes the other proposed restrictions are "warranted and appropriate." One proposal would allow lawyer-client mail to be read by government officials who are not involved in the case. Another proposed restriction would limit defense lawyers&#39; access to classified information that was part of the tribunal record. They would get access only if the U.S. government determined they had a "need to know." The appeals court is considering the procedures to govern the cases brought by the prisoners in light of an anti-terrorism law that President George W. Bush President George W. Bush pushed through Congress last year. That law took away the right of the prisoners to challenge their detention before U.S. district court judges in Washington, resulting in the dismissal of pending cases and a more limited review by the appeals court.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/pl_nm/worldbank_wolfowitz_dc	World Bank board majority want Wolfowitz to resign - Yahoo! News World Bank board majority want Wolfowitz to resign 2 hours, 17 minutes ago WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A majority of countries on the board believe Paul Wolfowitz should resign as President of the World Bank, bank board sources from rich and developing nations said on Friday. "It is now very clear that a majority of members think Mr. Wolfowitz must resign," said one board source from a developing country, which received instructions from its capital this week not to support Wolfowitz&#39;s continued leadership. "We believe that the World Bank cannot continue under the leadership of Mr. Wolfowitz," the source told Reuters. The bank&#39;s 24-nation board this week delayed a final decision until next week over Wolfowitz&#39;s future, which hangs in the balance over a pay and promotion deal he approved for his companion, Shaha Riza, a World Bank Middle East expert. The high-paying promotion sparked calls by the bank&#39;s employee association for Wolfowitz to resign and has paralyzed the institution, the globe&#39;s largest poverty-fighting agency. Wolfowitz has said he took the advice of the board&#39;s ethics committee on Riza and that the row is part of a smear campaign designed to undermine his leadership. Asked how many member countries thought Wolfowitz should resign, the source told Reuters: "More than 50 percent." But another board official from a developed country cautioned that Wolfowitz&#39;s departure was not yet a foregone conclusion and he should be given time to respond properly to findings by a panel that his actions in the Riza&#39;s promotion broke bank rules. He is expected to present his response to the panel by the end of the day today. It was unclear whether the meeting of the board will decide Wolfowitz&#39;s future by consensus or whether it may be forced into a vote, which would be an unusual move. There is concern among some board officials that a vote could further divide the bank by pitting allies of the United States against Europe and its supporters. The official said among the issues being weighed by member countries was whether Wolfowitz&#39;s continued leadership of the World Bank would damage its ability to raise funds for anti-poverty projects, hurt the morale of the staff and further damage the bank&#39;s reputation. The row over Wolfowitz has stirred lingering unhappiness, mainly among European countries, about his nomination to the job in 2005 because of his role as architect of the Despite the private disquiet among Europeans at the time, Wolfowitz&#39;s appointment to the bank was confirmed without dissent on March 31, 2005. He has remained a controversial figure, locking horns with the bank&#39;s membership on such issues as his good governance and anti-corruption campaign. Board sources said Canada and Japan would support the United States in its backing for Wolfowitz together with countries in Africa, where Wolfowitz has focused much of his attention. The sources said Europe&#39;s push for Wolfowitz to resign was supported by Brazil, , India, Russia, Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Exactly where China, Malaysia, Pakistan and Mexico stood remained unclear. The White House has repeated almost daily that U.S. President George W. Bush President George W. Bush has confidence in Wolfowitz, but this week referred the matter to the U.S. , which is responsible for U.S. World Bank policy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has stressed that it is important to preserve the World Bank&#39;s standing in the world and that Wolfowitz deserved a fair process. U.S. Secretary of State has been quietly discussing the issue with her European counterparts as recently as Thursday, according to a European source. Rice&#39;s access to European capitals provides an opportunity for the Bush administration to gauge how serious the opposition is to Wolfowitz&#39;s continued leadership.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_el_pr/giuliani_abortion	Giuliani defends stance on abortion - Yahoo! News Giuliani defends stance on abortion By JOE STINEBAKER, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 7 minutes ago HOUSTON - Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani forcefully reaffirmed his support for abortion rights on Friday and argued that his divergence from conservatives on the issue should not disqualify him from being the eventual GOP nominee. "This is a matter of deep and profound judgment," he said in a speech at Houston Baptist University. "It's a matter of morals. It's a matter of your interpretation of how laws should operate, your interpretation of how respect for the rights of others should operate. But in a country like ours ... I believe you have to respect their viewpoint and give them a level of choice. I would grant women the right to make that choice." The former New York City mayor has struggled in the last week to explain his personal opposition to abortion with his long public record of favoring a woman's right to choose. He has defended his positions &#151; and some say contradictory comments &#151; on late-term abortion, public funding for abortions and the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion. But Giuliani left few questions about his position Friday, telling about 500 students and faculty at the small conservative school that &#151; despite his belief that abortion was "morally wrong" &#151; he believes the decision should ultimately be left to individuals and their decisions should be respected. Opposition to abortion has been a litmus test for conservatives within the Republican Party, who hold considerable sway in the primaries. Giuliani has drawn criticism from some in the GOP for his abortion rights support. One of his rivals, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, has switched from supporting abortion rights to opposing the procedure &#151; a shift that also has drawn complaints. Another rival, Sam Brownback ( ), said Friday that an abortion rights Republican would have trouble winning the nomination. His comments echoed those of another candidate, Sen. John McCain ( "It is a pro-life party, with a pro-choice wing," said the Kansas senator, who spoke during a taping of Iowa Public Television's "Iowa Press" program. "I think he has great trouble winning off of that position." Brownback also criticized Romney's switch. "I do think what will be a deal-breaker is if you flip on core issues like life, taxes, second amendment rights," he said. Giuliani, acknowledging that his position on abortion differed from that of most of his audience, urged them to consider his views on other issues as well before deciding whether to support his candidacy. "You have a right to evaluate this in figuring out if you can support me, and at what level you can support me," Giuliani said. "Everybody's got to make a choice. How important are the differences and then how important are the other issues that are involved in this election?" Giuliani emphasized his conservative credentials on tax cuts, crime and the war in . He said his eight years as mayor of New York showed he could apply conservative social and economic principles even in the face of substantial opposition. HBU President Robert Sloan said the Giuliani campaign called the university on Wednesday and asked if the candidate could speak there this week. Sloan said that, although campaign officials would not discuss why they had chosen HBU, he believed it was because Giuliani "wanted to forthrightly speak on social issues in an audience where religious matters and moral issues truly matter." Several students praised Giuliani's speech, but said it was unlikely to make them support his candidacy. "Overall, I thought it was a great speech," said Erik Mignault, a 25-year-old political science major at HBU. "I agree that we're not going to agree 100 percent with all candidates. I think it was a good political stance to take. He's sitting right in the middle." But Mignault and several other students said they were anti-abortion and likely to support a more conservative GOP candidate. Giuliani's appearance was greeted warmly, and he appeared playful at times, hoisting a child with an "I Love New York" T-shirt and laughing at boos when he spoke of his love for the New York Yankees, the team that this week acquired Houston Astros star pitcher Roger Clemens. But Giuliani told the audience that they should support a candidate who could protect America from terrorism and from Democratic assaults on the economy. He acknowledged that abortion was the issue that most divided them. "I have profound respect for your views," he said. "I have profound respect for your education, and I have profound respect for your religion." But, he said, it is uniquely American to disagree on some political issues while agreeing on many others. "We understand how to respect each other's differences," he said. Associated Press Writer Mike Glover in Johnston, Iowa, contributed to this report.

News Moore blasts Bush over film-trip probe By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Movie Writer LOS ANGELES - Filmmaker has asked the Bush administration to call off an investigation of his trip to Cuba to get treatment for ailing Sept. 11 rescue workers for a segment in his upcoming health-care expose, "Sicko." Moore, who made the hit documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11" assailing 's handling of Sept. 11, said in a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Friday that the White House may have opened the investigation for political reasons. "For five and a half years, the Bush administration has ignored and neglected the heroes of the 9/11 community," Moore said in the letter, which he posted on the liberal Web site Daily Kos. "These heroic first responders have been left to fend for themselves, without coverage and without care. "I understand why the Bush administration is coming after me &#151; I have tried to help the very people they refuse to help, but until George W. Bush outlaws helping your fellow man, I have broken no laws and I have nothing to hide." Harvey Weinstein, whose Weinstein Co. is releasing "Sicko," told The Associated Press the movie is a "healing film" that could bring opponents together over the ills of America's health-care system. "This time, we didn't want the fight, because the movie unites both sides," Weinstein said. "We've shown the movie to Republicans. Both sides of the bench love the film. The pharmaceutical industry won't like the movie. HMOs will try to run us out of town, but that's not relevant to the situation. "The whole campaign this time was not to be incendiary. It was, can Michael Moore bring both sides together?" The health-care industry Moore skewers in "Sicko" was a major contributor to Bush's 2004 re-election campaign and to Republican candidates over the last four years, Moore wrote. "I can understand why that industry's main recipient of its contributions &#151; President Bush &#151; would want to harass, intimidate and potentially prevent this film from having its widest possible audience," Moore wrote. Treasury officials in Washington said Friday they would have no comment on the contents of Moore's letter, citing a policy against discussing specific investigations being conducted by Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the agency that enforces the trade embargo against Cuba. "Generally speaking, as administrators and enforcers of U.S. sanctions, OFAC is required to investigate potential violations of these programs," Treasury spokeswoman AnnMarie Hauser said. "In doing so, OFAC issues hundreds of letters each year asking for additional information when possible sanctions violations have occurred." OFAC notified Moore in a letter dated May 2 that it was conducting a civil investigation for possible violations of the U.S. trade embargo restricting travel to Cuba. Moore questioned the timing of the investigation, noting that "Sicko" premieres May 19 at the and debuts in U.S. theaters June 29. The Bush administration knew of his plans to travel to Cuba since last October, said Moore, who went there in March with about 10 ailing workers involved in the rescue effort at the World Trade Center ruins. Weinstein said the investigation would only help publicize the film. "The timing is amazing. You would think that we originated this. It reads like a fiction best-seller," Weinstein said. The Weinstein Co. said it has hired David Boies, the chief attorney in 's recount battle against Bush in the 2000 presidential election, to help on the "Sicko" case. Cuba on Friday characterized Moore as a victim of censorship and the U.S. trade embargo. The Communist Party daily Granma called the 45-year-old U.S. travel and trade sanctions "a criminal action that has cost lives and grave consequences for the inhabitants of the island," as well as Americans. "Any resemblance to McCarthyism is no coincidence," the newspaper opined, referring to the political witch hunt that U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy carried out against suspected American communists in the 1950s. The U.S. government's targeting of Moore "confirms the imperial philosophy of censorship" by American officials, it added. U.S. State Department officials on Friday declined to comment on Granma's criticisms of the American government and referred calls to the OFAC's letter to Moore noted that he had applied in October 2006 for permission as a full-time journalist to travel to Cuba, but that the agency had not made any determination on his request. The agency gave Moore 20 business days to provide details on his Cuba trip and the names of those who accompanied him. Moore won an Academy Award for best documentary with his 2002 gun-control film "Bowling for Columbine" and scolded Bush in his Oscar acceptance speech as the war in was just getting under way. The investigation has given master promoter Moore another jolt of publicity just before the release of one of his films. "Fahrenheit 9/11" premiered at Cannes in 2004 amid a public quarrel between Moore and the Walt Disney Co., which refused to let subsidiary Miramax release the film because of its political content. Miramax bosses Harvey and Bob Weinstein ended up releasing the film on their own and later left to form the Weinstein Co., distributor of "Sicko." "This is `Fahrenheit' all over again. `Let's pressure somebody.' Last time it was Disney, this time it's direct," Harvey Weinstein said. "Fahrenheit 9/11" won the top prize at Cannes and went on to become the top-grossing documentary ever with $119 million.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/topstories/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/ts_nm/spielberg_darfur_dc	Spielberg joins Hollywood chorus on Darfur - Yahoo! News Spielberg joins Hollywood chorus on Darfur 1 hour, 26 minutes ago LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Director Steven Spielberg on Friday joined the chorus of Hollywood stars seeking an end to killing in the Darfur region of Sudan by calling on China to pressure the African nation into accepting U.N. peacekeepers. Spielberg, the Oscar-winning director of blockbuster films ranging from "Jaws" to "Schindler&#39;s List," released a letter he sent to Chinese President in April saying he recently came to understand China&#39;s strategic support of Sudan. The letter comes at a time when Beijing is preparing for , and some groups and politicians around the world are urging a boycott due to China&#39;s economic ties to Sudan. In his letter, Spielberg notes he will play a role in the Olympic Games as an "artistic advisor." "I add my voice to those who ask that China change its policy toward Sudan and pressure the Sudanese government to accept the entrance of the victims of genocide in Darfur," Spielberg wrote. He asked to meet with Hu, but so far the Chinese president has not responded, said Spielberg&#39;s spokesman, Marvin Levy. Levy said he was certain Hu received and read the letter. Separately on Friday, celebrity couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie issued a statement saying their foundation donated &#36;1 million to agencies working in and around Darfur. But Spielberg&#39;s involvement is new, and in his letter to Hu, the director noted the issue of genocide is especially close to him because of his work with the Los Angeles-based USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education. Spielberg established the foundation to document the plight of Jews under the Nazis, and it has videotaped testimonies of some 52,000 Holocaust survivors from 56 countries to chronicle the atrocities committed against them. Spielberg wrote that the mission of the foundation is "to use those testimonies to overcome intolerance, prejudice, bigotry and the suffering they cause." "We are doing that now in many countries around the world, and I hope that China will someday be one of them," he said. China buys much of Sudan&#39;s oil and has used its veto power to resist sending peacekeepers to the region without the African country&#39;s consent.

News Iraqi officials discourage U.S. pullout By ANNE FLAHERTY, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - Worried Congress' support for is deteriorating rapidly, Baghdad dispatched senior officials to Capitol Hill this week to warn members one-on-one that pulling out U.S. troops would have disastrous consequences. The lobbying push targeted Republicans and Democrats alike, but focused primarily on those considered influential on the war debate. On Thursday, hours before the House voted to limit funds for the war, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh met with more than 30 House Republicans and more than a half-dozen senators, including Sens. Harry Reid ( ), D-Nev., John Warner ( "He understands that American patience is waning," said Sen. Norm Coleman ( ), after eating lunch with Saleh, Iraqi Ambassador Samir Shakir al-Sumaidaie and Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( But the lobbying by the Iraqis isn't the only pressure-point being applied in Washington. Clinton said Friday she considered it "promising" that several Republican House members went to the White House and told they believe the continuing war is adversely affecting the party. She said the GOP lawmakers told Bush pointblank that "he has to change course in Iraq." But she also said she didn't think that Bush was ready to reverse course. "I think we're going to go back and forth on this for a while longer," Clinton said in an interview Friday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program with Joe Scarborough. "It is clear that whatever the mission used to be, it is either accomplished or over," she said. "If there are remaining American interests, then let's spell them out." Baghdad's ability to sell members like Coleman, R-Minn., and Chambliss, R-Ga., on the war effort is critical if the Iraqi government wants U.S. troops to stay. Coleman in recent months has become deeply skeptical of the president's decision to send additional troops to Iraq and says patience on the war in general is limited. Coleman, Chambliss and Sen. John Sununu ( ), R-N.H., who met separately with Saleh, will be up for re-election next year &#151; facing voters who have grown tired of a war in its fifth year and that has killed more than 3,380 troops. While Republicans have been reluctant to intervene, many say President Bush has until September to tell if the troop buildup in Iraq is working before they demand another approach. With the clock ticking, Saleh &#151; a Kurdish politician highly regarded by U.S. officials and who speaks impeccable English &#151; said he came to Capitol Hill to convey the "imperative of success" in Iraq. "Iraq is a central battleground in this historic conflict" against terrorism, he said in a brief interview after meeting with Reid, the Senate majority leader. His trip came on the heels of a visit by Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, along with three other senior advisers, according to the Iraqi embassy. The New York Times first reported al-Rubaie's visit on Tuesday. The timing of these meetings is no mistake. This month, Congress is expected to send Bush legislation that funds the war in Iraq but requires the Baghdad government meet certain political and security reforms. In question is what consequences the Iraqis should face if they fail. Democrats want U.S. troops to leave, Republicans say they don't want to force redeployments, but some say they would be open to withholding more than $5 billion in foreign aid. The House voted 221-205 Thursday for a stronger measure that would fund the war only through July, giving Congress the option of cutting off money after that. The bill is unlikely to survive in the Senate, although it indicates the war's unpopularity among members and their frustration with the lack of progress in the Iraqi parliament. The most recent irritant among U.S. lawmakers was a report that Iraqi officials would break for two months this summer. "Our armed forces are up to 150,000 troops; we're over $600 billion appropriated for this, lost 3,300 lives, 25,000 wounded fellow citizens. ... And the Iraqi answer? We're taking a summer off. Goin' fishing," said Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( Saleh said he expects the vacation to be shortened by at least a month, although nothing had been decided. He added that Iraqis value being independent and do "not take kindly of (U.S. officials) telling us when to recess." Democrats seemed to consider these meetings with Iraqi officials as beneficial &#151; if only to convey their frustration to Iraqi officials in person. Reid's spokesman Jim Manley said the senator told Saleh that "U.S. patience, blood and treasure were not unlimited and that the Congress would be taking a more decisive role in the coming weeks and months." "Salih understood the point, and said he would deliver the message to the Iraqi cabinet," Manley added.

News Romney's estimated wealth in millions By JIM KUHNHENN, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - Republican Mitt Romney is expected to report financial assets between $190 million and $250 million, an amount that would likely make him the wealthiest of the 2008 presidential candidates. Aides to the former Massachusetts governor said his assets have been held in a blind trust that he and his wife set up when he took office in 2002. The adviser who provided the estimate of his assets cautioned that the number is based on 2005 and 2006 financial activity and could amount to a bigger total once the disclosure report is filed later this year. The adviser spoke on condition of anonymity because the totals have not been officially released. The deadline for filing financial disclosures is Tuesday but Romney on Friday obtained an extension. Romney lent his campaign $2 million this year and could clearly tap his wealth again if necessary. Romney is not the wealthiest candidate ever to run for president. , who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination in 1996, had an estimate net worth of more than $430 million. , the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, reported a net worth between $165 million and $235 million in 2005, most of it controlled by his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry. Under federal law, officials who are required to divulge their finances must only list their assets and income in broad ranges, making it impossible to pinpoint their exact wealth. Romney also has a blind trust for his children and grandchildren that is estimated to hold assets between $70 million and $100 million, the adviser said. Those assets do not benefit Romney or his wife and are not required to be reported in federal financial disclosures. Romney has five sons, five daughters-in-law and 10 grandchildren. In 1984, Romney founded Bain Capital, an investment company that helped finance Staples, Domino's Pizza and Brookstone. He then became interim CEO at Bain and Co., the consulting firm where he had worked in the early 1980s. He was credited with pulling Bain and Co., out of financial straits. Romney, 60, also was CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 In the 2008 race, Romney surprised the Republican field by raising more than $20 million for his campaign in the first three months of the year, outpacing GOP front-runners Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, and Arizona Sen. John McCain ( The estimated total is the first glimpse of Romney's wealth since he has been a public official. Aides said his holdings are complicated, spread across partnerships, investment funds and hedge funds. One adviser said obtaining the underlying assets of the hedge fund alone is "a pretty arduous task." Romney received permission Friday from the to delay the official filing of his financial disclosure documents for 45 days beyond Tuesday's deadline. Candidates are entitled to obtain two extensions of up to 45 days each. Most presidential candidates have yet to file their reports. Romney communications director Matt Rhoades said the trustee for Romney's blind trust and "advisers are working diligently to complete the voluminous and complex process and we'll comply with the law." Romney's top rivals, Rudy Giuliani and John McCain, also are wealthy men. McCain, an Arizona senator, amassed most of his money through investments and holdings controlled by his wife, Cindy, an heiress to a major beer distributor, Hensley & Co., founded by her father. Estimates put their net worth at between $20-$32 million. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, earned his fortune from a multitude of business consulting ventures and paid speeches after leaving office. He received $11.4 million in speaking fees in 2006 alone, an average of about $88,000 a speech. , a former trial lawyer, listed his net worth at between $12.8 million and $60 million in 2003, his last report. , in a 2005 Senate financial disclosure, listed her net worth at between $10 million and $50 million.

News Mysterious object probably space junk By JANET FRANKSTON LORIN, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 4 minutes ago NEWARK, N.J. - A mysterious metallic object that crashed through the roof of a New Jersey home earlier this year was not a meteorite after all, but probably a piece of space junk, scientists said Friday. The silvery object was made of a stainless-steel alloy that does not occur in nature and is most likely "orbital debris" &#151; part of a satellite, rocket or some other spacecraft, said Rutgers University geologist Jeremy Delaney. "There's huge amounts of material that have been left by the various space programs of the world," he said. Srinivasan Nageswaran, whose family discovered the object after it crashed through the roof and dented the tile bathroom floor at his home in Freehold Township in January, was disappointed by the news. "That's the nature of science," said the 46-year-old information technology consultant "If the conclusion from the test says it's not a meteorite, then it's not a meteorite. We have to move forward." The object is slightly bigger than a golf ball and about as heavy as a can of soup. Delaney examined it at the police station and initially pronounced it an iron meteorite based on its shape and density. So did other Rutgers geologists and an independent metals expert. But in April, it was taken to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where a new variable-pressure scanning electron microscope was used to establish its composition. "I was wrong," Delaney said. "Sneaky little devil."

News Car bombings kill 23 at Baghdad bridges By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 8 minutes ago BAGHDAD - Twin suicide car bombers struck police checkpoints at bridges in a predominantly Shiite area of Baghdad on Friday, killing at least 23 people just hours after a series of U.S. raids on car bomb networks around the capital killed four suspected insurgents. The blasts underscored the difficulty U.S.-led forces were having in destroying the presumably Sunni insurgent cells that have stepped up car bombings in the capital since the U.S. began its security crackdown 12 weeks ago. "They have actually pushed back," U.S. spokesman Lt. Col. Christopher Garver said, referring to the insurgents. "We've been saying this all along, the enemy is determined." In a sign of that determination, the top U.S. commander in northern said he doesn't have enough troops to crush al-Qaida-led insurgents in Diyala, a province northeast of Baghdad and scene of recent sharp fighting. Maj. Gen. Benjamin R. Mixon had already received extra troops for Diyala and has increased attacks on militants. But he told reporters in a video conference that he has asked Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, the No. 2 commander in Iraq, for more. "I laid out a plan for Gen. Odierno on the numbers of forces that I would need," Mixon said. "We have made progress ... we have taken terrain back from the enemy. Gen. Odierno intends to give me additional forces as they become available." Also Friday, the military announced that two U.S. soldiers were killed in separate bombings the day before. One soldier died in Diyala and the other in Baghdad, the military said. In all, at least 52 Iraqis were killed or found dead Friday in politically related violence. The suicide car bombers struck about 6 p.m. The driver of a sedan waiting in a line of cars at a police checkpoint near the old Diyala Bridge blew up his vehicle, partially collapsing the span, police said. About two minutes later the driver of a large fuel truck barreled toward a second checkpoint at the nearby new Diyala Bridge and set off his explosives, police said. The bridge was also damaged, and firefighters struggled to extinguish burning police and civilian cars that had been driving across during the attack. The blasts sent smoke billowing over the Shiite Zafaraniyah area of southeastern Baghdad. "Suddenly I heard a big explosion, and a huge fire rose from the checkpoint," said Abdullah Khalaf, who was selling sheep by the side of the road when the fuel truck raced past. He ran with his son to the checkpoint and saw the truck and three cars on fire, he said. "I saw one wounded woman asking for help while she was trapped inside a damaged car and three wounded policemen on the ground," he said. "There were pools of blood and pieces of flesh." The bombings at the bridges, which cross the Diyala River, a Tigris tributary, killed 23 people, including 11 police officers, and wounded 57 others, 26 of them police, police said. Baghdad's bridges repeatedly have been targeted by bombers. The most serious had been the April 12 truck bombing that collapsed the steel-girder Sarafiyah bridge, plunging cars into the water and killing 11 people. Two days later, a suicide car bombing killed 10 people at the Jadriyah bridge. Officials say al-Qaida-linked Sunni insurgents are using the bombings to try to provoke retaliatory violence from mainly Shiite militias that had agreed to lay low to avoid confrontations with Americans during the security crackdown. The blasts Friday came despite a series of measures aimed at reducing violence in the capital. U.S. and Iraqi forces have increased checkpoints and, in a bid to prevent bridge attacks, banned trucks capable of carrying more than one ton from crossing without strict searches. They also have long imposed a four-hour weekly driving ban during Friday prayers in Baghdad, but that ban ended on schedule three hours before the attacks. U.S. forces have also tried to break up the insurgent cells behind the bombings. "We have been focusing very heavily on the car bomb factories," Garver said. "We've been targeting the networks and the people that move the bombs and make the bombs as well." In one raid early Friday, troops came under fire as they approached a building near Taji, an air base 12 miles north of Baghdad, suspected of housing a cell responsible for car bomb attacks on civilians and security forces, the military said. The troops returned fire, killing four armed men, including one suspected of being a cell leader with ties to al-Qaida in Iraq's chiefs, the military said. Forces also carried out a series of raids in Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul on Thursday and Friday, detaining nine people suspected of producing bombs and smuggling foreign fighters into the country to carry out attacks against U.S. troops, the military said. In Washington, David Satterfield, Secretary of State 's top adviser for Iraq, said the United States knows for certain that radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr is living next door in "We know he's out of the country, we don't (merely) think" so, Satterfield told The Associated Press, disputing aides to the anti-American religious and political leader.

News Texas mother accused of mutilating baby By JUAN A. LOZANO, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 15 minutes ago HOUSTON - A mother who claimed the family dog tore off her baby son's genitals was arrested Friday and accused of mutilating the boy herself with a sharp instrument. Katherine Nadal, 25, was led away in handcuffs while awaiting a court hearing on custody of the 3-month-old boy, Holden Gothia. She was charged with injury to a child and held on $100,000 bail. Child-welfare authorities said she told social workers she woke up from a nap March 13 to find that her small dachshund had attacked her son. But a veterinarian and a doctor agreed the dog did not cause the injuries, because there was no blood or human tissue on the animal or in its mouth, police said. Police said in court papers that the mother had used a sharp instrument to cut off the boy's genitals. The instrument was not identified. Nadal's attorney had no comment. Nadal had a history of prescription drug abuse and tested positive for cocaine and methadone the day after Holden was mutilated, authorities said. She has been forbidden to see her son since the injuries occurred in March. "Given what we know today, we will probably work toward terminating her parental rights and reuniting the child with his father or another relative," said Harris County Child Protective Services spokeswoman Estella Olguin. The baby has years of reconstructive surgery and other operations ahead of him, said Daniel Sanders, an attorney for Camden Gothia, the baby's father. The dog has since been released by authorities and adopted. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Bombers kill 26 in attacks on Iraqi bridges By Ibon Villelabeitia and Dean Yates 2 hours, 39 minutes ago BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Truck bombs exploded on three important bridges near Baghdad on Friday, killing 26 people and damaging two of the spans in an apparent attempt by insurgents to paralyze road links to the Iraqi capital. The attacks defy efforts by the U.S. military to smash car bomb cells and are the latest in a series of attacks on infrastructure around Baghdad, where U.S. and Iraqi forces have deployed thousands more troops under a three-month-old security plan. In England, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said would need U.S. and British troops for another year or two. "I think in one or two years we will be able to recruit our own army forces and say goodbye to our friends," the president told students in a lecture at Cambridge University. Police said suicide truck bombers struck police checkpoints on two bridges in a Shi&#39;ite area south of Baghdad, killing 22 people and badly damaging one bridge. They said 60 people were wounded. An Iraqi army source said a truck bomb also hit a bridge near the town of Taji just north of Baghdad on the main highway connecting the capital with cities in the north. He said it was quickly followed by a car bomb that killed four soldiers there. The U.S. military said the bridge was impassable for northbound traffic. Last month, a truck bomb destroyed the Sarafiya Bridge in Baghdad. Days later a suicide car bomber blew himself up on a ramp leading to another bridge in the capital, which is bisected by the River Tigris. Politicians from both sides of the Shi&#39;ite-Sunni sectarian divide have accused insurgents of trying to split the capital of seven million people along sectarian lines. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has said his security forces will be ready to take control of the country by the end of this year, but Friday&#39;s attacks illustrate the challenges ahead in trying to drag Iraq back from the brink of sectarian civil war. A police source said eight policemen were among the dead in the attacks on the bridges south of Baghdad, but it was unclear how many casualties were caused by each blast. Police said the first bomber damaged the old Diyala Bridge. Minutes later, a few kilometers (miles) away, another attacker detonated a truck bomb on the new Diyala Bridge. The two bridges over the Diyala River, a tributary of the Tigris, are commonly used by Shi&#39;ite pilgrims on their way to holy Shi&#39;ite cities to the south. In Washington, debate over funding the war moved to the Senate after Democrats in the House of Representatives defied President George W. Bush President George W. Bush on Thursday by passing a bill that allows money to continue combat only for two or three months. Bush vetoed a &#36;124 billion war funding bill last week because it set a deadline for the withdrawal of combat troops. Senators appear more willing to give Bush the &#36;100 billion he wants at once, but it remains unclear how far they might go in setting binding "benchmarks" to measure progress in Iraq. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( ), Democrat of Nevada, said on Friday there was "new reason to believe that a bipartisan consensus on Iraq is emerging." Bush said he would back benchmarks but he and congressional Republicans do not want to spell out actions the United States would take if Iraqi progress in securing the country falls short. U.S. Democrats and some Republicans say Iraq&#39;s Shi&#39;ite government must reach out to minority Sunni Arabs and reduce sectarian violence if it wants U.S. forces to stay. Officials of Iraq&#39;s most powerful Shi&#39;ite party said on Friday it would make key changes to its platform, in a move that will increasingly align it with Iraq&#39;s top Shi&#39;ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. The changes could also distance the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) from neighboring Shi&#39;ite , where the party was formed in the 1980s to oppose the late President Underscoring the strain on U.S. forces as the Baghdad buildup nears its peak, one commander said he needed more troops in volatile Diyala province north of the city. "I do not have enough soldiers right now in Diyala province to get that security situation moving," said Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, commander of forces in areas north of Baghdad.

News Cheney warns Iran to keep sea lanes open By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 7 minutes ago ABOARD USS JOHN C. STENNIS - From an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, Vice President on Friday the U.S. and its allies will keep it from restricting sea traffic as well as from developing nuclear weapons. "We'll keep the sea lanes open," Cheney said from the hangar deck of the USS John C. Stennis as it steamed about 150 miles from the Iranian coast. Cheney is touring the Middle East asking Arab allies to do more to help and to curb Iran's growing power in the region. With Iraq in turmoil, both Iran and Saudi Arabia are maneuvering to see who can help fill the leadership vacuum. The vice president made clear the United States' intentions on the rivalry. "We'll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region," he said. On Saturday, Cheney will make a fence-mending visit to Saudi Arabia. The oil-rich kingdom, long a key American ally in the Middle East, recently has been shunning the U.S.-supported government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, suggesting he is too close to Iran. Roughly a quarter of the world's oil supplies pass through the narrow Straits of Hormuz connecting the Persian Gulf with the open waters of the Arabian Sea. Iran controls the eastern side of the straits. With two U.S. carrier groups now in the region, the vice president declared, "We're sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike. We'll keep the sea lanes open." The carrier was in the Gulf about 20 miles off Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Cheney is spending time there after a two-day tour of Iraq. Standing in front of five F18 Super Hornet fighters and a huge American flag in the cavernous hangar deck &#151; one flight below the carrier's flight deck &#151; Cheney sounded a hard line both on holding firm in Iraq and confronting Iran if necessary. Just over four years after stood on another aircraft carrier beneath a "Mission Accomplished" banner and declared an end to major combat, Cheney had a far more subdued message. "We want to complete the mission, get it done right, and return with honor," he told Stennis crew members. Officials said that between 3,500 and 4,000 of the carrier's 5,000 sailors and Marines stood in sweltering heat &#151; hovering over 100 degrees &#151; to hear Cheney speak. "It's not easy to serve in this part of the world. It's a place of tension and many conflicts," said Cheney. "We'll stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats. We'll disrupt attacks on our own forces," he added. U.S. officials have said that some of the sophisticated roadside bombs used against U.S. troops in Iraq have come from Iran. After returning from the carrier, Cheney had dinner with Emirates Crown Prince Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. On Saturday, before leaving for Saudi Arabia, Cheney is expected to press Emirates President Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan to support U.S. efforts in Iraq and to shut down Iranian companies in his country that U.S. officials believe are backing Iran's nuclear development. Some 500,000 Iranians live in the Emirates. Cheney's visit comes just two days before Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is to visit Abu Dhabi. Ahmadinejad wants the Emirates and other Gulf Arab countries to drop their military alliances with Washington and join Iran in regional efforts. The United States has about 40,000 troops on land bases in Gulf countries outside Iraq and about 20,000 sailors and Marines in the region. No Gulf state has yet backed Iran's offer of an alliance. Iran's top nuclear negotiator said Friday that a compromise over its nuclear program was impossible if the West continued to demand Tehran suspend uranium enrichment, Iran's state broadcasting company reported on its Web site. Ali Larijani's comments came a day after the U.S. and France took Iran to task during a conference on nuclear proliferation for defying a demand that it freeze enrichment. "If the West again applies the past wordings about Iran's nuclear case, this issue will not conclude," the Web site quoted Larijani as saying. "They should abandon this idea that they can change conditions of Iran's nuclear case by applying harsh word policy." When he goes to Saudi Arabia on Saturday, Cheney faces a difficult diplomatic mission &#151; trying to ease concerns of King Abdullah about the direction of al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government in Iraq. Abdullah has increasingly sent signals that he doubts the U.S. troop buildup to help secure Baghdad will work. The king refused to see al-Maliki as the Iraqi prime minister was making a tour of Arab countries late last month. And during a regional conference in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik in early May, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister was one of the few Arab diplomats al-Maliki did not meet in face-to-face talks. Abdullah's snub to al-Maliki appeared aimed at showing Saudi Arabia's concern that the Iraqi government is too close to Iran and is not doing enough to reconcile with Iraq's Sunni Arab minority, a Saudi official said at the time. Iran, like Iraq, is heavily Shiite. Saudi Arabia has a predominantly Sunni Muslim population. The visit to the Stennis was a return trip for Cheney, who came to the carrier &#151; then in the Arabian Sea &#151; in March 2002 as he was trying to build support in the area for invading Iraq. Cheney flew to and from the carrier Friday by helicopter.
