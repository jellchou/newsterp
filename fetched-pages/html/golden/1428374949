http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/south_asia/6643953.stm	BBC NEWS | World | South Asia | Uttar Pradesh low caste landslide Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 17:13 GMT 18:13 UK E-mail this to a friend Uttar Pradesh low caste landslide BSP supporters see their party set for government India's low-caste Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has swept to a historic victory in assembly elections in the key northern state of Uttar Pradesh. With all but a handful of results declared, the BSP had won 202 of the 403 seats to allow it to form its own government, Indian media reports said. It is the first time since 1991 that any party in the state has done so. Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state and has long been its most politically influential. I thank people of all castes and communities who supported my party Blow to economic reform? The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says the result represents a major setback for India's mainstream political parties who faired poorly in polls which observers believe could help determine India's political future. He says many believe it is significant that BSP leader Ms Mayawati - a fiery politician from the poor, deprived Dalit (formerly untouchable) caste - has managed to spread her political appeal and that it may not be long before India votes in a lower caste prime minister. Jubilant, flag-waving BSP supporters gathered on Friday outside Ms Mayawati's residence in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. Mayawati is a Dalit, at the bottom of the caste system Dancing party supporters set off fire crackers and celebrated with sweets. Ms Mayawati now begins her fourth term in office, but hers will not this time be a coalition government. "I thank people of all castes and communities who supported my party to achieve this overwhelming victory," she told a news conference. Outgoing chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had earlier admitted defeat and resigned. His Samajwadi Party came a poor second, far behind the BSP. India's two main political parties - the governing Congress and the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - also did very badly. Both have been on the decline in Uttar Pradesh in recent years. The poor Congress showing came despite a high-profile campaign by Rahul Gandhi - the fourth generation of the famous dynasty. Former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has admitted defeat Ms Mayawati's support base is mostly with the lower caste and poor communities who form a significant percentage of the Uttar Pradesh electorate. The elections were held in seven phases over a month for logistical reasons. None of the phases had a turnout higher than 50%. The vote will also be remembered for having seen no significant violence, unlike in the past. Caste and religion have been dominant factors in politics over the past two decades in Uttar Pradesh, one of India's poorest states. Uttar Pradesh is also plagued by corruption, and lags behind other parts of India in areas like development and health. Because of its sheer size and numbers, Uttar Pradesh, commonly called UP, holds an important place in the Indian political system. More than 49 million people were eligible to vote at nearly 50,000 polling stations in Uttar Pradesh, watched over by thousands of police and paramilitary troops. The state has more than 175 million inhabitants. It sends 80 MPs - the highest number in India - to the federal parliament, more than any other state. It has produced most of India's prime ministers, including the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6641329.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Asia-Pacific | Ramos-Horta 'wins E Timor poll' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 12:22 GMT 13:22 UK E-mail this to a friend Ramos-Horta 'wins E Timor poll' Mr Ramos-Horta (r) is an ally of the outgoing president (l) Nobel prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta is on course to be East Timor's next president, bringing congratulations from Australia and New Zealand. Election officials said Mr Ramos-Horta had won nearly 70% of the vote, but the official result has yet to be declared. His rival, Francisco "Lu Olo" Guterres, has conceded defeat. Although Mr Ramos-Horta has not yet formally declared victory, he has already made a speech vowing to heal the wounds of the troubled nation. Australian Prime Minister John Howard was among the first to offer his congratulations to Mr Ramos-Horta, whom he called "a person of great dedication and... a good friend of Australia". New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said he hoped to work with Mr Ramos-Horta "in the difficult task of strengthening [East Timor's] young and fragile democracy". Mr Ramos-Horta, the current prime minister, is widely seen as more friendly with the West than Mr Guterres, of the ruling Fretilin party, who often takes a more leftist, nationalist line. The election commission said on Friday that, with all the ballots counted, Mr Ramos-Horta had taken 69% of the vote and Mr Guterres 31%. Founder of East Timor's independence movement Spent 24 years in exile after Indonesia invaded Won Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 Former journalist, fluent in five languages The final result is expected to be officially released later after it has been given court approval, a commission spokeswoman said. Mr Ramos-Horta said the result was not a cause of celebration, but the start of five years of hard work ahead. "I will honour what I told the people in the campaign: I will work for the poor, with the entire country, to unite it, and heal its wounds," he said. Mr Guterres conceded defeat, telling reporters he would "bow to the will of the people" and "do everything possible to support Ramos-Horta". The result is a blow to the left-wing Fretilin party, which has been a major force in East Timor politics. Fretilin appears to have fallen out of favour with voters since last year's violence between rival security forces, which resulted in street battles that left more than 30 dead and tens of thousands homeless. The party will have a fight on its hands to stay in government in next month's parliamentary elections, a correspondent in Jakarta says. The outgoing president Xanana Gusmao - an ally of Mr Ramos-Horta who has led the nation since it won independence five years ago, after breaking free from decades of Indonesian rule in 1999 - plans to run for the more powerful position of prime minister in the election. Observers hailed Wednesday's run-off as peaceful and free of intimidation - in contrast to the first round, which was marred by irregularities and fighting between rival supporters. This has raised hopes that the vote may prove to be a turning point for the impoverished and violence-wracked nation.

Official documents will list everybody who has owned any piece of land in the five years before its development. Senior local government officials will also have to declare their assets. A number of local officials have been arrested recently on allegations of fraud, money laundering and corruption linked to housing projects. In one of the biggest cases, nearly 60 people were arrested in the southern resort of Marbella, including a former mayor, several councillors, developers, art dealers and even a well-known singer. The government hopes that reducing the number of speculators and the degree of corruption will bring down prices. "With the instruments of this law we should put the brakes on exorbitant house prices," said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. The new law also reserves 30% of future property development for social housing and allows for planning decisions taken over the past two years to be reviewed under certain circumstances. It will come into force on 1 July, a few days after municipal and regional elections are held in Spain.

The plan, which has yet to receive final approval, would involve building about 20,000 homes. The Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said the plan destroyed efforts to re-start the peace process. He said Israel had to choose between settlements or peace, but could not have both. Yehoshua Pollak, Jerusalem's deputy mayor, said the intention was to create a contiguous Jewish residential area linking East Jerusalem with major West Bank settlement blocs. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since 1967. It annexed the area in 1981 and sees it as its exclusive domain. This has not been recognised by the international community. Palestinians hope to establish the capital of their future state in the East Jerusalem.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6639385.stm	BBC NEWS | Programmes | From Our Own Correspondent | A letter from Iraq to Tony Blair Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 13:59 GMT 14:59 UK E-mail this to a friend A letter from Iraq to Tony Blair One issue threatens to overshadow Tony Blair's legacy, affecting his image and standing at home and abroad, the decision to go to war in Iraq. Even at the time of Saddam's fall, people were wary of the future I have never written to a politician in my life. But I very nearly made an exception for Tony Blair. It was towards the end of 2002, when it was already clear that the invasion of Iraq was only a matter of time. I found myself deeply torn. I had no illusions about the nature of Saddam Hussein. I had followed his brutal antics for years. I had been to his Iraq, and felt the all-pervasive fear instilled by his vigilant and ruthless police state. What a relief it was to get on the plane and feel that oppressive weight lifted off your shoulders, an experience that most Iraqis were denied. But when Saddam's excesses were at their worst, during the war with Iran in the 1980s, he was actually being discreetly supported by the Americans. Washington was turning a blind eye to human rights reports from its own State Department detailing how Iraqi children were being tortured in front of their parents to get them to confess or inform. In 1988, when the Iraqi air force dropped chemical bombs which killed thousands of Kurds at Halabja, I remember phoning the Pentagon, and being told: "We think it was the Iranians who did it." So on a personal level, I would be glad to see the end of Saddam Hussein and his harsh dictatorship. It was clear, long before it happened, that this was going to be a terrible mess. It had to be But the impending invasion was clearly not about to happen because he was a bad man. It might be the right thing, but it was being done for the wrong reasons - reasons that had more to do with the global ambitions of the ascendant neo-conservatives in Washington, and their desire to engineer a New Order in the Middle East. The chosen pretexts for the war - Saddam's alleged weapons of mass destruction and links with international terror - turned out to be simply invalid. I have often thought, over these past four years, of that regular cartoon slot in the satirical magazine Private Eye, entitled "Things We Seldom See". It features situations which would be blindingly logical, but just never happen. I wanted to propose one where President Bush addresses Saddam Hussein and says: "Mr Hussein, you were right. There were no weapons of mass destruction, and no links with terrorism. We'd like to apologise, and give you your country back." Apart from misgivings about Washington's real motives and objectives, it was clear, long before it happened, that this was going to be a terrible mess. It had to be. Iraq is a patchwork country, an ethnic and confessional cocktail, of Arabs and Kurds, Turkomans and Chaldaeans, Sunnis and Shiites. Iraq has been plagued with civil unrest and violence Such countries are usually held together by a strong centralised dictatorship, which could be benign or tyrannical. As soon as you admit the concept of democracy and take the lid off, it is bound to be difficult and chaotic in the best of conditions, in a place with no democratic traditions or culture. To blow the regime and all its control mechanisms away virtually overnight, through the massive use of force by people from halfway around the world, would inevitably plunge the country and the region into a long period of chaos, whatever exact form it would take. That is why I lay sleepless in my bed in Tehran, mentally composing that letter to Tony Blair that I never wrote. I was going to tell him, on the basis of three decades living and working in the region, that he was on the brink of a massive historical blunder. I never sent it, because I knew of course that it would not make a blind bit of difference, apart from perhaps salving my own conscience, and allowing me to say: "I told you so" - something that would bring no satisfaction at all. And so, four years on, look at what a terrible mess Mr Blair can now say goodbye to, and hand on to Gordon Brown. Where there used to be tight state control, there is massive terrorism on a daily basis. The Americans have been bombing Baghdad again, to quell Sunni militants and Shiite militias. At the end of the day, the British are minor players, politically important partners brought in on the coat-tails of the Americans They are building walls to separate districts, euphemistically calling them "gated communities". Millions of Iraqis have fled the country. In the south, British troops are trying to stifle Shiite militias which know they only have to wait, because the British will be gone before long. A transition of leadership in London is not going to make much difference on the ground in Iraq. Gordon Brown will be locked into a situation which he might or might not have chosen to get into in the first place, but will now be stuck with, and his options will be limited. At the end of the day, the British are minor players, politically important partners brought in on the coat-tails of the Americans. It is the outcome of their last-ditch struggle to control Baghdad and central Iraq that is crucial to the country's future. If it does not work, the coalition troops may start pulling out and we may find that Iraq's long nightmare has only just begun.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/uk/6646537.stm	BBC NEWS | UK | 11 Menezes police face no action Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 13:57 GMT 14:57 UK E-mail this to a friend 11 Menezes police face no action Mr Menezes was mistaken for a suicide bomber Eleven officers involved in the shooting of Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes will not face disciplinary action, the police watchdog has said. They were among 15 Metropolitan Police officers interviewed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Decisions have not been made on the four most senior officers investigated. The family of Mr Menezes - shot eight times at Stockwell Tube station after being mistaken for a suicide bomber - said the decision was "disgraceful". The 27-year-old was killed on 22 July 2005, one day after the failed London bombings. The IPCC said a surveillance officer, one of the 11 not facing disciplinary action, would be given "management advice" in relation to action he took after the shooting. It is a travesty of justice and another slap in the face for our family Patricia da Silva Armani, Mr Menezes' cousin It said a decision on whether the four commanders and tactical advisers investigated should be disciplined would be made after the end of court proceedings. The Crown Prosecution Service previously found no evidence to warrant the prosecution of any individual over the shooting of Mr Menezes, an electrician. However, Scotland Yard is facing prosecution under health and safety laws over the incident. The trial is due to start in October. Patricia da Silva Armani, Mr Menezes' cousin, said: "It is a travesty of justice and another slap in the face for our family. "The police officers' lives go on as normal while we exist in turmoil, fighting to get the answers and justice we deserve." The Justice4Jean Campaign questioned the decision to clear the officers before the health and safety case is brought. "This is entirely premature and, worse still, may potentially prejudice any future criminal proceedings," a spokesman said. The grief and anger of his family is entirely understandable and - as I have been powerfully reminded - remains unassuaged IPCC chairman Nick Hardwick "This sends out the signal that no action against officers will ever be taken in this case, which is devastating for the family." The Menezes family said they believed there were grounds for gross negligence manslaughter criminal charges against the four senior officers. A spokeswoman, speaking on their behalf, said: "We hope ultimately that all the officers about whom evidence emerges of wrongdoing that led to this wrongful death are ultimately rendered fully accountable," the spokeswoman added. The IPCC's chairman, Nick Hardwick, said he understood the feelings of Mr Menezes' family. "The grief and anger of his family is entirely understandable and - as I have been powerfully reminded - remains unassuaged," he said. "I would not do anything lightly that adds to that grief or anger." But he said although Mr Menezes was "entirely innocent" there was "no realistic prospect" of disciplinary charges being upheld against the firearms or surveillance officers involved, including the two officers directly responsible for the fatal shooting . They were facing the "challenge" of the wake of the 7/7 London bombings, he added. The human rights group, Liberty, condemned the delay in deciding whether the more senior officers should be punished. The Metropolitan Police welcomed the IPCC recommendation but said the shooting of Mr Menezes was "a matter of very deep regret" to the service and said its thoughts were "with his family". A spokesman added: "There is no doubt that the events of July 2005 brought significant challenges to the Met and during this time many officers operated under difficult and dangerous conditions to protect London and Londoners."

The Red Cross has confirmed the news, saying Eric Damfreville was handed over to them on Friday evening. There is no news on the fate of three Afghans also abducted by the Taleban in south-west Afghanistan. A French woman, Celine Cordelier, who was kidnapped at the same time, was released on 28 April. The aid workers were employed by the French group Terre d'enfance (A World for our Children). Taleban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf told the BBC Pashto service that the French man was freed in the Maiwand district of Kandahar, the same area where Ms Cordelier was freed. Mr Yousuf said the Taleban had freed Mr Damfreville because French President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy intended to withdraw French troops from Afghanistan. Mr Sarkozy indicated in April he was not committed to keeping French troops in Afghanistan. "It was certainly useful that we sent (the troops) in the context of the war against terrorism, but the long-term presence of French troops in that part of the world does not seem to me to be decisive," he said, Reuters news agency reports.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6645555.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Americas | Pope creates Brazil's first saint Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 15:57 GMT 16:57 UK E-mail this to a friend Pope creates Brazil's first saint Believers from across Latin America cheered and waved flags Pope Benedict XVI has canonised Brazil's first native-born saint, Friar Galvao, to the cheers of up to a million faithful gathered in Sao Paulo. The Pope announced the sainthood from a throne flanked by bishops and choirs, and overlooked by a giant wooden cross. The Church has attributed two miracles to Friar Galvao, an 18th Century monk who is still seen as influential. The open-air Mass marks the highlight of the Pope's five-day visit to the world's most populous Catholic nation. Hundreds of thousands of believers from across Latin America cheered and waved flags at Sao Paulo's Campo de Marte airfield. Many had spent the night there. The BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo says the huge turn-out demonstrates that the Catholic Church remains a powerful force in Brazil. Brazil's first native-born saint Lived from 1739 to 1822 Credited by church with 5,000 miracle cures Founded monasteries and convents in Brazil Profile: Saint Antonio Galvao Pope visit: Reporter's diary In pictures: Pope in Brazil During the Mass, the 80-year-old pontiff encouraged his listeners to follow the example of the new saint by helping the needy "in an age so full of hedonism". He lauded Friar Galvao as a model of rectitude and humility, and went on to criticise the elements of the media that ridiculed the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage. After canonising Friar Galvao, the Pope also hugged Sandra Grossi de Almeida and her seven-year-old son, Enzo. She is one of two Brazilian females who the Church says are evidence of divinely inspired miracles that justify Friar Galvao's sainthood. Friar Galvao is remembered for producing Latin prayers written on tiny balls of paper that, when swallowed, had the apparent effect of curing a range of ailments. After taking one of these pills, Ms Almeida, who had a uterine malformation that should have made it impossible for her to carry a child for more than four months, gave birth to Enzo. Friar Galvao is also certified by the Church as healing a four-year-old girl said to have been considered incurable by doctors. I hope Pope Benedict XVI can help to resurrect our Brazilian Catholic identity Philippe Gebara, Rio de Janeiro Send us your comments Following the Mass, the Pope was due to meet some 430 Brazilian bishops at a Sao Paulo cathedral. Another highlight of the Pope's trip comes on Sunday, when a crowd of at least 350,000 people is expected to celebrate Mass in Aparecida, where the Pope will also take part in a conference of Latin American bishops. The forum, the first for 15 years, will bring together nearly 200 bishops and cardinals from Latin America and the Caribbean to set out the Church's agenda and future policies in the region. 'Sheep without a shepherd' On Thursday, the Pope received a rapturous reception from an audience of tens of thousands of young people gathered at a Sao Paulo stadium. Brazilians give their views on the Pope's stance on abortion and contraception His address focused on what he called the "snares of evil" - pre-marital sex, drug use, corruption, violence and the temptations of wealth and power. He urged the young to avoid these and asked them to "be promoters of life, from its beginning to its natural end". The Pope sparked controversy as soon as he arrived in Brazil on Wednesday by stressing his strong opposition to abortion, the subject of intense debate in the country, where some Brazilians are pushing for the legalisation of terminations. The World Health Organisation estimates that illegal abortions numbered more than a million in Brazil last year alone.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6641329.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Asia-Pacific | Ramos-Horta 'wins E Timor poll' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 12:22 GMT 13:22 UK E-mail this to a friend Ramos-Horta 'wins E Timor poll' Mr Ramos-Horta (r) is an ally of the outgoing president (l) Nobel prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta is on course to be East Timor's next president, bringing congratulations from Australia and New Zealand. Election officials said Mr Ramos-Horta had won nearly 70% of the vote, but the official result has yet to be declared. His rival, Francisco "Lu Olo" Guterres, has conceded defeat. Although Mr Ramos-Horta has not yet formally declared victory, he has already made a speech vowing to heal the wounds of the troubled nation. Australian Prime Minister John Howard was among the first to offer his congratulations to Mr Ramos-Horta, whom he called "a person of great dedication and... a good friend of Australia". New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said he hoped to work with Mr Ramos-Horta "in the difficult task of strengthening [East Timor's] young and fragile democracy". Mr Ramos-Horta, the current prime minister, is widely seen as more friendly with the West than Mr Guterres, of the ruling Fretilin party, who often takes a more leftist, nationalist line. The election commission said on Friday that, with all the ballots counted, Mr Ramos-Horta had taken 69% of the vote and Mr Guterres 31%. Founder of East Timor's independence movement Spent 24 years in exile after Indonesia invaded Won Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 Former journalist, fluent in five languages The final result is expected to be officially released later after it has been given court approval, a commission spokeswoman said. Mr Ramos-Horta said the result was not a cause of celebration, but the start of five years of hard work ahead. "I will honour what I told the people in the campaign: I will work for the poor, with the entire country, to unite it, and heal its wounds," he said. Mr Guterres conceded defeat, telling reporters he would "bow to the will of the people" and "do everything possible to support Ramos-Horta". The result is a blow to the left-wing Fretilin party, which has been a major force in East Timor politics. Fretilin appears to have fallen out of favour with voters since last year's violence between rival security forces, which resulted in street battles that left more than 30 dead and tens of thousands homeless. The party will have a fight on its hands to stay in government in next month's parliamentary elections, a correspondent in Jakarta says. The outgoing president Xanana Gusmao - an ally of Mr Ramos-Horta who has led the nation since it won independence five years ago, after breaking free from decades of Indonesian rule in 1999 - plans to run for the more powerful position of prime minister in the election. Observers hailed Wednesday's run-off as peaceful and free of intimidation - in contrast to the first round, which was marred by irregularities and fighting between rival supporters. This has raised hopes that the vote may prove to be a turning point for the impoverished and violence-wracked nation.

The company outbid state-run Rosneft - the expected winner - by offering four times the opening bid. The move marks the end of once-dominant Yukos, whose assets are being sold to pay off $26bn in tax bills imposed after fraud investigations. On Thursday, an offshoot of Rosneft bought Yukos' last production assets. Rosneft bought the last outstanding refining and production asset of Yukos - Samaraneftegaz - at auction for 165.5bn roubles. The starting price at Friday's auction which included the 22-storey Moscow headquarters, as well as various subsidiary outfits, had been 22bn roubles. It had been widely thought Rosneft - which has been buying up Yukos assets for several years - would buy the headquarters. By buying Yukos assets including its three main production units -Yuganskneftegaz, Tomskneft and Samaraneftegaz - Rosneft now owns more than 40% of Russia's oil production. Thursday also saw 537 Yukos petrol stations sold at an auction, to energy firm Yuniteks. As well as facing huge debts, Yukos former chief executive and founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky was jailed for tax evasion. Yukos has argued that the tax demands made by the government were tied to a political campaign against Mr Khodorkovsky, who is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence in Siberia. Russia's government started breaking up Yukos in 2003 after Mr Khodorkovsky was sent to prison.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6647799.stm	BBC NEWS | World | South Asia | Karachi braced for judge protests Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 16:27 GMT 17:27 UK E-mail this to a friend Karachi braced for judge protests Thousands of security personnel are deployed in the city At least one person has been killed and more than 100 arrested ahead of rallies over Pakistan's continuing judicial crisis in the southern city of Karachi. Demonstrations are planned for Saturday when Pakistan's ousted top judge is due to address his supporters in the city. Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry was suspended by President Musharraf in March. He denies abuse of power. The suspension triggered protests by lawyers and the opposition which have grown into an anti-government campaign. Observers say anger over the judge's suspension poses the biggest challenge to Gen Musharraf's rule since he seized power in 1999. The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Karachi, capital of Sindh province, says lawyers there plan a massive reception for the chief justice on Saturday. I assure you the MQM will follow the law to the letter Lawyer's house shot at Opposition political parties - including the six-party MMA Islamic alliance and the country's largest party, the Pakistan People's Party - are also expected to participate. The ruling party in Sindh, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), has said it will hold rival demonstrations in support of President Musharraf's government on the same day. More than 15,000 security personnel have been deployed in the city to prevent violence. Late on Friday morning, a security guard was shot dead by armed men forcibly closing down a shopping centre on Karachi's main thoroughfare, Shahrah-e-Faisal. Mr Chaudhry was suspended from his post in March Earlier, police arrested scores of political activists and raided homes across the city. "We have detained over 100 people who are a risk to security on 12 May," Azhar Farooqi, the city police chief, told the BBC. "We are monitoring the situation and there may be more arrests required." The city and provincial police are controlled by the home department which is headed by a minister from the MQM. But the party leadership denies that it has used the state machinery to help keep the opposition in line. "I assure you the MQM will follow the law to the letter and never indulge in such tactics," Dr Farooq Sattar, a senior MQM leader, told the BBC. He described such suggestions as "last resort propaganda". Both sides have refused to reschedule their rallies, and the lawyers have accused the provincial government of using intimidatory tactics. Ahead of the 12 May rallies, Munir Malik, a leader of the lawyers' campaign to have the chief justice reinstated, had his offices sealed by local building officials. The courts later suspended the move. Hours later, his home was attacked by unidentified gunmen. Since then there has been a visible increase in tensions in Karachi, which has a long history of political violence, our correspondent says.

The deal was reached between the caretaker Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica, and President Boris Tadic, according to TV reports. Mr Tadic had set Friday as the deadline for a new prime minister to be named. If a government is not formed by 14 May, the president is obliged to call new elections. Earlier this week a hardline nationalist, Tomislav Nikolic, was elected parliamentary speaker, prompting fears that Serbia could abandon the road to reform. But he has now said he will resign because a new government is being formed. The parties have been wrangling over who will control the key ministries of defence and the interior, as well as the intelligence services. The nationalist Radicals became the largest party in parliament in the January election. But no party has enough seats to govern alone. Reports said President Tadic, whose Democratic Party is the most pro-Western, would take charge of the national security council, responsible for the hunt for the fugitive Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. The agreement involves the Democratic Party, Mr Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), G-17 and New Serbia. The BBC's Nick Hawton in Belgrade says the new government will have to tackle the difficult Kosovo issue. The UN Security Council is currently discussing a plan which would give the Serbian province a form of independence demanded by its majority Albanian population. Serbian leaders are opposed to the plan.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6647005.stm	BBC NEWS | World | South Asia | US admits Afghan civilians killed Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 16:44 GMT 17:44 UK E-mail this to a friend US admits Afghan civilians killed US forces said they called in air support US-led forces have admitted civilians were killed in fighting with Taleban insurgents this week in the southern Afghan province of Helmand. Local officials say at least 21 people died when US-led forces called in air strikes against militants near Sangin. In turn, a local elder ordered the killing of a Taleban commander for ambushing the US-led ground forces and triggering the air strikes. The fighting, near the town of Sangin, has been continuing. One child, who was evacuated to a Coalition medical treatment facility nearby, later died of wounds "There are confirmed reports of civilian casualties; however, it is unknown... how many," a statement from US-led coalition troops said. It said up to 20 wounded villagers had been treated by coalition forces. It is the third time in recent months that US special forces, who operate outside Nato remit, have been accused of causing significant civilian casualties. Public discontent in Afghanistan is growing over the rising number of civilian casualties and the government's failure to improve the lives of most Afghans. The US military say they called in air strikes on Tuesday night after US special forces and Afghan troops came under mortar, rocket and small arms fire while on patrol 25km (15 miles) north of Sangin. Senate urges Taleban talks Civilian deaths 'shame' US The aircraft destroyed "three enemy command and control compounds", spokesmen said on Wednesday. They said troops had killed a "significant" number of militants. Locals said villages had been hit, and children and women were among the dead. One villager quoted by Reuters news agency denied Taleban fighters had used them as "human shields". However, in the aftermath of the battle, a Taleban commander, Haji Wali Mohammad, was killed at the orders of a local elder who criticised his men for using local people's homes to fight from. The elder said that by ambushing the Americans, the Taleban had brought the bombs to the villages. The elder was then killed in retaliation by other Taleban fighters, according to reports from local people. There are more than 11,000 US troops in Afghanistan outside of the Nato mandate who are involved in counter terrorism and training the Afghan security forces. The US-led coalition statement on Friday said a joint inquiry into the incident was being conducted with the Afghan army. It said a wounded child had died after being evacuated by the coalition for treatment. Foreign forces and Afghan troops are trying to drive militants from the lawless, opium-producing region of Sangin. The rising number of civilian casualties there and elsewhere in the country is putting President Hamid Karzai under increasing pressure. On Tuesday, the Afghan Senate urged him to open direct talks with local Taleban militants, and for attacks on them to stop. Earlier that day, the US military had said it was "deeply ashamed" over the killings of 19 Afghan civilians by US Marines in early March. Correspondents say that casualties in remote battle sites in Afghanistan are almost impossible to verify. Taleban fighters are often accused of seeking shelter in peoples' homes, leading to civilian casualties, and it is often difficult to determine if people killed in such air strikes were militants or civilians.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6646055.stm	BBC SPORT | Motorsport | Formula One | Alonso bounces back to set pace Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation F1 on Five Live>> Friday, 11 May 2007, 13:42 GMT 14:42 UK E-mail this to a friend Alonso bounces back to set pace Alonso is determined to win his home Grand Prix Fernando Alonso underlined how much he wants to win his home Spanish Grand Prix with the fastest time in practice. The world champion bounced back after being beaten by team-mate Lewis Hamilton in Friday's first session to dominate practice in the afternoon. Alonso set a best lap of one minute 21.397 seconds to beat Hamilton, who was fifth, by 0.791secs. The Renaults of Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen were second and third, ahead of Ferrari's Felipe Massa. Hamilton improved by only 0.1secs over his morning time, while Alonso found nearly 0.9secs. Your views on the Spanish Grand Prix In the morning session, Alonso, who was outpaced by his rookie team-mate at the last race in Bahrain, set the early pace in 1:22.449, with Hamilton just behind. Both drivers improved their times on their second series of laps, but this time Hamilton was just over 0.1secs faster than the world champion. The 22-year-old improved his time again, by nearly 0.3secs on his third run, whereas Alonso did not go any faster, but the Spaniard was still clear of the Ferraris. Schumacher is attending his first GP since his retirement By the end of the afternoon Hamilton was sandwiched between the two Ferraris, with Kimi Raikkonen in sixth place, suggesting another close battle between F1's two dominant teams. The pace of the Renaults appears not to be indicative of a major step forward after their disappointing start to the season, according to Fisichella. "My feeling is that we are possibly a little bit closer to the cars in front of us," the Italian said, "even if we are clearly not fast enough to be second in the times on speed alone." Kovalainen added: "The target has to be to qualify in the top 10 but, just like at the last three races, it is going to be tough." Jenson Button continued to struggle in the Honda, managing only the 13th fastest time in the afternoon, just ahead of team-mate Rubens Barrichello. Button was 10th fastest in the morning, when he was nearly half a second down on Anthony Davidson's Super Aguri, which is effectively Honda's 2006 car.

Hundreds of gaily-dressed performers enacted scenes from the 1857 uprising to recreate a sense of history at the Red Fort in the capital, Delhi. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the crowd that the revolt was "a shining example of our national unity". It is known in India as the first war of India's independence, while in the UK it is usually called a mutiny. At the majestic 17th Century Red Fort, the celebrations began early on Friday morning. Scenes from the uprising were enacted before an audience that comprised the entire Indian leadership, including the president and the prime minister. Some historians say the rebellion was the first war of independence "There is no doubt that 1857 was a shining example of our national unity," Prime Minister Singh said, addressing the crowds from the Red Fort. "Our war of independence was based on unity in diversity and today our national unity is also based on this. "This is our strength and this is our destiny." It was in Delhi 150 years ago that hundreds of Indian soldiers breached the city walls and swore allegiance to the last Mogul emperor, setting off a brutal uprising that lasted for months. The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says the government is projecting the event as one of unity, an occasion when Hindus and Muslims rose as one against the British. But he says that many of Friday's performers were drawn from parts of India that had nothing to do with the uprising, such as the south and the north-east. Our correspondent says it is an illustration of the ambiguity that surrounds the event, with some arguing that it was far too localised to be characterised as a war of independence. Others say it was too violent in a country that eventually won its independence after a non-violent struggle. Security has been tight across the city. Thousands of policemen and soldiers were deployed to ensure the event passed off peacefully. Schools, colleges and many offices were closed for the occasion and traffic on the streets was thin. Thousands of people, who have been retracing the steps of the Indian soldiers who marched from Meerut town to Delhi 150 years ago, reached the capital on Thursday night. Speaking in parliament on Thursday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urged India to honour the memory of the rebels. "As a nation inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's message of non-violence, India has consciously abjured violence as an instrument of social and political change," Mr Singh said. "Yet we cannot forget those inspired revolutionaries - many of them anonymous to history - who sacrificed their lives in 1857 to free the country from foreign yoke," he said. The uprising began when native Hindu and Muslim soldiers, known as sepoys, revolted against the British East India Company over fears that new gun cartridges were greased with animal fat forbidden by their religions. The rebellion was eventually crushed by the British. On Monday, thousands of people began marching towards the capital in a colourful procession. Around 10,000 people retraced the march that dozens of mutinous Indian soldiers undertook from the garrison town of Meerut in a bid to capture Delhi. Many of the marchers were dressed like Indian soldiers and British officers and staged mock fights with swords and muskets on top of colourful floats. They carried huge banners and posters with messages referring to the revolt, which left many British and Indians dead. Although the uprising was crushed, historians say it laid the seeds of a popular revolt against British occupation which culminated in full independence. After suppressing the revolt, the British captured Delhi and exiled the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, to Rangoon in Burma. He died in captivity five years later. The revolt ended the British East India Company's rule in India, making way for direct rule by the British government until 1947, when the country gained independence.

Jalal Talabani was addressing students during a visit to Cambridge University. Asked when the UK and US should leave, he said: "I think in one or two years we will be able to recruit our own army forces and say goodbye to our friends." He added that he considered Prime Minister Tony Blair to be a "hero" and said he hoped Gordon Brown would continue his work. After a meeting with Mr Blair at 10 Downing Street, Mr Talabani said Mr Blair was a "dear friend" and a "great leader". I think it was a very noble job that your army and your people did in Iraq The Iraqi president expressed his sympathy towards the families of British forces killed in his country, who he said had died for a just cause. He said: "I am very, very sorry for the lives lost in Iraq." "I think it was a very noble job that your army and your people did in Iraq." Mr Talabani urged American politicians to reconsider plans to begin withdrawing their forces from his country. On Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed a draft bill that would provide funding for troops in Iraq only until July. Mr Talabani told reporters: "We are concerned.

Local officials say at least 21 people died when US-led forces called in air strikes against militants near Sangin. In turn, a local elder ordered the killing of a Taleban commander for ambushing the US-led ground forces and triggering the air strikes. The fighting, near the town of Sangin, has been continuing. One child, who was evacuated to a Coalition medical treatment facility nearby, later died of wounds "There are confirmed reports of civilian casualties; however, it is unknown... how many," a statement from US-led coalition troops said. It said up to 20 wounded villagers had been treated by coalition forces. It is the third time in recent months that US special forces, who operate outside Nato remit, have been accused of causing significant civilian casualties. Public discontent in Afghanistan is growing over the rising number of civilian casualties and the government's failure to improve the lives of most Afghans. The US military say they called in air strikes on Tuesday night after US special forces and Afghan troops came under mortar, rocket and small arms fire while on patrol 25km (15 miles) north of Sangin. Senate urges Taleban talks Civilian deaths 'shame' US The aircraft destroyed "three enemy command and control compounds", spokesmen said on Wednesday. They said troops had killed a "significant" number of militants. Locals said villages had been hit, and children and women were among the dead. One villager quoted by Reuters news agency denied Taleban fighters had used them as "human shields". However, in the aftermath of the battle, a Taleban commander, Haji Wali Mohammad, was killed at the orders of a local elder who criticised his men for using local people's homes to fight from. The elder said that by ambushing the Americans, the Taleban had brought the bombs to the villages. The elder was then killed in retaliation by other Taleban fighters, according to reports from local people. There are more than 11,000 US troops in Afghanistan outside of the Nato mandate who are involved in counter terrorism and training the Afghan security forces. The US-led coalition statement on Friday said a joint inquiry into the incident was being conducted with the Afghan army. It said a wounded child had died after being evacuated by the coalition for treatment. Foreign forces and Afghan troops are trying to drive militants from the lawless, opium-producing region of Sangin. The rising number of civilian casualties there and elsewhere in the country is putting President Hamid Karzai under increasing pressure. On Tuesday, the Afghan Senate urged him to open direct talks with local Taleban militants, and for attacks on them to stop. Earlier that day, the US military had said it was "deeply ashamed" over the killings of 19 Afghan civilians by US Marines in early March. Correspondents say that casualties in remote battle sites in Afghanistan are almost impossible to verify. Taleban fighters are often accused of seeking shelter in peoples' homes, leading to civilian casualties, and it is often difficult to determine if people killed in such air strikes were militants or civilians.

Mr Blair and Mr Chirac have disagreed regularly on EU matters over the years but greeted each other warmly on the Elysee Palace steps. Their biggest falling out came when Mr Blair allied with Washington over Iraq. Mr Blair also held talks with French President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy, who takes power on 16 May. The meeting was Mr Sarkozy's first with a foreign leader and was expected to be followed by a private dinner. During the talks they were joined by Francois Fillon, expected to be named next week as Mr Sarkozy's prime minister, and British ambassador to France, Peter Westmacott. Previously, Mr Sarkozy expressed his personal admiration for Tony Blair and his political style, as well as for his government's economic record. On one of his last visits to Britain, Mr Sarkozy visited a job centre to see how the UK dealt with unemployment. I am tempted to say that Sarkozy is currently the most successful Blairite around BBC Europe editor Mark Mardell Europe diary: Blair's friends He has made the fight against joblessness his top priority for France. The main subject of Mr Blair and Mr Sarkozy's talks was expected to be Europe and the future of the EU Constitutional Treaty - which France scuppered by voting against, in its referendum two years ago. Mr Sarkozy wants, instead, a pragmatic form of mini-treaty, pared down to its bare essentials, to be voted through national parliaments rather than risk another referendum. However, Britain and France still disagree on some areas, not least over Turkish membership of the EU, which Britain favours and Mr Sarkozy remains firmly against. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is working on a roadmap towards a new treaty to be discussed at the European Council meeting in late June. She is not expected to meet the new French president for talks until after 16 May.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/australia/6645531.stm	BBC SPORT | Cricket | International Teams | Australia | ICC pressed for Zimbabwe action Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Friday, 11 May 2007, 07:06 GMT 08:06 UK E-mail this to a friend ICC pressed for Zimbabwe action Australia last played Zimbabwe in a World Cup warm-up game in St Vincent Australian prime minister John Howard has stepped up his campaign to persuade the International Cricket Council to take action against Zimbabwe. Cricket Australia is facing a US $2m fine if it pulls out of a one-day series in Zimbabwe later this year. But Howard said: "Our over-riding objective is the tour not take place. "How long can the international cricket community go on doing things that give aid and comfort to someone who has been totally impervious to any entreaties?" The prime minister described Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe as a "grubby dictator" who had sanctioned violence to try and silence his political opponents. "I am jammed between my distaste for the government getting involved in something like this and my even greater distaste for giving a propaganda victory to Robert Mugabe," he added. The Australian team is due to play three one-day internationals in Zimbabwe in September and the only way their governing body could escape a financial penalty for cancelling the tour would be if the decision was taken because of security concerns. The government is, however, investigating whether there would be a legal basis for it to intervene and prohibit the tour. Foreign minister Alexander Downer met officials from Cricket Australia and the players' union, the ACA, in Melbourne on Thursday. Afterwards, Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland said they understood "very clearly" the government's preference for the team not to undertake the tour. But he added: "Cricket Australia is also conscious of world cricket's requirements that each country visit all other nations regularly as part of the ICC's Future Tours Program. Cricket Australia is strongly committed to the global development of cricket." Australia last played in Zimbabwe in 2004, a tour which was boycotted by spin bowler Stuart MacGill, and he has already spoken out about this year's proposed series. The ICC, meanwhile, issued a statement earlier this week in which it claimed it was "not a party" to the Future Tours Program Agreement between the 10 full member countries. "A member that does not comply with its obligation to tour another member is subject to a penalty of a minimum of US $2m or such greater amount that the host member can prove to have lost as a result of the failure to tour. "This is not an ICC fine. It is a contractual obligation between the respective members and if a member fails to fulfil that obligation, then it would have to pay the member against which it is defaulting," the statement continued.

They come from the Dutch government archives and include the testimony of a 27-year-old Dutch woman from May 1946. The Kyodo news agency says the documents show women were coerced into prostitution in occupied Indonesia. Japan's PM Shinzo Abe had claimed no evidence existed to prove that women had been forced to work as sex slaves. The documents are reported to have been found by a Japanese journalist investigating Japan's wartime crimes in Asia. The Dutch woman's testimony says she had her clothes ripped off her by Japanese military police. She says she was taken to a brothel and forced to work as a prostitute, despite her efforts to resist. That testimony, it is claimed, was submitted to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as evidence of forced mass prostitution in Magelang, in what is now Central Java, in 1944. Other documents are said to include further allegations that the Japanese forced women into prostitution. Earlier this year Prime Minister Abe said that investigations had failed to find any documentary evidence that the Japanese authorities in wartime had issued orders to soldiers to coerce women into sex slavery. He said though that he stood by a Japanese government apology to the women, known in Japan as "comfort women". The journalist who found these documents says they contradict the prime minister's denial that the authorities were directly involved in coercion. The Japanese Foreign Ministry says it is aware of his claims but has not seen the documents so cannot comment on what they might contain. It says the Japanese government has investigated its wartime activities in Indonesia thoroughly and acknowledges and apologises for the country's wartime use of sex slaves.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6643953.stm	BBC NEWS | World | South Asia | Uttar Pradesh low caste landslide Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 17:13 GMT 18:13 UK E-mail this to a friend Uttar Pradesh low caste landslide BSP supporters see their party set for government India's low-caste Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has swept to a historic victory in assembly elections in the key northern state of Uttar Pradesh. With all but a handful of results declared, the BSP had won 202 of the 403 seats to allow it to form its own government, Indian media reports said. It is the first time since 1991 that any party in the state has done so. Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state and has long been its most politically influential. I thank people of all castes and communities who supported my party Blow to economic reform? The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says the result represents a major setback for India's mainstream political parties who faired poorly in polls which observers believe could help determine India's political future. He says many believe it is significant that BSP leader Ms Mayawati - a fiery politician from the poor, deprived Dalit (formerly untouchable) caste - has managed to spread her political appeal and that it may not be long before India votes in a lower caste prime minister. Jubilant, flag-waving BSP supporters gathered on Friday outside Ms Mayawati's residence in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. Mayawati is a Dalit, at the bottom of the caste system Dancing party supporters set off fire crackers and celebrated with sweets. Ms Mayawati now begins her fourth term in office, but hers will not this time be a coalition government. "I thank people of all castes and communities who supported my party to achieve this overwhelming victory," she told a news conference. Outgoing chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had earlier admitted defeat and resigned. His Samajwadi Party came a poor second, far behind the BSP. India's two main political parties - the governing Congress and the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - also did very badly. Both have been on the decline in Uttar Pradesh in recent years. The poor Congress showing came despite a high-profile campaign by Rahul Gandhi - the fourth generation of the famous dynasty. Former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has admitted defeat Ms Mayawati's support base is mostly with the lower caste and poor communities who form a significant percentage of the Uttar Pradesh electorate. The elections were held in seven phases over a month for logistical reasons. None of the phases had a turnout higher than 50%. The vote will also be remembered for having seen no significant violence, unlike in the past. Caste and religion have been dominant factors in politics over the past two decades in Uttar Pradesh, one of India's poorest states. Uttar Pradesh is also plagued by corruption, and lags behind other parts of India in areas like development and health. Because of its sheer size and numbers, Uttar Pradesh, commonly called UP, holds an important place in the Indian political system. More than 49 million people were eligible to vote at nearly 50,000 polling stations in Uttar Pradesh, watched over by thousands of police and paramilitary troops.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6644717.stm	BBC NEWS | Politics | Brown makes pitch to lead Britain Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 15:45 GMT 16:45 UK E-mail this to a friend Brown makes pitch to lead Britain Gordon Brown said he had the "new ideas and vision" to govern Britain as he launched his long-awaited campaign to lead Labour and become prime minister. He praised Tony Blair and said he wanted to make the UK "one of the great success stories of the new century". But the launch suffered a hitch with Mr Brown's face obscured on TV coverage of his speech by glass autocues. Mr Blair earlier endorsed Mr Brown's bid to succeed him as prime minister, saying "he has what it takes". I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place - where I will always strive to be - and that is on people's side What will he do as PM? Launching his campaign at the Imagination Gallery in central London, Mr Brown said Mr Blair "has led our country for ten years with distinction - with courage, passion and insight". But he added: "In the weeks and months ahead, my task is to show I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people." Mr Brown said he welcomed challenges from other leadership contenders and pledged to lead a government "of all the talents," refusing to rule out employing ministers from other parties. Was that really him behind those plate glass windows? Standing in front of his campaign logo, "Gordon Brown for Britain", Mr Brown pledged to tour the country to "listen and learn" about people's concerns. "I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place - where I will always strive to be - and that is on people's side," he said. He rejected Conservative calls for a snap election, saying the Tories did not call for an election in 1990, when Margaret Thatcher stood down. He also denied he would move the government to the left, saying he would continue to "drive forward" New Labour reforms to the public services. But he said he wanted to strengthen Britain's constitution and give more power to MPs. "One of my first acts as prime minister would be to restore power to Parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy. "Government must be more open and more accountable to Parliament - for example in decisions about peace and war, in public appointments and in a new ministerial code of conduct." He can make a real difference to this country for the better and for the good In Full: Brown's speech Media: 'Iraq tarnished Blair' Mr Brown also suggested Britain could get its first written constitution, saying: "We need a constitution that is clear about the rights and responsibilities of being a citizen in Britain today." On Iraq, Mr Brown said: "I accept that mistakes have been made." He said he would be visiting Britain's troops and "listening to what the government of Iraq says". Later, in a speech in Knebworth, in Hertfordshire, Mr Brown promised to create a "new kind of politics" in which the government "gives power away so that people in the community can have more power". He said the challenge facing the government was to "create a strong society" to go with Britain's "strong economy". Mr Brown is the firm favourite to succeed Mr Blair when he quits on 27 June. He could still face a challenge from one of two left-wing backbenchers but there appears to be a coordinated effort among Labour MPs to unite behind him, with Blairite MPs Stephen Byers and Alan Milburn also expected to back him. I feel like Brown has been snuck in through the back door Send us your comments Mr Blair, who until now has held back from endorsing Mr Brown's bid to replace him, said: "I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labour Party and as prime minister and to endorse him fully." He added: "He has shown, as perhaps the most successful chancellor in our country's history, that he's got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great prime minister." But shadow chancellor George Osborne, for the Conservatives, said Mr Brown as chancellor had been "responsible for the failures of the past 10 years". "When you look at the things people are really fed up with, like the collapse of the pension system, like the failure to get money to the frontline of the health service, Gordon Brown is more responsible for that than any other politician including Tony Blair," Mr Osborne told BBC News 24. Q&A: What happens now? Analysis: Blair's exit message Referring to Labour's heavy election losses last week, he added: "I don't see how he could be the change that the country wants and the country voted for." Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vincent Cable said Mr Brown had focused too much on improving his image and criticised his "presidential" style. He added: "When he has tried to change his personality for PR purposes, it's been excruciatingly embarrassing... I think he's much better off being himself." Mr Brown is spending the day touring marginal Labour seats which the Tories are targeting. Commons leader Jack Straw, Mr Brown's campaign manager, said he wanted to "reach out" to the voters in the South-East of England that had brought Labour to power in 1997. Mr Straw also denied suggestions there would be a cooling in relations between Downing Street and Washington under a Brown premiership. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Gordon Brown and George Bush don't know each other anywhere nearly as well as Tony Blair and George Bush. That relationship will develop." Backbenchers Michael Meacher and John McDonnell are still trying to muster enough support between them to mount a leadership bid. They will meet on Monday - when nominations officially open - and the one with the fewest confirmed backers will stand aside.

"What has sustainable development to do with human rights?" Zimbabwe's ambassador to the UN told the BBC. The position traditionally rotates through the regions of the world, with Africa next in line. But some countries say Zimbabwe's high inflation, unemployment and rights record make it an unsuitable candidate. European countries in particular are calling on African nations to put forward another candidate. Zimbabwe's ambassador to the UN, Boniface Chidyausiku, said his country was entitled to hold the chairmanship. When they tell the African group to change, it's an insult to our intelligence "It's our right. We're members of the United Nations and we're members of CSD, and the Africa group did make a decision and endorsed Zimbabwe," he told the BBC's Network Africa programme. "They're making a storm out of a teacup." He said the real objection came down to Britain's criticism of Zimbabwe's controversial land reform programme. Zimbabwe's food production has plummeted since land reforms in 2000 that saw thousands of white-owned farms seized. "We see it as a translation of a bilateral quarrel between London and Harare on the land reform programme," Mr Chidyausiku said. He said the European countries should respect the decision of the African block. "When they tell the African group to change, it's an insult to our intelligence - that we Africans can't think," he said. Meanwhile, Mozambique has threatened to cut electricity to its neighbour for failing to pay its debts. Mozambique's Cahora Bassa dam supplies Zimbabwe with 500 megawatts of power. The BBC's Jose Tembe in Maputo says Zimbabwe has accumulated debt to the tune of $9m. A spokesman for Mozambique's electricity firm EDM said the government acknowledged Zimbabwe's current economic crisis but said that debt is debt and must be paid. On Wednesday, it was announced that households in Zimbabwe were to be limited to four hours' electricity a day, between 1700 and 2100 local time.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6644151.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Asia-Pacific | Koreas agree cross-border train Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 11:58 GMT 12:58 UK E-mail this to a friend Koreas agree cross-border train The South wants to secure future border crossings North and South Korea have ended four days of high-level military talks with agreement on cross-border train tests and the disputed western sea border. In a joint statement the two sides said they had agreed to provide security guarantees for a rail test-run across the border planned for next week. They also agreed to create a joint fishing zone in the West Sea, the scene of bloody naval clashes in the past. Analysts say the deal is a significant breakthrough for the two Koreas. South Korea has long sought security guarantees from the North for a train to cross the heavily fortified border. The test-run, scheduled for 17 May, will see the first such crossing since rail links between the two were severed during the 1950-53 Korean War. Tracks have been reconnected - alongside roads - as part of recent reconciliation projects. "The two sides have decided to discuss the issue of adopting a statement of agreement on military security for the operations of railways and roads," the joint statement said. If the test goes ahead, a train will cross from the North on the east coast and another will cross from the South on the west coast, officials said. They will travel about 25km (16 miles) and terminate their journeys a few kilometres inside the opposite territory. However, the north has resisted demands to allow further crossings after that. The talks by generals in the truce village of Panmunjom were extended into a fourth day so they could seek a resolution to the disputed maritime border, Yonhap news agency reported. Pyongyang does not recognise the border drawn by the United Nations at the end of the Korean War, which has resulted in naval clashes over the rich fishing grounds. Previous talks on cross-border trains have collapsed because of the North's insistence that the sea border issue be discussed. "The two sides have shared the view that preventing military conflict and creating a joint fishing zone in the West Sea is an issue to be urgently resolved in the course of easing military tension and establishing peace," Friday's joint statement read. This is the latest in a series of relationships that have slowly been re-established between the two sides in recent years, as the South has sought to engage with the secretive neighbour it is still technically at war with. A rail link would bring advantages to both sides. For South Korea, it would mean easily transporting goods produced using cheap North Korean labour. Seoul hopes one day to connect its rail network to the Trans-Siberian railway, which runs from China through to Europe. The line would boost tourism for the North by providing a link to a mountain resort on the east coast popular with South Koreans.

The company outbid state-run Rosneft - the expected winner - by offering four times the opening bid. The move marks the end of once-dominant Yukos, whose assets are being sold to pay off $26bn in tax bills imposed after fraud investigations. On Thursday, an offshoot of Rosneft bought Yukos' last production assets. Rosneft bought the last outstanding refining and production asset of Yukos - Samaraneftegaz - at auction for 165.5bn roubles. The starting price at Friday's auction which included the 22-storey Moscow headquarters, as well as various subsidiary outfits, had been 22bn roubles. It had been widely thought Rosneft - which has been buying up Yukos assets for several years - would buy the headquarters. By buying Yukos assets including its three main production units -Yuganskneftegaz, Tomskneft and Samaraneftegaz - Rosneft now owns more than 40% of Russia's oil production. Thursday also saw 537 Yukos petrol stations sold at an auction, to energy firm Yuniteks. As well as facing huge debts, Yukos former chief executive and founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky was jailed for tax evasion. Yukos has argued that the tax demands made by the government were tied to a political campaign against Mr Khodorkovsky, who is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence in Siberia. Russia's government started breaking up Yukos in 2003 after Mr Khodorkovsky was sent to prison.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6646537.stm	BBC NEWS | UK | 11 Menezes police face no action Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 13:57 GMT 14:57 UK E-mail this to a friend 11 Menezes police face no action Mr Menezes was mistaken for a suicide bomber Eleven officers involved in the shooting of Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes will not face disciplinary action, the police watchdog has said. They were among 15 Metropolitan Police officers interviewed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Decisions have not been made on the four most senior officers investigated. The family of Mr Menezes - shot eight times at Stockwell Tube station after being mistaken for a suicide bomber - said the decision was "disgraceful". The 27-year-old was killed on 22 July 2005, one day after the failed London bombings. The IPCC said a surveillance officer, one of the 11 not facing disciplinary action, would be given "management advice" in relation to action he took after the shooting. It is a travesty of justice and another slap in the face for our family Patricia da Silva Armani, Mr Menezes' cousin It said a decision on whether the four commanders and tactical advisers investigated should be disciplined would be made after the end of court proceedings. The Crown Prosecution Service previously found no evidence to warrant the prosecution of any individual over the shooting of Mr Menezes, an electrician. However, Scotland Yard is facing prosecution under health and safety laws over the incident. The trial is due to start in October. Patricia da Silva Armani, Mr Menezes' cousin, said: "It is a travesty of justice and another slap in the face for our family. "The police officers' lives go on as normal while we exist in turmoil, fighting to get the answers and justice we deserve." The Justice4Jean Campaign questioned the decision to clear the officers before the health and safety case is brought. "This is entirely premature and, worse still, may potentially prejudice any future criminal proceedings," a spokesman said. The grief and anger of his family is entirely understandable and - as I have been powerfully reminded - remains unassuaged IPCC chairman Nick Hardwick "This sends out the signal that no action against officers will ever be taken in this case, which is devastating for the family." The Menezes family said they believed there were grounds for gross negligence manslaughter criminal charges against the four senior officers. A spokeswoman, speaking on their behalf, said: "We hope ultimately that all the officers about whom evidence emerges of wrongdoing that led to this wrongful death are ultimately rendered fully accountable," the spokeswoman added. The IPCC's chairman, Nick Hardwick, said he understood the feelings of Mr Menezes' family. "The grief and anger of his family is entirely understandable and - as I have been powerfully reminded - remains unassuaged," he said. "I would not do anything lightly that adds to that grief or anger." But he said although Mr Menezes was "entirely innocent" there was "no realistic prospect" of disciplinary charges being upheld against the firearms or surveillance officers involved, including the two officers directly responsible for the fatal shooting . They were facing the "challenge" of the wake of the 7/7 London bombings, he added. The human rights group, Liberty, condemned the delay in deciding whether the more senior officers should be punished. The Metropolitan Police welcomed the IPCC recommendation but said the shooting of Mr Menezes was "a matter of very deep regret" to the service and said its thoughts were "with his family". A spokesman added: "There is no doubt that the events of July 2005 brought significant challenges to the Met and during this time many officers operated under difficult and dangerous conditions to protect London and Londoners."

Mr Blair and Mr Chirac have disagreed regularly on EU matters over the years but greeted each other warmly on the Elysee Palace steps. Their biggest falling out came when Mr Blair allied with Washington over Iraq. Mr Blair also held talks with French President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy, who takes power on 16 May. The meeting was Mr Sarkozy's first with a foreign leader and was expected to be followed by a private dinner. During the talks they were joined by Francois Fillon, expected to be named next week as Mr Sarkozy's prime minister, and British ambassador to France, Peter Westmacott. Previously, Mr Sarkozy expressed his personal admiration for Tony Blair and his political style, as well as for his government's economic record. On one of his last visits to Britain, Mr Sarkozy visited a job centre to see how the UK dealt with unemployment. I am tempted to say that Sarkozy is currently the most successful Blairite around BBC Europe editor Mark Mardell Europe diary: Blair's friends He has made the fight against joblessness his top priority for France. The main subject of Mr Blair and Mr Sarkozy's talks was expected to be Europe and the future of the EU Constitutional Treaty - which France scuppered by voting against, in its referendum two years ago. Mr Sarkozy wants, instead, a pragmatic form of mini-treaty, pared down to its bare essentials, to be voted through national parliaments rather than risk another referendum. However, Britain and France still disagree on some areas, not least over Turkish membership of the EU, which Britain favours and Mr Sarkozy remains firmly against. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is working on a roadmap towards a new treaty to be discussed at the European Council meeting in late June. She is not expected to meet the new French president for talks until after 16 May.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6647195.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Africa | Guinea soldiers suspend protest Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 16:19 GMT 17:19 UK E-mail this to a friend Guinea soldiers suspend protest Soldiers say they were promised a pay rise after a 1996 army mutiny Soldiers in Guinea who marched on the capital have agreed to return to barracks after the president promised to meet them about their unpaid wages. The meeting is scheduled for Saturday and comes after a week of army unrest. A BBC correspondent in Conakry says there has been an air of panic in the city as soldiers took to the streets firing shots in the air. On Thursday, a civilian was shot dead and eight injured when soldiers opened fire in the southern town of Gueckedou. The protests began last week when the soldiers alleged President Lansana Conte had gone back on his pledge to increase their wages after an army mutiny in 1996. Guinea was the scene of violent protests earlier this year as people called for the ailing president to step down. A three-week general strike ended after a military crackdown and the appointment of a consensus prime minister. The BBC's Alhassan Sillah in Conakry says the situation remains very tense. [Prime Minister] Kouyate cannot solve the situation by asking the bank to print some money The soldiers marched into the city centre to the army headquarters. Shops and market stalls closed as people rushed to get home and pick their children up from school. At the height of the stand-off, two government radio stations went off air. There were also reports of disturbances in Kindia and Mamou in the east and Macenta in the south. Last week, a spokesman for the aggrieved soldiers told the BBC they wanted their promised 11-year salary arrears paid. He also said they wanted the resignation of senior military officials including the army chief, Gen Kelfala Camara, and the new Defence Minister, Arafan Camara. Guinea analyst Gilles Yabi, from the International Crisis Group, says these events do not come as a surprise. The deal emerged after days of intense negotiation "Even in the middle of demonstrations in January and February there were signs of discontent within the military... it was not connected to the political situation, it was really because of their conditions," he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. "The soldiers want to be rewarded for the loyalty they've maintained towards President Lansana Conte," he said. But Mr Yabi said it puts the new prime minister, Lansana Kouyate, in a very difficult position. He was appointed to curb inflation and bring in badly needed economic reforms. "That means that Kouyate cannot solve the situation by asking the bank to print some money," Mr Yabi said. Although Guinea's mineral wealth makes it potentially one of Africa's richest countries, its people are among the poorest in West Africa. Mr Conte seized power in a bloodless coup in 1984 and in 2003 won a third term in a poll boycotted by the opposition.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6625393.stm	BBC NEWS | Programmes | From Our Own Correspondent | Making a public splash in Saudi Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Saturday, 5 May 2007, 11:03 GMT 12:03 UK E-mail this to a friend Making a public splash in Saudi BBC News, Saudi Arabia A new university for women is opening in Riyadh - yet Saudi Arabia remains a country where women cannot vote, drive, dress as they like or go where they please. The women of Saudi Arabia are not just folded away behind swathes of hot black cloth - they live segregated lives When I moved to the Middle East six months ago, I knew I would have to bid farewell to my arms and legs. But I was happy to be working in the region, so I did not resent having to put my skirts and dresses into storage. But as I prepared for my first trip to Saudi Arabia, I was bristling at the thought of having to wear an abaya - the all-enveloping black cloak that turns the women of the Gulf into mournful ghosts. Perhaps that is why I called the hotel before I arrived, to ask a question I already knew the answer to - will I be able to use the swimming pool? The response was a small silence, and then an embarrassed laugh. "Er, No madam. The pool is, of course, for men only. I am so sorry." I have to congratulate you, Madam, I think you are the first woman to swim in public in all Saudi Arabia The women of Saudi Arabia are not just folded away behind swathes of hot black cloth, they live segregated lives, ushered out of the all-male public spaces into so called "family" areas, escorted everywhere by husbands or male relatives, and expected to ask for male permission to travel. So the idea of women swimming in public was laughable. Undeterred, I wrote a slightly uppity e-mail to the manager of the hotel, protesting that whatever discrimination I expected in the country, I didn't expect it in an international hotel, and asking how he could justify charging me the same price for a lesser service. I suggested that he could arrange a single sex time for women to swim. I even offered to swim in my abaya. To my surprise, he agreed to my request. The pool would be mine between six and seven in the morning. So, wishing I had someone to witness me swimming in cloak and goggles, I arrived for my swim, at dawn. The night manager of the leisure centre, Walid, was waiting for me, in a state of nervous excitement. "Good morning Madam," he said. "We have everything ready for you. We have cordoned off the pool, placed screens all around." "So if you have everything you need I shall lock you out here so that you won't be disturbed." He paused for a moment with his keys, and fixed me with a conspiratorial look. "I have to congratulate you, Madam, I think you are the first woman to swim in public in all Saudi Arabia!" Saudi leaders say women will be allowed to vote in 2009 I grinned. "A small revolution?" I asked. "No a big revolution. I don't think you realise how big," he said, shaking his head in amazement. "So since you've screened it all off, does that mean I don't have to wear an abaya?" I asked. "You can wear what you want," he said, smiling, "No-one can see you." I didn't feel this was the moment to point out that I was swimming in the open air, at the foot of the tallest building in the country. There was a 41-storey skyscraper looking down upon this scandal. I couldn't help but gaze up at it between lengths, and giggle. Later that day I met an impressive woman of the Gulf called Haya Rashed al Khalifa. Haya is one of Bahrain's first female lawyers, and currently the President of the United Nations General Assembly. She was in Riyadh to address a gathering of Arab heads of state; an unusual occasion in a region where female politicians are still an unfamiliar sight. The first nationwide elections only took place here two years ago. Women were not allowed to vote, let alone stand as candidates. But Haya told the rows of men seated in front of her that they could not avoid change any longer. The right to swim comes a long way down the list of demands of the women in Saudi Arabia - well below the right to vote, or the right to drive a car It was time, she told the Arab leaders, that they recognised that women are part of the human race. Meeting Haya later, I told her I was struck by her optimism. This repression of women, she told me, is not about Islam. It is about culture. Just look at how interpretations of Islam shift with geography. The closer countries are to other civilisations - the more progressive they are. Take Tunisia, in North Africa, where women have had full rights for 50 years. The tides of change have now reached the Gulf. I told her about my small ripple at the hotel. Her jaw dropped. "You asked to swim in Saudi Arabia? Young lady," she said, "that is more of a breakthrough than mine!" It wasn't of course. The right to swim comes a long way down the list of demands of the women in Saudi Arabia - well below the right to vote, or the right to drive a car. But the Saudi leaders are beginning to address that list. They have said that women will be allowed to vote in the local elections of 2009. If they keep their promise, that will be a revolution. The women voters might still be hidden beneath abayas, but they surely won't be expected to bring their male escorts into the voting booths. Will they?

Hundreds of troops, some loyal to rival factions Hamas and Fatah, fanned out on the streets of Gaza on Thursday. Up to 400 people have died in clashes between Palestinian factions since the Islamist Hamas won last year's parliamentary elections. But the rival parties agreed to form a coalition government earlier this year. On Friday, a number of Palestinians, including civilians and security officers from forces controlled by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, were wounded in shootouts in Gaza City. A further two civilians were hurt when militants from the armed wing of Hamas opened fire in the Jabaliya refugee camp north of Gaza City, the AFP news agency reported. The circumstances surrounding this incident are not clear. Since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, the strip has seen a wave of infighting, armed robberies, deadly family feuds and kidnappings. Several attempts to halt the violence have failed, and the interior minister in the new Palestinian coalition government, Hani Qawasmi, has threatened to resign because he says his plan for restoring security has not been carried out. As many as 3,000 police were reported to have taken part in the initial operations launched on Thursday, the Associated Press reported. One official told the AFP news agency that troops took up positions in the north of Gaza at entrances to towns and at major road junctions. Witnesses said that security personnel were inspecting vehicles on the approach to Gaza City and asking passengers to show their identity cards. Officials said that forces loyal to Fatah and Hamas would now wear the same police uniform and answer to the interior ministry, which has been placed under the control of Mr Qawasmi, a political independent in the coalition government. The full details of the security plan are not known. The first phase was set to last 100 days and to cover traffic and crime fighting, the Associated Press said.

The plan, which has yet to receive final approval, would involve building about 20,000 homes. The Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said the plan destroyed efforts to re-start the peace process. He said Israel had to choose between settlements or peace, but could not have both. Yehoshua Pollak, Jerusalem's deputy mayor, said the intention was to create a contiguous Jewish residential area linking East Jerusalem with major West Bank settlement blocs. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since 1967. It annexed the area in 1981 and sees it as its exclusive domain. This has not been recognised by the international community. Palestinians hope to establish the capital of their future state in the East Jerusalem.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6639233.stm	BBC NEWS | Programmes | From Our Own Correspondent | Blair passes on his African vision Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 11:07 GMT 12:07 UK E-mail this to a friend Blair passes on his African vision One of Tony Blair's biggest concerns has been the plight of Africa which he once famously described as a scar on the conscience of the world. The Africa Commission Report set out ideas for combating poverty There is a large yellow book on the top shelf of my bookcase. It is more than 450 pages in length, and I dip into it from time to time, whenever I need facts and information about Africa. It is the report that was drawn up by Tony Blair's Commission for Africa, two years ago. On the back cover, there is a photograph of the 17 commissioners - Tony Blair is in the middle of the front row. On his right-hand side, he is flanked by Gordon Brown and Bob Geldof. The Africa Commission was full of promise. The report starts with these words: "African poverty and stagnation is the greatest tragedy of our time. Poverty on such a scale demands a forceful response." Mr Blair, and those appointed to help him, wanted new ideas and action for a strong and prosperous Africa. And so, during the course of 2004 and 2005, the prime minister set about the task of trying to galvanise the rest of the world. Appropriately, the process began in Addis Ababa - the continent's diplomatic capital - where Emperor Haile Selassie and some of Africa's founding fathers created the Organisation of African Unity, back in 1963. Mr Blair spent time with villagers in Debre Zeit near Addis Ababa Mr Blair arrived there on a soaking wet October day, two and a half years ago, and was immediately taken by road to see a small project supporting orphaned children at Debre Zeit - an hour's drive from Addis. He was invited to sit on the grass in a field, encircled by the children who had come to entertain him with a traditional Ethiopian song. This was the prime minister rolling up his sleeves and getting a rare chance to find out what life is like in Africa's most deprived communities. He met an HIV-positive mother, who had been facing near-certain death. But the woman told Mr Blair how she had been given help, was now running a business and supporting her family. This, said Mr Blair, was what Africans needed - not just a hand-out of aid, but a helping hand to allow them to help themselves. The Blair visit to Ethiopia was all too brief. I wished he could have seen so much more - for this is a nation that epitomises so many of Africa's problems: extreme poverty, rapid population growth, abuses of human rights... And of course, Ethiopia - with its dramatic landscape - is a country that lies in a rough neighbourhood - the conflict-prone Horn of Africa. It was Bob Geldof who helped to put Ethiopia on the map two decades ago. In some Ethiopian villages time appears to have stood still So much has changed since the war-driven famine of 1984, but some things remain the same. And so, if he had stayed longer, I would have wanted Tony Blair to have taken the road that leads up the slopes of Entoto Mountain on the northern side of Addis Ababa. Here, the 4x4s and the battered old Addis taxis jostle for space with herds of goats and donkeys. But what you also see are women and young girls hunched over as they carry back-breaking loads of firewood from the eucalyptus trees on the mountainside. On foot, it is a long and arduous trek down into the city. And it is a medieval image - completely at odds with Tony Blair's vision of a modern, reformed Africa. It always serves as a reminder to me that it is going to take more than a few promises from the leaders of the Group of Eight industrialised nations to change the way of life here. I have never doubted Tony Blair's sincerity and commitment to Africa, but there is no question that he took on a gargantuan task when he sought to forge a new partnership between Africa and the developed world. Africa is full of surprises that can always throw a spanner or two in the works. The gap between Blair and Meles indicated a strained relationship The last time I saw the prime minister in this part of the world was at what was described as "a progressive governance summit", a small meeting of like-minded centre-left leaders who had gathered at an incongruous location - a small South African game park, north of Pretoria. At the news conference afterwards, Tony Blair was joined by - among others - the presidents of South Africa and Brazil. But Mr Blair had the misfortune - at the time - to find himself sitting next to Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, his erstwhile friend and member of the Commission for Africa. Only, Prime Minister Meles had - during 2005 - locked up members of the Ethiopian opposition after unrest following disputed elections. Another blow perhaps, to the "African Renaissance"? The body language between Blair and Meles, and the rather noticeable gap between their chairs at the news conference seemed to reveal a strained relationship. So now - in all likelihood - it is Gordon Brown who will take on some of the responsibility of keeping Africa on the world agenda. He has already done his fair share of cajoling at international finance ministers' meetings. And he has had some hands-on experience of the challenges in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. But he may want to consider the words of one activist I spoke to this week, who said: "The battle against poverty is a marathon, not a sprint."

Cricket Australia is facing a US $2m fine if it pulls out of a one-day series in Zimbabwe later this year. But Howard said: "Our over-riding objective is the tour not take place. "How long can the international cricket community go on doing things that give aid and comfort to someone who has been totally impervious to any entreaties?" The prime minister described Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe as a "grubby dictator" who had sanctioned violence to try and silence his political opponents. "I am jammed between my distaste for the government getting involved in something like this and my even greater distaste for giving a propaganda victory to Robert Mugabe," he added. The Australian team is due to play three one-day internationals in Zimbabwe in September and the only way their governing body could escape a financial penalty for cancelling the tour would be if the decision was taken because of security concerns. The government is, however, investigating whether there would be a legal basis for it to intervene and prohibit the tour. Foreign minister Alexander Downer met officials from Cricket Australia and the players' union, the ACA, in Melbourne on Thursday. Afterwards, Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland said they understood "very clearly" the government's preference for the team not to undertake the tour. But he added: "Cricket Australia is also conscious of world cricket's requirements that each country visit all other nations regularly as part of the ICC's Future Tours Program. Cricket Australia is strongly committed to the global development of cricket." Australia last played in Zimbabwe in 2004, a tour which was boycotted by spin bowler Stuart MacGill, and he has already spoken out about this year's proposed series. The ICC, meanwhile, issued a statement earlier this week in which it claimed it was "not a party" to the Future Tours Program Agreement between the 10 full member countries. "A member that does not comply with its obligation to tour another member is subject to a penalty of a minimum of US $2m or such greater amount that the host member can prove to have lost as a result of the failure to tour. "This is not an ICC fine. It is a contractual obligation between the respective members and if a member fails to fulfil that obligation, then it would have to pay the member against which it is defaulting," the statement continued.

On the back cover, there is a photograph of the 17 commissioners - Tony Blair is in the middle of the front row. On his right-hand side, he is flanked by Gordon Brown and Bob Geldof. The Africa Commission was full of promise. The report starts with these words: "African poverty and stagnation is the greatest tragedy of our time. Poverty on such a scale demands a forceful response." Mr Blair, and those appointed to help him, wanted new ideas and action for a strong and prosperous Africa. And so, during the course of 2004 and 2005, the prime minister set about the task of trying to galvanise the rest of the world. Appropriately, the process began in Addis Ababa - the continent's diplomatic capital - where Emperor Haile Selassie and some of Africa's founding fathers created the Organisation of African Unity, back in 1963. Mr Blair spent time with villagers in Debre Zeit near Addis Ababa Mr Blair arrived there on a soaking wet October day, two and a half years ago, and was immediately taken by road to see a small project supporting orphaned children at Debre Zeit - an hour's drive from Addis. He was invited to sit on the grass in a field, encircled by the children who had come to entertain him with a traditional Ethiopian song. This was the prime minister rolling up his sleeves and getting a rare chance to find out what life is like in Africa's most deprived communities. He met an HIV-positive mother, who had been facing near-certain death. But the woman told Mr Blair how she had been given help, was now running a business and supporting her family. This, said Mr Blair, was what Africans needed - not just a hand-out of aid, but a helping hand to allow them to help themselves. The Blair visit to Ethiopia was all too brief. I wished he could have seen so much more - for this is a nation that epitomises so many of Africa's problems: extreme poverty, rapid population growth, abuses of human rights... And of course, Ethiopia - with its dramatic landscape - is a country that lies in a rough neighbourhood - the conflict-prone Horn of Africa. It was Bob Geldof who helped to put Ethiopia on the map two decades ago. In some Ethiopian villages time appears to have stood still So much has changed since the war-driven famine of 1984, but some things remain the same. And so, if he had stayed longer, I would have wanted Tony Blair to have taken the road that leads up the slopes of Entoto Mountain on the northern side of Addis Ababa. Here, the 4x4s and the battered old Addis taxis jostle for space with herds of goats and donkeys. But what you also see are women and young girls hunched over as they carry back-breaking loads of firewood from the eucalyptus trees on the mountainside. On foot, it is a long and arduous trek down into the city. And it is a medieval image - completely at odds with Tony Blair's vision of a modern, reformed Africa. It always serves as a reminder to me that it is going to take more than a few promises from the leaders of the Group of Eight industrialised nations to change the way of life here. I have never doubted Tony Blair's sincerity and commitment to Africa, but there is no question that he took on a gargantuan task when he sought to forge a new partnership between Africa and the developed world. Africa is full of surprises that can always throw a spanner or two in the works. The gap between Blair and Meles indicated a strained relationship The last time I saw the prime minister in this part of the world was at what was described as "a progressive governance summit", a small meeting of like-minded centre-left leaders who had gathered at an incongruous location - a small South African game park, north of Pretoria. At the news conference afterwards, Tony Blair was joined by - among others - the presidents of South Africa and Brazil. But Mr Blair had the misfortune - at the time - to find himself sitting next to Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, his erstwhile friend and member of the Commission for Africa. Only, Prime Minister Meles had - during 2005 - locked up members of the Ethiopian opposition after unrest following disputed elections. Another blow perhaps, to the "African Renaissance"? The body language between Blair and Meles, and the rather noticeable gap between their chairs at the news conference seemed to reveal a strained relationship. So now - in all likelihood - it is Gordon Brown who will take on some of the responsibility of keeping Africa on the world agenda. He has already done his fair share of cajoling at international finance ministers' meetings. And he has had some hands-on experience of the challenges in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. But he may want to consider the words of one activist I spoke to this week, who said: "The battle against poverty is a marathon, not a sprint."

The US space agency Nasa has unveiled a model of a space telescope that scientists say will be able to see to the farthest reaches of the Universe. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is intended to replace the ageing Hubble telescope. It will be larger than its predecessor, sit farther from Earth and have a giant mirror to enable it to see more. Officials said the JWST - named after a former Nasa administrator - was on course for launch in June 2013. The full-scale model is being displayed outside the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in the US capital, Washington DC. It was recently shown off in Seattle at the American Astronomical Society meeting. The $4.5bn (2.3bn) telescope will take up a position some 1.5 million km (930,000 miles) from Earth. It will measure 24m (80ft) long by 12m (40ft) high and incorporate a hexagonal mirror 6.5m (21.3ft) in diameter, almost three times the size of Hubble's. Hubble, launched in 1990, has sent back pictures of our solar system, distant stars, and remote fledgling galaxies formed not long after the Big Bang. But scientists say the JWST will enable them to look deeper into space and even further back at the origins of the Universe. "Clearly we need a much bigger telescope to go back much further in time to see the very birth of the Universe," said Edward Weiler, director of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre. Martin Mohan of Northrop Grumman, the contractor building the telescope, said that the team was making excellent progress. "There's engineering to do, but invention is done, more than six years ahead of launch," he said. When ready, the JWST will be launched by a European Ariane 5 rocket. It is expected to have a 10-year lifespan. Until then, the 17-year-old Hubble telescope will continue to do its work. Nasa plans to send astronauts on the space shuttle to service it in 2008. THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE JWST is named after James E Webb, Nasa Administrator during the Apollo lunar exploration era; he served from 1961 to 1968 It will be placed 1.5m km from Earth, at Lagrange Point 2, an area of gravitational balance that keeps it in a Sun-Earth line The telescope will be shaded from sunlight by a shield, enabling it to stay cold, increasing its sensitivity to infrared radiation Three principal instruments will gather images of the Universe in the infrared region of the spectrum These will yield new information about how stars and galaxies first formed a few hundred million years after the Big Bang E-mail this to a friend Telescope mirror nears completion 08 Feb 07 | Science/Nature First stars in telescope's sights 12 Jan 07 | Science/Nature Large camera delights astronomers 10 Nov 03 | Science/Nature The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites Pope creates Brazil's first saint UK police face no action on shooting Nasa unveils Hubble's successor MOST POPULAR STORIES NOW Google searches web's dark side Confused penguin strays 5,000km Vultures pick off human body farm Nasa unveils Hubble's successor Floyd play at Barrett tribute gig Most popular now, in detail Confused penguin strays 5,000km Madeleine parents 'won't give up' Google searches web's dark side Two dead children were murdered Brown makes pitch to lead Britain Most popular now, in detail Locals believe police are doing all they can to find Madeleine Historic visit to the Boyne points way to the future How will history judge Tony Blair's war record?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/africa/6647195.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Africa | Guinea soldiers suspend protest Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 16:19 GMT 17:19 UK E-mail this to a friend Guinea soldiers suspend protest Soldiers say they were promised a pay rise after a 1996 army mutiny Soldiers in Guinea who marched on the capital have agreed to return to barracks after the president promised to meet them about their unpaid wages. The meeting is scheduled for Saturday and comes after a week of army unrest. A BBC correspondent in Conakry says there has been an air of panic in the city as soldiers took to the streets firing shots in the air. On Thursday, a civilian was shot dead and eight injured when soldiers opened fire in the southern town of Gueckedou. The protests began last week when the soldiers alleged President Lansana Conte had gone back on his pledge to increase their wages after an army mutiny in 1996. Guinea was the scene of violent protests earlier this year as people called for the ailing president to step down. A three-week general strike ended after a military crackdown and the appointment of a consensus prime minister. The BBC's Alhassan Sillah in Conakry says the situation remains very tense. [Prime Minister] Kouyate cannot solve the situation by asking the bank to print some money The soldiers marched into the city centre to the army headquarters. Shops and market stalls closed as people rushed to get home and pick their children up from school. At the height of the stand-off, two government radio stations went off air. There were also reports of disturbances in Kindia and Mamou in the east and Macenta in the south. Last week, a spokesman for the aggrieved soldiers told the BBC they wanted their promised 11-year salary arrears paid. He also said they wanted the resignation of senior military officials including the army chief, Gen Kelfala Camara, and the new Defence Minister, Arafan Camara. Guinea analyst Gilles Yabi, from the International Crisis Group, says these events do not come as a surprise. The deal emerged after days of intense negotiation "Even in the middle of demonstrations in January and February there were signs of discontent within the military... it was not connected to the political situation, it was really because of their conditions," he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. "The soldiers want to be rewarded for the loyalty they've maintained towards President Lansana Conte," he said. But Mr Yabi said it puts the new prime minister, Lansana Kouyate, in a very difficult position. He was appointed to curb inflation and bring in badly needed economic reforms. "That means that Kouyate cannot solve the situation by asking the bank to print some money," Mr Yabi said. Although Guinea's mineral wealth makes it potentially one of Africa's richest countries, its people are among the poorest in West Africa. Mr Conte seized power in a bloodless coup in 1984 and in 2003 won a third term in a poll boycotted by the opposition.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/uk_politics/6644717.stm	BBC NEWS | Politics | Brown makes pitch to lead Britain Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 15:45 GMT 16:45 UK E-mail this to a friend Brown makes pitch to lead Britain Gordon Brown said he had the "new ideas and vision" to govern Britain as he launched his long-awaited campaign to lead Labour and become prime minister. He praised Tony Blair and said he wanted to make the UK "one of the great success stories of the new century". But the launch suffered a hitch with Mr Brown's face obscured on TV coverage of his speech by glass autocues. Mr Blair earlier endorsed Mr Brown's bid to succeed him as prime minister, saying "he has what it takes". I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place - where I will always strive to be - and that is on people's side What will he do as PM? Launching his campaign at the Imagination Gallery in central London, Mr Brown said Mr Blair "has led our country for ten years with distinction - with courage, passion and insight". But he added: "In the weeks and months ahead, my task is to show I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people." Mr Brown said he welcomed challenges from other leadership contenders and pledged to lead a government "of all the talents," refusing to rule out employing ministers from other parties. Was that really him behind those plate glass windows? Standing in front of his campaign logo, "Gordon Brown for Britain", Mr Brown pledged to tour the country to "listen and learn" about people's concerns. "I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place - where I will always strive to be - and that is on people's side," he said. He rejected Conservative calls for a snap election, saying the Tories did not call for an election in 1990, when Margaret Thatcher stood down. He also denied he would move the government to the left, saying he would continue to "drive forward" New Labour reforms to the public services. But he said he wanted to strengthen Britain's constitution and give more power to MPs. "One of my first acts as prime minister would be to restore power to Parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy. "Government must be more open and more accountable to Parliament - for example in decisions about peace and war, in public appointments and in a new ministerial code of conduct." He can make a real difference to this country for the better and for the good In Full: Brown's speech Media: 'Iraq tarnished Blair' Mr Brown also suggested Britain could get its first written constitution, saying: "We need a constitution that is clear about the rights and responsibilities of being a citizen in Britain today." On Iraq, Mr Brown said: "I accept that mistakes have been made." He said he would be visiting Britain's troops and "listening to what the government of Iraq says". Later, in a speech in Knebworth, in Hertfordshire, Mr Brown promised to create a "new kind of politics" in which the government "gives power away so that people in the community can have more power". He said the challenge facing the government was to "create a strong society" to go with Britain's "strong economy". Mr Brown is the firm favourite to succeed Mr Blair when he quits on 27 June. He could still face a challenge from one of two left-wing backbenchers but there appears to be a coordinated effort among Labour MPs to unite behind him, with Blairite MPs Stephen Byers and Alan Milburn also expected to back him. I feel like Brown has been snuck in through the back door Send us your comments Mr Blair, who until now has held back from endorsing Mr Brown's bid to replace him, said: "I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labour Party and as prime minister and to endorse him fully." He added: "He has shown, as perhaps the most successful chancellor in our country's history, that he's got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great prime minister." But shadow chancellor George Osborne, for the Conservatives, said Mr Brown as chancellor had been "responsible for the failures of the past 10 years". "When you look at the things people are really fed up with, like the collapse of the pension system, like the failure to get money to the frontline of the health service, Gordon Brown is more responsible for that than any other politician including Tony Blair," Mr Osborne told BBC News 24. Q&A: What happens now? Analysis: Blair's exit message Referring to Labour's heavy election losses last week, he added: "I don't see how he could be the change that the country wants and the country voted for." Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vincent Cable said Mr Brown had focused too much on improving his image and criticised his "presidential" style. He added: "When he has tried to change his personality for PR purposes, it's been excruciatingly embarrassing... I think he's much better off being himself." Mr Brown is spending the day touring marginal Labour seats which the Tories are targeting. Commons leader Jack Straw, Mr Brown's campaign manager, said he wanted to "reach out" to the voters in the South-East of England that had brought Labour to power in 1997. Mr Straw also denied suggestions there would be a cooling in relations between Downing Street and Washington under a Brown premiership. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Gordon Brown and George Bush don't know each other anywhere nearly as well as Tony Blair and George Bush. That relationship will develop." Backbenchers Michael Meacher and John McDonnell are still trying to muster enough support between them to mount a leadership bid. They will meet on Monday - when nominations officially open - and the one with the fewest confirmed backers will stand aside.

Jalal Talabani was addressing students during a visit to Cambridge University. Asked when the UK and US should leave, he said: "I think in one or two years we will be able to recruit our own army forces and say goodbye to our friends." He added that he considered Prime Minister Tony Blair to be a "hero" and said he hoped Gordon Brown would continue his work. After a meeting with Mr Blair at 10 Downing Street, Mr Talabani said Mr Blair was a "dear friend" and a "great leader". I think it was a very noble job that your army and your people did in Iraq The Iraqi president expressed his sympathy towards the families of British forces killed in his country, who he said had died for a just cause. He said: "I am very, very sorry for the lives lost in Iraq." "I think it was a very noble job that your army and your people did in Iraq." Mr Talabani urged American politicians to reconsider plans to begin withdrawing their forces from his country. On Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed a draft bill that would provide funding for troops in Iraq only until July. Mr Talabani told reporters: "We are concerned.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/south_asia/6647799.stm	BBC NEWS | World | South Asia | Karachi braced for judge protests Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 16:27 GMT 17:27 UK E-mail this to a friend Karachi braced for judge protests Thousands of security personnel are deployed in the city At least one person has been killed and more than 100 arrested ahead of rallies over Pakistan's continuing judicial crisis in the southern city of Karachi. Demonstrations are planned for Saturday when Pakistan's ousted top judge is due to address his supporters in the city. Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry was suspended by President Musharraf in March. He denies abuse of power. The suspension triggered protests by lawyers and the opposition which have grown into an anti-government campaign. Observers say anger over the judge's suspension poses the biggest challenge to Gen Musharraf's rule since he seized power in 1999. The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Karachi, capital of Sindh province, says lawyers there plan a massive reception for the chief justice on Saturday. I assure you the MQM will follow the law to the letter Lawyer's house shot at Opposition political parties - including the six-party MMA Islamic alliance and the country's largest party, the Pakistan People's Party - are also expected to participate. The ruling party in Sindh, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), has said it will hold rival demonstrations in support of President Musharraf's government on the same day. More than 15,000 security personnel have been deployed in the city to prevent violence. Late on Friday morning, a security guard was shot dead by armed men forcibly closing down a shopping centre on Karachi's main thoroughfare, Shahrah-e-Faisal. Mr Chaudhry was suspended from his post in March Earlier, police arrested scores of political activists and raided homes across the city. "We have detained over 100 people who are a risk to security on 12 May," Azhar Farooqi, the city police chief, told the BBC. "We are monitoring the situation and there may be more arrests required." The city and provincial police are controlled by the home department which is headed by a minister from the MQM. But the party leadership denies that it has used the state machinery to help keep the opposition in line. "I assure you the MQM will follow the law to the letter and never indulge in such tactics," Dr Farooq Sattar, a senior MQM leader, told the BBC. He described such suggestions as "last resort propaganda". Both sides have refused to reschedule their rallies, and the lawyers have accused the provincial government of using intimidatory tactics. Ahead of the 12 May rallies, Munir Malik, a leader of the lawyers' campaign to have the chief justice reinstated, had his offices sealed by local building officials. The courts later suspended the move. Hours later, his home was attacked by unidentified gunmen. Since then there has been a visible increase in tensions in Karachi, which has a long history of political violence, our correspondent says.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6639385.stm	BBC NEWS | Programmes | From Our Own Correspondent | A letter from Iraq to Tony Blair Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 13:59 GMT 14:59 UK E-mail this to a friend A letter from Iraq to Tony Blair One issue threatens to overshadow Tony Blair's legacy, affecting his image and standing at home and abroad, the decision to go to war in Iraq. Even at the time of Saddam's fall, people were wary of the future I have never written to a politician in my life. But I very nearly made an exception for Tony Blair. It was towards the end of 2002, when it was already clear that the invasion of Iraq was only a matter of time. I found myself deeply torn. I had no illusions about the nature of Saddam Hussein. I had followed his brutal antics for years. I had been to his Iraq, and felt the all-pervasive fear instilled by his vigilant and ruthless police state. What a relief it was to get on the plane and feel that oppressive weight lifted off your shoulders, an experience that most Iraqis were denied. But when Saddam's excesses were at their worst, during the war with Iran in the 1980s, he was actually being discreetly supported by the Americans. Washington was turning a blind eye to human rights reports from its own State Department detailing how Iraqi children were being tortured in front of their parents to get them to confess or inform. In 1988, when the Iraqi air force dropped chemical bombs which killed thousands of Kurds at Halabja, I remember phoning the Pentagon, and being told: "We think it was the Iranians who did it." So on a personal level, I would be glad to see the end of Saddam Hussein and his harsh dictatorship. It was clear, long before it happened, that this was going to be a terrible mess. It had to be But the impending invasion was clearly not about to happen because he was a bad man. It might be the right thing, but it was being done for the wrong reasons - reasons that had more to do with the global ambitions of the ascendant neo-conservatives in Washington, and their desire to engineer a New Order in the Middle East. The chosen pretexts for the war - Saddam's alleged weapons of mass destruction and links with international terror - turned out to be simply invalid. I have often thought, over these past four years, of that regular cartoon slot in the satirical magazine Private Eye, entitled "Things We Seldom See". It features situations which would be blindingly logical, but just never happen. I wanted to propose one where President Bush addresses Saddam Hussein and says: "Mr Hussein, you were right. There were no weapons of mass destruction, and no links with terrorism. We'd like to apologise, and give you your country back." Apart from misgivings about Washington's real motives and objectives, it was clear, long before it happened, that this was going to be a terrible mess. It had to be. Iraq is a patchwork country, an ethnic and confessional cocktail, of Arabs and Kurds, Turkomans and Chaldaeans, Sunnis and Shiites. Iraq has been plagued with civil unrest and violence Such countries are usually held together by a strong centralised dictatorship, which could be benign or tyrannical. As soon as you admit the concept of democracy and take the lid off, it is bound to be difficult and chaotic in the best of conditions, in a place with no democratic traditions or culture. To blow the regime and all its control mechanisms away virtually overnight, through the massive use of force by people from halfway around the world, would inevitably plunge the country and the region into a long period of chaos, whatever exact form it would take. That is why I lay sleepless in my bed in Tehran, mentally composing that letter to Tony Blair that I never wrote. I was going to tell him, on the basis of three decades living and working in the region, that he was on the brink of a massive historical blunder. I never sent it, because I knew of course that it would not make a blind bit of difference, apart from perhaps salving my own conscience, and allowing me to say: "I told you so" - something that would bring no satisfaction at all. And so, four years on, look at what a terrible mess Mr Blair can now say goodbye to, and hand on to Gordon Brown. Where there used to be tight state control, there is massive terrorism on a daily basis. The Americans have been bombing Baghdad again, to quell Sunni militants and Shiite militias. At the end of the day, the British are minor players, politically important partners brought in on the coat-tails of the Americans They are building walls to separate districts, euphemistically calling them "gated communities". Millions of Iraqis have fled the country. In the south, British troops are trying to stifle Shiite militias which know they only have to wait, because the British will be gone before long. A transition of leadership in London is not going to make much difference on the ground in Iraq. Gordon Brown will be locked into a situation which he might or might not have chosen to get into in the first place, but will now be stuck with, and his options will be limited. At the end of the day, the British are minor players, politically important partners brought in on the coat-tails of the Americans. It is the outcome of their last-ditch struggle to control Baghdad and central Iraq that is crucial to the country's future.

Add time code information to 10/22/2005 - Minor improvements: [1.1.1] Added capability for elements to appear at the to allow explicit global relationships to be expressed. The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable).

This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared.

All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module.

The world champion bounced back after being beaten by team-mate Lewis Hamilton in Friday's first session to dominate practice in the afternoon. Alonso set a best lap of one minute 21.397 seconds to beat Hamilton, who was fifth, by 0.791secs. The Renaults of Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen were second and third, ahead of Ferrari's Felipe Massa. Hamilton improved by only 0.1secs over his morning time, while Alonso found nearly 0.9secs. Your views on the Spanish Grand Prix In the morning session, Alonso, who was outpaced by his rookie team-mate at the last race in Bahrain, set the early pace in 1:22.449, with Hamilton just behind. Both drivers improved their times on their second series of laps, but this time Hamilton was just over 0.1secs faster than the world champion. The 22-year-old improved his time again, by nearly 0.3secs on his third run, whereas Alonso did not go any faster, but the Spaniard was still clear of the Ferraris. Schumacher is attending his first GP since his retirement By the end of the afternoon Hamilton was sandwiched between the two Ferraris, with Kimi Raikkonen in sixth place, suggesting another close battle between F1's two dominant teams. The pace of the Renaults appears not to be indicative of a major step forward after their disappointing start to the season, according to Fisichella. "My feeling is that we are possibly a little bit closer to the cars in front of us," the Italian said, "even if we are clearly not fast enough to be second in the times on speed alone." Kovalainen added: "The target has to be to qualify in the top 10 but, just like at the last three races, it is going to be tough." Jenson Button continued to struggle in the Honda, managing only the 13th fastest time in the afternoon, just ahead of team-mate Rubens Barrichello. Button was 10th fastest in the morning, when he was nearly half a second down on Anthony Davidson's Super Aguri, which is effectively Honda's 2006 car. Button said: "We have made some small steps with the stability of the car since the last race but the outright pace has not yet improved a lot." Davidson dropped to 20th in the second session.

Hundreds of troops, some loyal to rival factions Hamas and Fatah, fanned out on the streets of Gaza on Thursday. Up to 400 people have died in clashes between Palestinian factions since the Islamist Hamas won last year's parliamentary elections. But the rival parties agreed to form a coalition government earlier this year. On Friday, a number of Palestinians, including civilians and security officers from forces controlled by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, were wounded in shootouts in Gaza City. A further two civilians were hurt when militants from the armed wing of Hamas opened fire in the Jabaliya refugee camp north of Gaza City, the AFP news agency reported. The circumstances surrounding this incident are not clear. Since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, the strip has seen a wave of infighting, armed robberies, deadly family feuds and kidnappings. Several attempts to halt the violence have failed, and the interior minister in the new Palestinian coalition government, Hani Qawasmi, has threatened to resign because he says his plan for restoring security has not been carried out. As many as 3,000 police were reported to have taken part in the initial operations launched on Thursday, the Associated Press reported. One official told the AFP news agency that troops took up positions in the north of Gaza at entrances to towns and at major road junctions. Witnesses said that security personnel were inspecting vehicles on the approach to Gaza City and asking passengers to show their identity cards. Officials said that forces loyal to Fatah and Hamas would now wear the same police uniform and answer to the interior ministry, which has been placed under the control of Mr Qawasmi, a political independent in the coalition government. The full details of the security plan are not known. The first phase was set to last 100 days and to cover traffic and crime fighting, the Associated Press said.

The Pope announced the sainthood from a throne flanked by bishops and choirs, and overlooked by a giant wooden cross. The Church has attributed two miracles to Friar Galvao, an 18th Century monk who is still seen as influential. The open-air Mass marks the highlight of the Pope's five-day visit to the world's most populous Catholic nation. Hundreds of thousands of believers from across Latin America cheered and waved flags at Sao Paulo's Campo de Marte airfield. Many had spent the night there. The BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo says the huge turn-out demonstrates that the Catholic Church remains a powerful force in Brazil. Brazil's first native-born saint Lived from 1739 to 1822 Credited by church with 5,000 miracle cures Founded monasteries and convents in Brazil Profile: Saint Antonio Galvao Pope visit: Reporter's diary In pictures: Pope in Brazil During the Mass, the 80-year-old pontiff encouraged his listeners to follow the example of the new saint by helping the needy "in an age so full of hedonism". He lauded Friar Galvao as a model of rectitude and humility, and went on to criticise the elements of the media that ridiculed the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage. After canonising Friar Galvao, the Pope also hugged Sandra Grossi de Almeida and her seven-year-old son, Enzo. She is one of two Brazilian females who the Church says are evidence of divinely inspired miracles that justify Friar Galvao's sainthood. Friar Galvao is remembered for producing Latin prayers written on tiny balls of paper that, when swallowed, had the apparent effect of curing a range of ailments. After taking one of these pills, Ms Almeida, who had a uterine malformation that should have made it impossible for her to carry a child for more than four months, gave birth to Enzo. Friar Galvao is also certified by the Church as healing a four-year-old girl said to have been considered incurable by doctors. I hope Pope Benedict XVI can help to resurrect our Brazilian Catholic identity Philippe Gebara, Rio de Janeiro Send us your comments Following the Mass, the Pope was due to meet some 430 Brazilian bishops at a Sao Paulo cathedral. Another highlight of the Pope's trip comes on Sunday, when a crowd of at least 350,000 people is expected to celebrate Mass in Aparecida, where the Pope will also take part in a conference of Latin American bishops. The forum, the first for 15 years, will bring together nearly 200 bishops and cardinals from Latin America and the Caribbean to set out the Church's agenda and future policies in the region. 'Sheep without a shepherd' On Thursday, the Pope received a rapturous reception from an audience of tens of thousands of young people gathered at a Sao Paulo stadium. Brazilians give their views on the Pope's stance on abortion and contraception His address focused on what he called the "snares of evil" - pre-marital sex, drug use, corruption, violence and the temptations of wealth and power. He urged the young to avoid these and asked them to "be promoters of life, from its beginning to its natural end". The Pope sparked controversy as soon as he arrived in Brazil on Wednesday by stressing his strong opposition to abortion, the subject of intense debate in the country, where some Brazilians are pushing for the legalisation of terminations. The World Health Organisation estimates that illegal abortions numbered more than a million in Brazil last year alone.

The US space agency Nasa has unveiled a model of a space telescope that scientists say will be able to see to the farthest reaches of the Universe. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is intended to replace the ageing Hubble telescope. It will be larger than its predecessor, sit farther from Earth and have a giant mirror to enable it to see more. Officials said the JWST - named after a former Nasa administrator - was on course for launch in June 2013. The full-scale model is being displayed outside the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in the US capital, Washington DC. It was recently shown off in Seattle at the American Astronomical Society meeting. The $4.5bn (2.3bn) telescope will take up a position some 1.5 million km (930,000 miles) from Earth. It will measure 24m (80ft) long by 12m (40ft) high and incorporate a hexagonal mirror 6.5m (21.3ft) in diameter, almost three times the size of Hubble's. Hubble, launched in 1990, has sent back pictures of our solar system, distant stars, and remote fledgling galaxies formed not long after the Big Bang. But scientists say the JWST will enable them to look deeper into space and even further back at the origins of the Universe. "Clearly we need a much bigger telescope to go back much further in time to see the very birth of the Universe," said Edward Weiler, director of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre. Martin Mohan of Northrop Grumman, the contractor building the telescope, said that the team was making excellent progress. "There's engineering to do, but invention is done, more than six years ahead of launch," he said. When ready, the JWST will be launched by a European Ariane 5 rocket. It is expected to have a 10-year lifespan. Until then, the 17-year-old Hubble telescope will continue to do its work. Nasa plans to send astronauts on the space shuttle to service it in 2008. THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE JWST is named after James E Webb, Nasa Administrator during the Apollo lunar exploration era; he served from 1961 to 1968 It will be placed 1.5m km from Earth, at Lagrange Point 2, an area of gravitational balance that keeps it in a Sun-Earth line The telescope will be shaded from sunlight by a shield, enabling it to stay cold, increasing its sensitivity to infrared radiation Three principal instruments will gather images of the Universe in the infrared region of the spectrum These will yield new information about how stars and galaxies first formed a few hundred million years after the Big Bang E-mail this to a friend Telescope mirror nears completion 08 Feb 07 | Science/Nature First stars in telescope's sights 12 Jan 07 | Science/Nature Large camera delights astronomers 10 Nov 03 | Science/Nature The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites Pope creates Brazil's first saint UK police face no action on shooting Nasa unveils Hubble's successor MOST POPULAR STORIES NOW Google searches web's dark side Confused penguin strays 5,000km Vultures pick off human body farm Guinea soldiers suspend protest Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing' Most popular now, in detail Confused penguin strays 5,000km Madeleine parents 'won't give up' Google searches web's dark side Two dead children were murdered Brown makes pitch to lead Britain Most popular now, in detail Locals believe police are doing all they can to find Madeleine Historic visit to the Boyne points way to the future How will history judge Tony Blair's war record?

They come from the Dutch government archives and include the testimony of a 27-year-old Dutch woman from May 1946. The Kyodo news agency says the documents show women were coerced into prostitution in occupied Indonesia. Japan's PM Shinzo Abe had claimed no evidence existed to prove that women had been forced to work as sex slaves. The documents are reported to have been found by a Japanese journalist investigating Japan's wartime crimes in Asia. The Dutch woman's testimony says she had her clothes ripped off her by Japanese military police. She says she was taken to a brothel and forced to work as a prostitute, despite her efforts to resist. That testimony, it is claimed, was submitted to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as evidence of forced mass prostitution in Magelang, in what is now Central Java, in 1944. Other documents are said to include further allegations that the Japanese forced women into prostitution. Earlier this year Prime Minister Abe said that investigations had failed to find any documentary evidence that the Japanese authorities in wartime had issued orders to soldiers to coerce women into sex slavery. He said though that he stood by a Japanese government apology to the women, known in Japan as "comfort women". The journalist who found these documents says they contradict the prime minister's denial that the authorities were directly involved in coercion. The Japanese Foreign Ministry says it is aware of his claims but has not seen the documents so cannot comment on what they might contain. It says the Japanese government has investigated its wartime activities in Indonesia thoroughly and acknowledges and apologises for the country's wartime use of sex slaves.

Official documents will list everybody who has owned any piece of land in the five years before its development. Senior local government officials will also have to declare their assets. A number of local officials have been arrested recently on allegations of fraud, money laundering and corruption linked to housing projects. In one of the biggest cases, nearly 60 people were arrested in the southern resort of Marbella, including a former mayor, several councillors, developers, art dealers and even a well-known singer. The government hopes that reducing the number of speculators and the degree of corruption will bring down prices. "With the instruments of this law we should put the brakes on exorbitant house prices," said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. The new law also reserves 30% of future property development for social housing and allows for planning decisions taken over the past two years to be reviewed under certain circumstances. It will come into force on 1 July, a few days after municipal and regional elections are held in Spain.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/europe/6646239.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Europe | Serbian parties in coalition deal Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 11:15 GMT 12:15 UK E-mail this to a friend Serbian parties in coalition deal Nationalist hardliner Tomislav Nikolic is now parliament speaker The main pro-reform parties in Serbia have agreed to form a government, more than three months after the general election, local media reports say. The deal was reached between the caretaker Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica, and President Boris Tadic, according to TV reports. Mr Tadic had set Friday as the deadline for a new prime minister to be named. If a government is not formed by 14 May, the president is obliged to call new elections. Earlier this week a hardline nationalist, Tomislav Nikolic, was elected parliamentary speaker, prompting fears that Serbia could abandon the road to reform. But he has now said he will resign because a new government is being formed. The parties have been wrangling over who will control the key ministries of defence and the interior, as well as the intelligence services. The nationalist Radicals became the largest party in parliament in the January election. But no party has enough seats to govern alone. Reports said President Tadic, whose Democratic Party is the most pro-Western, would take charge of the national security council, responsible for the hunt for the fugitive Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. The agreement involves the Democratic Party, Mr Kostunica's Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), G-17 and New Serbia. The BBC's Nick Hawton in Belgrade says the new government will have to tackle the difficult Kosovo issue. The UN Security Council is currently discussing a plan which would give the Serbian province a form of independence demanded by its majority Albanian population. Serbian leaders are opposed to the plan.
