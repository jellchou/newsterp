News First of 9 Kan. tornado victims buried By ROXANA HEGEMAN, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 3:42 AM ET GREENSBURG, Kan. - The cleanup and recovery stopped briefly Thursday as the first funeral procession for one of the nine residents killed during a massive tornado made its way to a cemetery. National Guard members took off their hard hats and waited until the procession, lead with a hearse carrying Beverly Lynn Volz, passed before they resumed work. Earlier, more than 100 people attended Volz' funeral at United Methodist Church in neighboring Mullinville. The funeral had to be held there because all the churches in Greensburg were destroyed. Volz, 52, was remembered as a "wonderful lady" known for her love of cats. "What a symbol of a person who cares and reaches out to the least of our creatures and provides a home," the Rev. Larry Bassett said during the service. Bassett told mourners that it is a time of stress for everyone. "I've seen friends and neighbors and people who didn't know each other wrap their arms around each other. Isn't that what a community is all about?" he said. "It is not about buildings." The tornado destroyed more than 90 percent of the tiny south-central Kansas city, and community leaders are trying to instill hope in a grieving population that is still sifting through the remnants of their homes. Across the city, the buzz of chain saws filled the air. A plume of black smoke from burning debris piles at a landfill drifted for miles. Homeowners loaded pickup trucks and vans with salvaged furniture and other remaining possessions. Frank Banta's home was spared, but several others he owned and his shop were demolished. He said he wasn't sure what would happen to the city. "A lot of them are leaving, going to take their money and go," he said. Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/marines_haditha	Haditha hearing to enter 4th day - Yahoo! News Haditha hearing to enter 4th day By THOMAS WATKINS, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 7:48 AM ET CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. - The biggest U.S. criminal case involving civilian deaths in the war begins its fourth day in court Friday with mounting testimony that Marines initially considered the killings of 24 Iraqis an unfortunate, but legitimate, consequence of urban combat. Witnesses have testified at a preliminary hearing for Capt. Randy W. Stone that the killings of 24 Iraqi civilians came on a brutal day of combat on Nov. 19, 2005 in Haditha. They said they did not see any need for an investigation at the time. Stone is one of four officers charged with dereliction of duty for failing to investigate the killings. Three enlisted Marines are charged with murder. An intelligence officer and an operations officer were among those expected to testify Friday. The attack occurred after a roadside bomb struck a Humvee convoy, killing one Marine and injuring two others. In the aftermath, Marines shot five Iraqis standing by a car and went house to house looking for insurgents, using grenades and machine guns to clear houses. Maj. Gen. Richard A. Huck, the top general in charge of Marines in Iraq's Al Anbar province when the killings occurred, testified Thursday that he knew about the deaths the day they took place, but considered them simply a "truly unfortunate" consequence of war at the time. "I had no information that a law of armed conflict violation had been committed," he said by video link from the Huck said he initially saw no reason to investigate the killing of women and children by troops, and said he didn't learn about allegations that civilians were intentionally targeted until three months later when a Time magazine reporter raised questions. Stone's attorney, Charles Gittins, called Huck to testify in an attempt to show Stone did nothing wrong because Marines throughout the command chain knew about the killings but agreed not to order an investigation because the deaths were deemed to have been lawful. On Wednesday, a Marine sergeant testified that his squad leader, Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, shot five Iraqi men as they stood with their hands in the air and then told comrades to lie about it. The hearing is part of an Article 32 investigation, the military's equivalent to a grand jury proceeding. Maj. Thomas McCann, the investigating officer, will hear evidence and recommend whether the charges should go to trial.

News 1 teen killed in Chicago bus shooting Fri May 11, 12:10 AM ET CHICAGO - A gunman boarded a Chicago Transit Authority bus on the city's South Side on Thursday afternoon and opened fire, killing one teenager and wounding four others, authorities said. The suspect fired multiple shots and then exited the bus and ran, said Assistant Deputy Superintendent Eugene Williams. He did not comment about a motive for the shooting and asked the public to call in with tips. The victims were all taken to area hospitals. Blair Holt, 16, died at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, said hospital spokeswoman Deb Song. Two teenage girls remained in fair condition at Advocate Christ, Song said. A 16-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy were in fair condition at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park, Mirabelli said. The shooting took place around 3:15 p.m., said CTA spokeswoman Wanda Taylor. The driver quickly pulled the bus over to a spot she believed was safe, said CTA spokeswoman Sheila Gregory.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/suspicious_devices	Men apologize for cartoon stunt - Yahoo! News Men apologize for cartoon stunt By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer BOSTON - Two men who planted electronic devices in a botched television promotion that prompted a bomb scare apologized Friday and performed community service to resolve the criminal charges against them. Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28, said they never expected the stunt to cause any turmoil. "I deeply regret that this incident caused such anguish and disruption to so many people," Berdovsky told the Charlestown District Court. Stevens said he saw the devices simply as "harmless entertainment." "I had no intention of upsetting or alarming anyone," he said. The two were accused of planting about three dozen battery-powered devices in Boston and Cambridge on Jan. 31. The devices, a promotion for Cartoon Network, had lights that created images of a cartoon character making an obscene gesture. Fears of terrorism arose when the devices were discovered in a subway station and on a bridge, among other locations. Bomb squads were deployed, and highways, bridges and some transit stations were temporarily closed. Similar signs were placed in nine other cities around the United States, but only in Boston did they elicit such a response. Berdovsky and Stevens were charged with placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct. In exchange for the community service and public apology, prosecutors agreed not to pursue the criminal case. Berdovsky performed 80 hours of service and Stevens completed 60 hours at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston. Attorney General Martha Coakley said it would have been difficult to prove to a jury that the men intended to create panic, and that she did not believe they realized the problems the ads would cause. "We believe this was an appropriate and fair resolution," Coakley said. Berdovsky said he was relieved the case was resolved without a trial. "I am looking forward to what the future has to bring. I'm just going to be working really hard and working on my art and working to build a really peaceful community for all of us to live in," Berdovsky told The Associated Press by telephone after the hearing. At Spaulding, the men designed a cartoon mural that will be painted in a waiting area for children undergoing physical therapy, said Oz Mondejar, Spaulding's vice president of human resources. They also helped patients use computers, cleaned the hospital's sailing docks and helped produce a DVD featuring patients talking about their rehabilitation successes. The contrite apologies offered in court Friday were in contrast to their behavior at their first court appearance in January, when they mugged for the camera and waved to friends in the courtroom.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/fort_dix_plot	Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail - Yahoo! News Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail By GEOFF MULVIHILL, Associated press Writer CAMDEN, N.J. - Six Muslim men suspected of plotting to massacre U.S. soldiers at Fort Dix were ordered held without bail Friday. Prosecutors argued that the men, all born outside the United States, pose a flight risk. They are being held at a federal detention center in Philadelphia. The men were arrested Monday night during what the said was an attempt to buy AK-47 machine guns, M-16s and other weapons. They targeted Fort Dix, a post 25 miles east of Philadelphia that is used primarily to train reservists, partly because one of them had delivered pizzas there and was familiar with the base, according to court filings. Their objective was to kill "as many American soldiers as possible," the documents said. The men have lived in and around Philadelphia for years, worshipped at moderate mosques and worked blue-collar jobs installing roofs, driving a cab, delivering pizzas and baking bread. Four are ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia, one is from Jordan and one is from Turkey. As they were led into the courtroom, each of the suspects smiled to relatives and friends, many of whom wept and blew kisses to them. Only one of the men, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, 22, asked to be released on bail, and friends and relatives offered to post properties they owned as collateral. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Stigall argued against letting Shnewer be released to the custody of his parents while awaiting trial. He said many of the illegal actions that the government alleges Shnewer committed happened or were planned at his parents' house. Defense lawyers for some of the men said they are considering attacking the prosecution's reliance on two paid informants who infiltrated the group more than a year ago and recorded conversations with the defendants. Authorities said they first learned about the men in January 2006 after a tip from a clerk at a Mount Laurel electronics store. The clerk called police because a home video the men wanted transferred to a DVD looked like it might have terrorist links, U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie said. Earlier this year, authorities said, the men took a training trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where they fired weapons and played paintball to prepare for an attack. Five of the men &#151; Shnewer; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan "Anthony" or "Tony" Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir "Elvis" Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. Abdullahu, who faces the least serious charges of the six, will have another bail hearing next Thursday.

News XM shock jocks apologize for sex comment 1 hour, 50 minutes ago WASHINGTON - XM Satellite Radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony apologized Friday for airing a homeless man's crude comments that he'd like to have sex with The remarks were made on their show Wednesday by a guest the duo call Homeless Charlie. As the name of each woman came up, the guest said he would like to have sex with her &#151; using language not fit for print. Opie and Anthony laughed as they imagined Rice's "horror" while describing a violent sexual encounter in which Rice is punched in the face. Washington-based XM condemned the remarks. "We deplore the comments made on Wednesday's 'Opie & Anthony Show,'" XM spokesman Nathaniel Brown told The Associated Press on Friday. He would not say whether XM planned to take disciplinary action. Opie and Anthony, whose full names are Anthony Cumia and Greg "Opie" Hughes, apologized to listeners on Friday's show. "We apologize to the public officials for comments that we made on our XM show on May 9th. We take very seriously the responsibility that comes with our creative freedom and regret any offense that this segment has caused," they said. Because the show airs on satellite radio, there are no federal restrictions on its content. According to XM's Web site, the radio service has parental controls that allow users to block access to channels that frequently contain explicit language. Those channels are designated with an "XL" notation. The same radio duo was dumped by CBS Radio in August 2002 for running a contest in which they said two listeners had sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. They were hired by XM in 2004. The remarks could become an issue as XM seeks approval from the to merge with New York-based Sirius Satellite Radio, said Tom Taylor, editor of the trade magazine Inside Radio. "XM and Sirius don't want any regulation," he said in Friday's New York Daily News. "But it's come up in four congressional hearings &#151; and at this point, the merger is such a close call, any issue could become important." Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire Va.

News 3 dead in crash on Chesapeake Bay bridge By BRIAN WITTE, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 9:44 AM ET ANNAPOLIS, Md. - A runaway trailer started a chain-reaction crash on the Chesapeake Bay bridge, killing three people and injuring five others as dozens of vehicles swerved to avoid it, authorities said. As crumpled trucks were hauled away Thursday evening, structural engineers examined the bridge by boat, air and foot and it was found to be structurally sound and safe, said Marcus Brown, chief of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police. Friday morning, all lanes were open again. The bridge, officially known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, is the main artery connecting Maryland's Eastern Shore with the rest of the state. With the westbound lanes closed all night, stores on the eastern side were busy. "They can't get across the bridge to go home so they're just hanging out until the bridge opens up. It's good for business, but it's not good for me here all alone," said Melodie Shreve, who was working by herself at the Shore Stop in Stevensville. The Best Western in Grasonville, a few miles from the bridge, sold out by 8 p.m. Melissa Hess, the front desk supervisor, said some guests who had suites even gave up their second room to help stranded motorists. The crash started when a small flatbed trailer being pulled by an SUV came unattached shortly after 4 p.m. at the start of the bridge's westbound span. In all, seven vehicles crashed, including a tanker hauling animal fat and a tow truck. "Other vehicles that were following swerved to avoid a trailer and that's what started this collision," said police Cpl. Jonathan Green. He described it as an "unbelievable crash scene" with vehicles pinned against each other and the railings, but said none went off the bridge. Brown said it was too early in the investigation to say whether charges would be filed. One person was flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center with life-threatening injuries; four others had less serious injuries, Brown said. Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire Va.

News 28 accused in marriage-citizenship scam By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 12:37 AM ET COLUMBIA, S.C. - More than two dozen men and women are accused of arranging or participating in marriages with Bulgarians to help the foreigners evade U.S. immigration laws, a federal prosecutor said Thursday. The scheme, which involved U.S. citizens being recruited and paid to marry Bulgarians, appears to have started in 1997, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin McDonald said. He would not comment on money amounts. "The allegations are that this was a ring, a conspiracy, to engage in fraudulent marriages," he said. A federal indictment charged 13 Bulgarians and 15 U.S. citizens with conspiring to arrange or participate in the marriages. Nine were still being sought. More than a dozen also faced an additional marriage fraud charge. "They did not reside together as husband and wife, and had no intention of residing together," the indictment states. The marriages occurred in South Carolina, where the U.S. citizens were recruited, and Georgia, the indictment stated. Some of the Bulgarians were arrested in Boston, Chicago, Stamford, Conn., and Portland, Maine, McDonald said. If convicted of the conspiracy charge, each person would face up to five years in prison. Many suspects appeared in court Wednesday and were released on bail, McDonald said. Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/socal_fire	Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire - Yahoo! News Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire By ANDREW GLAZER, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 1 minute ago AVALON, Calif. - Firefighters working through the night turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and forced hundreds of people to evacuate amid falling ashes. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of a massive force of fire trucks and water-dropping aircraft on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. Flames that had menaced the city the night before were no longer visible from Avalon on Friday. A puff of smoke rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor and a layer of ash were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon, feeding on dry brush and being fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small businesses in the canyons outside the city burned. About 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders, and hundreds of residents and tourists lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. Friday's forecast promised better firefighting conditions. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday were expected to calm to 10 mph and were blowing the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of that fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 &#151; the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. In Minnesota, a wildfire that has already destroyed 45 structures threatened about 200 more structures and closed half of the 57-mile Gunflint Trail. The fire has burned about 45 square miles since it started Saturday at a campsite on remote Ham Lake. No injuries have been reported. In Maryland, a fast-moving fire, whipped by high winds, consumed a large warehouse on the Eastern Shore that served as a food processing plant during both world wars. Associated Press writers Daisy Nguyen and Christina Almeida in Los Angeles, and Gillian Flaccus in Long Beach contributed to this report.

Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of samples per second taken to create the media object. It is expressed in thousands of samples per second (kHz). It is an optional attribute. is number of audio channels in the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of seconds the media object plays. It is an optional attribute. is the height of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared. If this element is not included, it assumes that no restrictions are necessary. It has one optional attribute. r (cz 1 lz 1 nz 1 oz 1 vz 1) is the URI that identifies the rating scheme.

It has 1 required attribute and 3 optional attributes. specifies the url of the thumbnail. It is a required attribute. specifies the height of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the width of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the time offset in relation to the media object. Typically this is used when creating multiple keyframes within a single video. The format for this attribute should be in the DSM-CC's Normal Play Time (NTP) as used in RTSP [ RFC 2326 3.6 Normal Play Time ]. It is an optional attribute. NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use. Allows a taxonomy to be set that gives an indication of the type of media content, and its particular contents. It has 2 optional attributes. is the URI that identifies the categorization scheme.

It has 4 optional attributes. Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module. A movie review with a trailer, using a Creative Commons license. My Movie Review Site Movie Title: Is this a good movie? A music video with a link to a player window, and additional metadata about the video, including expiration date. Discussions of great videos The latest video from an artist Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light Several different songs that relate to the same topic. Discussion on different songs These songs make me think about blah Same song with multiple files at different bitrates and encodings. (Bittorrent example as well) Songs galore at different bitrates Cool song by an artist Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this specification, and to all those that sent suggestions and corrections.

News Md. school evacuated over odd bottle 2 hours, 39 minutes ago TIMONIUM, Md. - A high school was evacuated Friday after firefighters found a bottle containing a suspicious liquid in a classroom, and a teacher was taken to a hospital for dizziness. Firefighters could not immediately identify the odor coming from the bottle, which was in a trash can at Dulaney High School in a suburb of Baltimore, said Pierce Jones, a spokesman for the Baltimore County Fire Department. Police said a chemistry lab, a bathroom and a hallway were affected. The ill teacher was taken to a local hospital, Jones said. No other injuries were reported. The fire department's hazardous materials team and members of the county police bomb squad were on the scene as a precaution, Jones said. The incident was reported just before 8 a.m., said Sgt. John Young of the Baltimore County Police Department. Principal Lyle Patzkowsky said he expected the school's 1,850 students to return to the building before noon.

News 2 detained in Las Vegas bombing By KEN RITTER, Associated Press Writer LAS VEGAS - Two people were being held in connection with a deadly bombing at a Los Vegas Strip parking lot, police said Friday. One man was questioned as a "person of interest" after being detained on false identification charges, and his home was searched for clues in the bombing that killed an immigrant worker at a hot dog stand on Monday, police said. The homemade bomb had been left on the victim's car at Luxor hotel-casino's parking garage and went off after he picked it up. Police said a second person also was taken into custody but released no further information. The identity of the man who was detained was not made public after he was taken into custody Thursday evening. Police searched the man's home late Thursday "looking for anything tied to the case, including components that could be used to make an explosive device or any items that could tie him or others to the Luxor homicide," Cassell said. Police would not say what led them to the man. "He was detained for questioning," Cassell said. "He will be arrested on the warrants." The development came hours after police released blurry freeze-frame images of a car and appealed for public help to find it and the person who placed the deadly bomb. Police Lt. Lewis Roberts said Thursday that police were still trying to determine a motive for the explosion that mortally wounded 24-year-old Willebaldo Dorantes Antonio. Dorantes Antonio died at a hospital about two hours later of a head injury. A woman who was with Dorantes Antonio escaped injury. Police have said Dorantes Antonio was the intended target and the bombing was not a terrorist act or a mob hit. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the motion-activated bomb blew up with the force of a stick of dynamite. Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/wildfires	Second Ga. wildfire threatens tiny city - Yahoo! News Second Ga. wildfire threatens tiny city By RUSS BYNUM, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 12:17 AM ET FOLKSTON, Ga. - A second wildfire in the Okefenokee Swamp has burned more than 100,000 acres, rivaling in just five days the vast record-setting fire that has scorched southeast Georgia for more than three weeks, firefighters said Thursday. The rapidly growing fire, fed by fast-burning swamp grasses, had been reported at just 68,650 acres Thursday morning. Though mostly well within the swamp, it was spreading mostly to the west toward the town of Fargo, a tiny city of 380 about eight miles west of the swamp. Firefighters didn't know the exact acreage of the blaze, ignited Saturday by a lightning strike in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. But Mark Ruggiero, commander of the joint team battling the swamp blazes, said the fire had grown larger that the 116,480-acre fire burning since April 16 that was the largest wildfire on record in Georgia. "It's still in the refuge, but getting real close to breaking the perimeter," he said. Bobby Kitchens, a firefighting operations chief, said the younger fire likely grew so quickly because it's burning in the southern part of the swamp where a 2002 wildfire consumed much of the brush, leaving mostly grasses that burn more rapidly. The older fire, burning about two miles north of the refuge headquarters, has slowed somewhat as it has entered an area of wetter swamp prairies. Georgia and Florida have been battling wildfires for weeks, with nearly 300 square miles charred as a drought has left the land tinder-dry. Smoke-filled air created a burning smell and a dusting of ashes that coated cars and buildings through much of Florida and southeastern Georgia. The haze over Florida forced the closure of several highways. Health officials warned the elderly, small children and people with breathing problems to stay indoors, although some areas were not as smoky Thursday. No one has died in the fires and just one firefighter had minor injuries. Authorities has been hoping the year's first named storm would bring rain. But the remnants of Subtropical Storm Andrea were not promising much rainfall relief &#151; only up to an inch was expected. A wildfire in Baker County, which started when one of the Georgia fires jumped the St. Mary's River, kept residents of the tiny community of Taylor away from their homes for a third day. Georgia officials issued a mandatory evacuation in southern Charlton County, saying about 300 homes may be in the path of the state's largest wildfire since 1957, when record-keeping began. It started April 16 when a tree fell on a power line near Waycross, Ga., and has burned 116,480 acres &#151; or 182 square miles &#151; of forest and swampland. Most of Florida's wildfires have been started by lightning, although the Division of Forestry was investigating nine suspected cases of arson. In northern Minnesota, high wind fanned a fire around the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. A mandatory evacuation order around the area of the landmark Gunflint Lodge, just east of the scenic Gunflint Trail that leads from Grand Marais into the wilderness, was extended Thursday evening another 9 miles east to the area around the Poplar Lake Fire Hall, according to the Minnesota Interagency Fire Center Bill Paxton, a spokesman for the firefighting effort, said the fire was "challenging" the containment lines. "They're holding right now," he said. "We're having some difficulty holding them, but they're holding now." The fire had burned more than 45 square miles and destroyed about 45 structures since it started Saturday. The shifting winds Thursday put another 100 buildings at risk, fire officials said. At the Trail Center Lodge, it was a chaotic scene after the owners were they had to leave, even though they'd had a sprinkler running to help protect the property. They rushed to pull down items from the walls, densely packed with everything from trophy fish to zany bumper stickers to a moosehead. Kary Graham, a niece of the owners, pulled an armadillo off a shelf and joked, "Hey, I saved the armadillo!" Moments later, she began tearing up over a wall plastered with snapshots. She was told not to save the pictures. "This is the hardest part," Graham said as she looked at the wall of photos. A squad of elite firefighters was taking command of the blaze, which had burned its way into Canada. Nearly 450 firefighters were on the scene Thursday. Associated Press writers Brian Skoloff in West Palm Beach, Fla., Ron Word in Jacksonville, Fla., and Amy Forliti in northern Minnesota contributed to this report.

News Katrina dips in popularity as baby name By BEN EVANS, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 22 minutes ago WASHINGTON - As baby names go, Katrina isn't in vogue these days. But she isn't persona non grata, either. From its peak in the 1980s &#151; when it regularly ranked among the 100 most popular names that parents chose for their daughters &#151; it had gradually slumped to 247th by 2005, even before Hurricane Katrina smashed the Gulf Coast in late summer of that year. The name's association with the catastrophe has now knocked it out of consideration for most parents, sinking its popularity to the lowest ebb since the 1950s. Only about 850 baby girls in the United States were named Katrina last year, according to new data released Friday by the , dropping it more than 100 slots on the popularity list. At a rank of 382nd, it now sits just below Brenna. Ironically, the two states that suffered most of Katrina's wrath bucked the trend, if only in small numbers. In Louisiana, the number of babies named Katrina jumped from eight in the 12 months before the storm to 15 in the 12 months after, according to state health officials. In Mississippi, seven babies were given the name from 2004 until the storm hit in August 2005, according to state data. The number climbed to 24 from September 2005 through the end of 2006. Overall, the country's most popular names list hasn't changed much since 2005. Emily and Jacob remain atop the list. Emily has been the top girls' name since 1996; Jacob for boys since 1999. The national trend surprised Cleveland Evans, a psychology professor and names expert at Bellevue University in Nebraska. But he said Katrina isn't likely to go extinct. "This is not going to be a name like Adolf that's going to disappear and be unusable ever again," he said, referring to that name's association with Adolf Hitler. Scarlett and Stephen Billis, a Los Angeles-area couple who named their daughter Katrina last May. Scarlett said the couple was reluctant to use the name less than a year after the hurricane, but her husband had always liked it as a variation of Katherine, a family name. Also, their family is Greek and the name is close to the popular Greek name Katerina. "People ask if we named her after the hurricane," Billis said. "We didn't pick it because of that and we were actually hesitant ... but we do joke that our house looks like a hurricane hit." The Social Security Administration's rankings, released each year just before Mother's Day, are based on some 4.2 million card applications from 2006. Social Security began compiling the name lists in 1997.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/school_lockdown	Police, bomb dog search Colo. school - Yahoo! News Police, bomb dog search Colo. school By COLLEEN SLEVIN, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 3:39 AM ET BOULDER, Colo. - Police searched a high school room by room Thursday after a cook reported seeing two suspicious men in the building around dawn, both wearing camouflage and one in a ski mask. Authorities said no classes or groups were meeting in Boulder High School at the time. Police sealed off the building, and school officials canceled classes for the day. A four-hour search by 23 officers in three SWAT teams found no signs of a break-in, Police Chief Mark Beckner said. The search included utility-access tunnels under the building and at one point two officers could be seen on the roof, their rifles drawn. Beckner said there was no indication the intruders were armed. "This could be a spring, end-of-school-year prank. It could be a burglary. It could be kids goofing around, or it could be more serious," Beckner said. "Given the times that we live in and recent events, we have to take all precautions." Beckner said the cook spotted the men around 6 a.m. in the first floor cafeteria of the three-story building, and that they ran when she yelled at them. She described them as young but was unable to describe their faces, Beckner said. Beckner said a witness reported seeing three or four people dressed in black on a bike path near the school at 4:30 a.m., one of them wearing a ski mask. The witness described having a casual conversation with them, Beckner said. Video from one of 15 surveillance cameras outside the school showed two people running away from the school at 5 a.m., Beckner said. The school has no interior surveillance cameras, officials said. Chris King, deputy superintendent of the Boulder Valley School District, said all the doors should have been locked at 6 a.m., but school officials had not been able to verify that they were. The only employees known to have been inside were the cook and two custodians, who customarily disarm the school's alarm system when they arrive. At a nearby snowboard shop, Boulder High freshman Jake Hanifin, 15, and his friends said the incident didn't sound like a prank. "I think it's hard to believe it's a joke if a kid comes in with a ski mask," he said. "To push a joke to that limit would be pretty intense." No threats had been made against the 1,900-student school in recent days, the police chief said. Earlier this spring, graffiti had been found inside the building saying people would die on April 19, the day before the anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings near Denver. Classes were held that day with extra security, he said. The University of Colorado alerted students, faculty and staff on parts of the campus near the high school, but no classes or other activities were interrupted, the university said. Hundreds flee S.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/jamestown_anniversary	Va. commemorates Jamestown settlement - Yahoo! News Va. commemorates Jamestown settlement By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 8:00 AM ET JAMESTOWN, Va. - Virginia this weekend will commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of America's first permanent English settlement, Jamestown, with fireworks, concerts and an appearance by The party, which begins Friday and lasts through Sunday, has been held every 50 years, but organizers have been careful to dub this year's a "commemoration" rather than a "celebration." With the arrival of the English in May 1607, native Indian tribes eventually were pushed off their lands, and slavery in America is traced to Jamestown, where the first Africans in the country arrived in 1619. This year's anniversary of the colony, which was founded as a business venture, is the first to focus on all three of those cultures. The 1957 anniversary was a largely white affair. Blacks were involved in the 1907 anniversary exposition, held an hour away in Norfolk, which included a visit by black educator and leader Booker T. Washington on "Negro Day." "In 2007, it's our year to get it right, to make sure everyone is at the table," Gov. Timothy M. Kaine said. More than half of the tickets for this weekend's events remained unsold as of last week, according to the most recent tally available. Organizers had planned to limit tickets to 90,000 &#151; 30,000 for each day &#151; to limit crowding. Single-day tickets cost $30. Activities were planned at Historic Jamestowne, where archaeologists in the mid-1990s found the remains of the settlers' fort, which had long been thought to have been washed away in the James River; the Jamestown Settlement museum, which has replicas of the fort, the settlers' three ships and an Indian village; and at the new Anniversary Park, across from Jamestown Settlement. On Friday, Kaine was expected to join former , honorary chair of Jamestown 2007, and other dignitaries at the rededication of Historic Jamestowne. He was expected to help officially ring in the weekend with a ceremony at Anniversary Park later Friday. The United States Postal Service planned a ceremony Friday to mark the sale of a new 41-cent Jamestown postage stamp. The stamp's triangular shape represents the settlers' original three-sided fort and their three ships. On Saturday, a replica of the small work boat that colonist John Smith used to explore the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in the early 17th century will set sail to retrace Smith's voyage. Other highlights include a joint performance by the Virginia Symphony and Richmond Symphony orchestras to premiere works written for the commemoration and a concert headlined by Bruce Hornsby, the Williamsburg-based pianist and songwriter. President Bush will participate in ceremonies on Sunday, and the weekend will conclude with the performance of a 400-piece orchestra and a 1,607-voice choir. Hundreds flee S.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/virginia_tech_graduation	Va. Tech dad: Graduation 'right for us' - Yahoo! News Va. Tech dad: Graduation 'right for us' By KRISTEN GELINEAU, Associated Press Writer BLACKSBURG, Va. - Some families of the 32 shooting victims couldn't bear to attend Virginia Tech's graduation Friday. Others said they had no choice but to come. "We have to. This is right for us," said Peter Read, whose freshman daughter Mary Karen Read was among those killed in the April 16 attack. The school issued diplomas and class rings to him and relatives of the other 26 student victims. Five faculty members were also slain before the gunman killed himself. Read had traveled from Annandale with 15 family members for the ceremony, which he said "recognizes what all of the students were here to do. It validates their choices, and it validates what they were doing." School spokesman Mark Owczarski said security remains high because some families may feel unsettled returning to the campus. Typical to measures for a home football game, bags will be checked before the ceremony, but guests will not pass through metal detectors or undergo more intrusive security measures. Gen. John Abizaid, who oversaw Operation Iraqi Freedom, is the keynote speaker. issued a statement praising "the compassion and resilient spirit" of the Virginia Tech community and the 3,600 graduating seniors and others earning advanced or associate degrees. "Laura and I salute the Virginia Tech Class of 2007. We also remember the students and teachers whose lives were taken last month," he said. "They will always hold a special place in the hearts of this graduating class and an entire nation." Twins Andrea and Michelle Falletti of Chantilly, Va., said they will not let the shootings overshadow their college memories of , spring breaks, camping trips and partying with friends. Their parents and grandparents will be in the audience, and it will, in many ways, still be the graduation they've long envisioned. "Obviously, what has happened has affected everything in our lives, and it will affect graduation," said Andrea Falletti, 21. "In a way, it's not going to be celebrating us as much; it's more about what we've done as a community. But that's OK. I'm proud of what we've done here." Richard Roopan, a business information technology major who posed for photos Thursday in his cap and gown outside Torgersen Hall, said the atmosphere on campus was "a little bit more somber than celebratory." After nearly four weeks of mourning, Roopan said he hopes there will be some joy. "But you have to remember them, also, and what they could have done and their achievements and how, you know, this moment that we have right now has been taken away from them," he said. Leaving Blacksburg won't be easy, Andrea Falletti said. "It's brought us closer, but in a different way," she said. "We're all kind of having these same feelings now. It's kind of a special thing." Associated Press writers Vicki Smith, Mark Carlson and Sagar Meghani contributed to this report. Hundreds flee S.

News Murder verdict upheld despite DNA trick Thu May 10, 11:51 PM ET OLYMPIA, Wash. - Police didn't violate any privacy laws when they posed as lawyers to get a man's DNA sample from an envelope he licked, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday, upholding the man's murder conviction. John Athan was sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for the 2004 Seattle killing of a 13-year-old girl in 1982, when Athan was 14. Police suspected him at the time but lacked the evidence to arrest him, and the case went unsolved for two decades. In 2003, police sent Athan a letter on the stationery of a fictitious law firm, asking if they could represent him in a class-action lawsuit. Athan, of Palisades Park, N.J., licked the envelope and returned it, providing the DNA sample investigators needed to link him to semen found on the girl's body. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the ruse violated his privacy rights. The court's 6-3 ruling found no privacy interest in the saliva used to seal a person's mail. But even though posing as a lawyer is a misdemeanor under state law, the trick "was not so outrageous or shocking as to warrant dismissing the case," Justice Charles Johnson wrote for the majority. The Washington State Bar Association had argued that letting police pose as lawyers was unnecessary and could chill relationships between attorneys and clients, and dissenting justices agreed. Dissenters and one member of the majority also worried that the ruling did not give strong enough privacy protections to a person's DNA. Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire Va.

News Man guilty in Chicago restaurant murders By KAREN HAWKINS, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 11:26 PM ET CHICAGO - A man was found guilty Thursday in the execution-style murders of seven people at a Chicago restaurant 14 years ago in what authorities say was a robbery that netted less than $2,000. Jurors deliberated for about eight hours before delivering the verdict against Juan Luna on all seven counts of first-degree murder. The same jurors will reconvene on Monday for the death penalty phase of case. "Today the agonizing wait is over," said Wisconsin state Rep. Jennifer Shilling, whose parents owned the Brown's Chicken and Pasta in Palatine and were among those killed. "We as family can finally exhale from this long and emotional nightmare." Victims' families began sobbing in the minutes before the verdict was read and their crying intensified when it was finally announced in court. Another man, Luna's high school friend James Degorski, has pleaded not guilty to the murders and will be tried separately. The evidence against Luna included DNA recovered from a chicken dinner the night of the slayings and a videotaped confession from the 33-year-old appliance installer. Defense attorneys attacked the reliability of that evidence during the trial and again at closing arguments, saying the DNA might not be Luna's and that, even if it was, it doesn't prove he committed the crime. Luna was 18 when prosecutors said he and Degorski walked into the restaurant on Jan. 8, 1993, at closing time and carried out the killings. The bodies of the restaurant owners Richard and Lynn Ehlenfeldt and five employees were found in a walk-in cooler and freezer. Luna was arrested nearly five years ago and is now a married father of a young son. Jurors had grisly evidence to review, including horrific crime scene photos and chilling descriptions of how the victims were systematically executed. Hundreds flee S. Calif. island wildfire Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/military_secrets_china	Engineer guilty in military secrets case - Yahoo! News Engineer guilty in military secrets case By GILLIAN FLACCUS, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 7:24 AM ET SANTA ANA, Calif. - After a six-week trial, a federal jury convicted a Chinese-born engineer of conspiring to export U.S. defense technology to China, including data on an electronic propulsion system that could make submarines virtually undetectable. Friends and colleagues knew Chi Mak as an unassuming, brilliant man who worked 12-hour days as an engineer for a defense contractor, rarely went out and scrimped to pay off his 700-square-foot suburban home. Federal prosecutors portrayed Mak as a polished agent for the Chinese who used his low-key lifestyle and good reputation as a cover for his real work &#151; conspiring to pass U.S. secrets for more than two decades. The jury sided with the government, also finding Mak guilty of acting as an unregistered foreign agent, attempting to violate export control laws and making false statements to the Prosecutors had dropped a charge of the actual export of defense articles. Mak stared straight ahead and seemed to hold back tears as the verdict was read. One of his attorneys gently rubbed his back. Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Staples said Mak faces up to 45 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 10. "We were confident from the start and we're very happy with the verdict," Staples said. The government accused Mak, a naturalized U.S. citizen, of taking thousands of pages of documents from his defense contractor employer, Power Paragon of Anaheim, and giving them to his brother, who passed them along to Chinese authorities over a number of years. Mak was arrested in 2005 in Los Angeles after FBI agents stopped his brother and sister-in-law as they boarded a flight to Hong Kong. Investigators said they found three encrypted CDs in their luggage that contained documents on a submarine propulsion system, a solid-state power switch for ships and a Power Point presentation on the future of power electronics. Mak acknowledged during the trial that he copied classified documents from his employer and kept copies in his office. He maintained he didn't realize that making the copies was illegal. Chi Mak's wife, brother and other relatives also have been indicted and go on trial together on June 5. Staples said the government may use the verdict to try to negotiate plea bargains with Mak's indicted family members, who pleaded not guilty. Defense attorneys Marilyn Bednarski and Ronald Kaye said they would appeal the verdict, insisting the government had manipulated the facts. In many instances, the government was allowed to present classified information to U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney in his chambers, and the defense team was not allowed to view the government's application for a warrant to bug Mak's house and car, Kaye said. "It is so absurd to believe that he has been passing technology for 20 years when they had not one witness and not one piece of paper to corroborate this," Kaye said. The trial featured testimony from FBI agents, officials, encryption and espionage experts and the engineer himself. Key to the trial was the government's allegation that Mak confessed to the conspiracy &#151; and even named his so-called "handler" and specific restricted documents &#151; during an untaped jailhouse interview two days after his arrest. Mak testified he never confessed during that interview, but admitted on cross-examination that he lied repeatedly in an earlier taped interview about the number of times he had visited China and when he told authorities he didn't have friends or relatives there. He said he felt intimidated during the interrogation. "This is why I lied," he said. "They were pushing me that night." Mak's attorneys focused on a paper he had written on the propulsion system that was found in his brother's luggage at Los Angeles International Airport. Mak said he believed he was doing nothing wrong by giving the paper to his brother to take out of the country because he had written it for Power Paragon and had presented it at an engineering conference in 2004. The government, however, alleged the documents were export-controlled and couldn't fall into foreigners' hands.
