News First of 9 Kan. tornado victims buried By ROXANA HEGEMAN, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 3:42 AM ET GREENSBURG, Kan. - The cleanup and recovery stopped briefly Thursday as the first funeral procession for one of the nine residents killed during a massive tornado made its way to a cemetery. National Guard members took off their hard hats and waited until the procession, lead with a hearse carrying Beverly Lynn Volz, passed before they resumed work. Earlier, more than 100 people attended Volz' funeral at United Methodist Church in neighboring Mullinville. The funeral had to be held there because all the churches in Greensburg were destroyed. Volz, 52, was remembered as a "wonderful lady" known for her love of cats. "What a symbol of a person who cares and reaches out to the least of our creatures and provides a home," the Rev. Larry Bassett said during the service. Bassett told mourners that it is a time of stress for everyone. "I've seen friends and neighbors and people who didn't know each other wrap their arms around each other. Isn't that what a community is all about?" he said. "It is not about buildings." The tornado destroyed more than 90 percent of the tiny south-central Kansas city, and community leaders are trying to instill hope in a grieving population that is still sifting through the remnants of their homes. Across the city, the buzz of chain saws filled the air. A plume of black smoke from burning debris piles at a landfill drifted for miles. Homeowners loaded pickup trucks and vans with salvaged furniture and other remaining possessions. Frank Banta's home was spared, but several others he owned and his shop were demolished. He said he wasn't sure what would happen to the city. "A lot of them are leaving, going to take their money and go," he said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/marines_haditha	Marine: Haditha officials wanted probe - Yahoo! News Marine: Haditha officials wanted probe By THOMAS WATKINS, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 40 minutes ago CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. - The town council in Haditha, , complained to Marine officers about the killings of 24 civilians, but U.S. military officials rejected a call to investigate, a Marine intelligence captain testified Friday. Capt. Jeffrey Dinsmore testified that council members met with battalion commander Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani and company commander Capt. Lucas McConnell from the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines on Nov. 27, 2005, eight days after a Marine squad killed 24 Iraqis including women and children in their homes. Dinsmore said the council had circulated a flier demanding an investigation into the deaths and outlining allegations that Marines deliberately targeted civilians after a deadly roadside bombing, but he dismissed the flier as propaganda. "My assessment was the city council was being used as a tool of insurgent propaganda," Dinsmore said. "We would see allegations like that a couple of times a week." Dinsmore, who has not been charged, spoke on the fourth day of a preliminary hearing for Capt. Randy W. Stone, one of four officers, including McConnell and Chessani, charged with dereliction of duty for failing to investigate the killings. Three enlisted Marines are charged with unpremeditated murder in the biggest U.S. criminal case involving civilian deaths in the Iraq war. The attack occurred Nov. 19, 2005 after a roadside bomb struck a Humvee convoy, killing one Marine and injuring two others. In the aftermath, Marines shot five Iraqis by a car and went house to house looking for insurgents, using grenades and machine guns to clear houses. Maj. Gen. Richard A. Huck, the top general in charge of Marines in Iraq's Al Anbar province when the killings occurred, testified Thursday that he knew about the deaths the day they occurred, but considered them simply a "truly unfortunate" consequence of war at the time. "I had no information that a law of armed conflict violation had been committed," he said by video link from the Stone's attorney, Charles Gittins, called Huck to testify in an attempt to show Stone did nothing wrong because Marines throughout the command chain knew about the killings but agreed not to order an investigation because the deaths were deemed to have been lawful. Several other military officials have testified that the killings were considered an unfortunate consequence of war, and they saw no need to investigate. On Wednesday, a Marine sergeant testified that his squad leader, Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, shot five Iraqi men as they stood with their hands in the air and then told comrades to lie about it. The hearing is part of an Article 32 investigation, the military's equivalent to a grand jury proceeding. Maj. Thomas McCann, the investigating officer, will hear evidence and recommend whether the charges should go to trial.

News 1 teen killed in Chicago bus shooting Fri May 11, 12:10 AM ET CHICAGO - A gunman boarded a Chicago Transit Authority bus on the city's South Side on Thursday afternoon and opened fire, killing one teenager and wounding four others, authorities said. The suspect fired multiple shots and then exited the bus and ran, said Assistant Deputy Superintendent Eugene Williams. He did not comment about a motive for the shooting and asked the public to call in with tips. The victims were all taken to area hospitals. Blair Holt, 16, died at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, said hospital spokeswoman Deb Song. Two teenage girls remained in fair condition at Advocate Christ, Song said. A 16-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy were in fair condition at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park, Mirabelli said. The shooting took place around 3:15 p.m., said CTA spokeswoman Wanda Taylor. The driver quickly pulled the bus over to a spot she believed was safe, said CTA spokeswoman Sheila Gregory.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/suspicious_devices	Men apologize for Boston cartoon stunt - Yahoo! News Men apologize for Boston cartoon stunt By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 57 minutes ago BOSTON - Prosecutors said they would not pursue charges against two men who planted electronic devices around the city as part of a botched advertising campaign after the pair apologized Friday for causing a bomb scare. Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28, also performed community service at a rehabilitation center in a deal with prosecutors. In contrast to their first court appearance in January, when they mugged for the camera and waved to friends in the courtroom, the men offered contrite apologies and said they never expected the stunt to cause any turmoil. "I deeply regret that this incident caused such anguish and disruption to so many people," Berdovsky told the Charlestown District Court. Stevens said he saw the devices simply as "harmless entertainment." "I had no intention of upsetting or alarming anyone," he said. The two were accused of planting about three dozen battery-powered devices in Boston and Cambridge on Jan. 31. The devices, a promotion for Cartoon Network, had lights that created images of a cartoon character making an obscene gesture. Fears of terrorism arose when the devices were discovered in a subway station and on a bridge, among other locations. Bomb squads were deployed, and highways, bridges and some transit stations were temporarily closed. Similar signs were placed in nine other cities around the United States, but only in Boston did they elicit such a response. Berdovsky and Stevens were charged with placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct. Attorney General Martha Coakley said it would have been difficult to prove to a jury that the men intended to create panic, and that she did not believe they realized the problems the ads would cause. "We believe this was an appropriate and fair resolution," Coakley said. Berdovsky said he was relieved the case was resolved without a trial. "I am looking forward to what the future has to bring. I'm just going to be working really hard and working on my art and working to build a really peaceful community for all of us to live in," Berdovsky told The Associated Press by telephone after the hearing. Berdovsky performed 80 hours of service and Stevens completed 60 hours at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston. The men designed a cartoon mural that will be painted in a waiting area for children undergoing physical therapy, said Oz Mondejar, Spaulding's vice president of human resources.

News Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail By GEOFF MULVIHILL, Associated press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET CAMDEN, N.J. - Six Muslim men suspected of plotting to massacre U.S. soldiers at Fort Dix were ordered held without bail Friday. Prosecutors argued that the men, all born outside the United States, pose a flight risk. They are being held at a federal detention center in Philadelphia. The men were arrested Monday during what the said was an attempt to buy AK-47 machine guns, M-16s and other weapons. They targeted Fort Dix, a post 25 miles east of Philadelphia that is used primarily to train reservists, partly because one of them had delivered pizzas there and was familiar with the base, according to court filings. Their objective was to kill "as many American soldiers as possible," the documents said. The men have lived in and around Philadelphia for years, worshipped at moderate mosques and worked blue-collar jobs installing roofs, driving a cab, delivering pizzas and baking bread. Four are ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia, one is from Jordan and one is from Turkey. As they were led into the courtroom, each of the suspects smiled to relatives and friends, many of whom wept and blew kisses to them. Only one of the men, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, 22, asked to be released on bail, and friends and relatives offered to post properties they owned as collateral. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Stigall argued against letting Shnewer be released to the custody of his parents while awaiting trial. He said many of the illegal actions that the government alleges Shnewer committed happened or were planned at his parents' house. Defense lawyers for some of the men said they are considering attacking the prosecution's reliance on two paid informants who infiltrated the group more than a year ago and recorded conversations with the defendants. Authorities said they first learned about the men in January 2006 after a tip from a clerk at a Mount Laurel electronics store. Circuit City spokeswoman Jackie Foreman said Friday that credit for the tip is shared by two employees. She declined to name them but said the company has "communicated its appreciation." She declined to give details. The pair called police because a home video the men wanted transferred to a DVD looked like it might have terrorist links, U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie said. Earlier this year, authorities said, the men took a training trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where they fired weapons and played paintball to prepare for an attack. Five of the men &#151; Shnewer; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan "Anthony" or "Tony" Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir "Elvis" Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. Abdullahu, who faces the least serious charges of the six, will have another bail hearing next Thursday.

News XM shock jocks apologize for sex comment 2 hours, 23 minutes ago WASHINGTON - XM Satellite Radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony apologized Friday for airing a homeless man's crude comments that he'd like to have sex with The remarks were made on their show Wednesday by a guest the duo call Homeless Charlie. As the name of each woman came up, the guest said he would like to have sex with her &#151; using language not fit for print. Opie and Anthony laughed as they imagined Rice's "horror" while describing a violent sexual encounter in which Rice is punched in the face. Washington-based XM condemned the remarks. "We deplore the comments made on Wednesday's 'Opie & Anthony Show,'" XM spokesman Nathaniel Brown told The Associated Press on Friday. He would not say whether XM planned to take disciplinary action. Opie and Anthony, whose full names are Anthony Cumia and Greg "Opie" Hughes, apologized to listeners on Friday's show. "We apologize to the public officials for comments that we made on our XM show on May 9th. We take very seriously the responsibility that comes with our creative freedom and regret any offense that this segment has caused," they said. Because the show airs on satellite radio, there are no federal restrictions on its content. According to XM's Web site, the radio service has parental controls that allow users to block access to channels that frequently contain explicit language. Those channels are designated with an "XL" notation. The same radio duo was dumped by CBS Radio in August 2002 for running a contest in which they said two listeners had sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. They were hired by XM in 2004. The remarks could become an issue as XM seeks approval from the to merge with New York-based Sirius Satellite Radio, said Tom Taylor, editor of the trade magazine Inside Radio. "XM and Sirius don't want any regulation," he said in Friday's New York Daily News. "But it's come up in four congressional hearings &#151; and at this point, the merger is such a close call, any issue could become important." The FCC did not return phone calls Friday seeking comment. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News 3 dead in crash on Chesapeake Bay bridge By BRIAN WITTE, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 9:44 AM ET ANNAPOLIS, Md. - A runaway trailer started a chain-reaction crash on the Chesapeake Bay bridge, killing three people and injuring five others as dozens of vehicles swerved to avoid it, authorities said. As crumpled trucks were hauled away Thursday evening, structural engineers examined the bridge by boat, air and foot and it was found to be structurally sound and safe, said Marcus Brown, chief of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police. Friday morning, all lanes were open again. The bridge, officially known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, is the main artery connecting Maryland's Eastern Shore with the rest of the state. With the westbound lanes closed all night, stores on the eastern side were busy. "They can't get across the bridge to go home so they're just hanging out until the bridge opens up. It's good for business, but it's not good for me here all alone," said Melodie Shreve, who was working by herself at the Shore Stop in Stevensville. The Best Western in Grasonville, a few miles from the bridge, sold out by 8 p.m. Melissa Hess, the front desk supervisor, said some guests who had suites even gave up their second room to help stranded motorists. The crash started when a small flatbed trailer being pulled by an SUV came unattached shortly after 4 p.m. at the start of the bridge's westbound span. In all, seven vehicles crashed, including a tanker hauling animal fat and a tow truck. "Other vehicles that were following swerved to avoid a trailer and that's what started this collision," said police Cpl. Jonathan Green. He described it as an "unbelievable crash scene" with vehicles pinned against each other and the railings, but said none went off the bridge. Brown said it was too early in the investigation to say whether charges would be filed. One person was flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center with life-threatening injuries; four others had less serious injuries, Brown said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/missouri_flooding	More Mo. flooding; parts of river crest - Yahoo! News More Mo. flooding; parts of river crest By CHRIS BLANK, Associated Press Writer WOOLDRIDGE, Mo. - Levee breaks along the Missouri River flooded homes, farms, highways and railroad tracks as floodwaters that have inundated the region were expected to peak in some spots this weekend. Near-record flood levels dropped in some places but rose in northwest and central Missouri, as worried residents removed valuables from their homes and filled sandbags to protect river communities. A barge that floated loose in Glasgow was captured by the state water patrol about 60 road miles downstream near Hartsburg, officials said. The water patrol planned to tie it up until the waters recede, Highway Patrol Capt. Tim Hull said. Along the Mississippi River, surging water and debris threatened to knock loose a docked, four-story pleasure barge and slam it into a bridge. Three of the four chains holding it in place broke, but crews and a private tug boat company were able to secure it. Inmates from St. Joseph prison and National Guard members filled sandbags to try to protect a water treatment plant, schools and an ethanol plant near Craig, where the Missouri River dropped a few inches Thursday. The water got within "a hillbilly's whisker from going over in several places," Holt County Sheriff Kirby Felumb said. Rivers breached or topped dozens of levees across the state, officials said. No serious injuries or deaths had been reported in the flooding, said Brian Hauswirth, a spokesman for the State Emergency Management Agency. The storms that raised river levels also generated the tornadoes that killed 12 people in Kansas last weekend. Although the river crests were lower than forecast in many areas, residents remained anxious. Many were here for the 1993 floods, among the most costly in U.S. history. At the State Emergency Operations Center, Gov. Matt Blunt said damage assessment teams were being dispatched to 17 counties, and about 100 Missouri National Guard members had been deployed. He said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has prepared about 1.2 million sandbags. "We were fortunate that a majority of counties made a lot of improvements since '93," National Guard Col. Glenn Hagler said. The rain-swollen rivers and streams that make up the Missouri River system are causing damage as the water flows east toward St. Louis, where the Missouri River meets the Mississippi, said Suzanne Fortin, a meteorologist with the In Jefferson City, the Missouri River was expected to crest Sunday at 8.7 feet above flood stage, which could cause flooding at the airport and other low-lying areas below the bluff where the state Capitol sits. Officials in Chariton County, which includes Brunswick, said the Grand River was expected to crest Friday afternoon and the levees should hold. People were sandbagging some low-lying spots. Some basements had water in them, but no serious damage or injuries were reported. Also Friday, farmers in Wooldridge, a tiny town about 15 miles west of Columbia, contested plans by the Department of Conversation to let a small amount of water into a wetland habitat. Levees had cut the area off from the Missouri River, said wildlife regional supervisor Mike Schroer. But town residents objected and stopped water from entering the pipe about 15 minutes after it was opened, and the agency said it had no plans to try again. John Clay, whose farm is protected by the levee, said two area residents were standing guard to prevent state officials from reopening it. "This could not be acceptable, and there can be no good reason to do this at this point in time with the river flooding," he said. Associated Press writer Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City and Jim Salter in St. Louis, Mo., contributed to this report. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News 28 accused in marriage-citizenship scam By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 12:37 AM ET COLUMBIA, S.C. - More than two dozen men and women are accused of arranging or participating in marriages with Bulgarians to help the foreigners evade U.S. immigration laws, a federal prosecutor said Thursday. The scheme, which involved U.S. citizens being recruited and paid to marry Bulgarians, appears to have started in 1997, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin McDonald said. He would not comment on money amounts. "The allegations are that this was a ring, a conspiracy, to engage in fraudulent marriages," he said. A federal indictment charged 13 Bulgarians and 15 U.S. citizens with conspiring to arrange or participate in the marriages. Nine were still being sought. More than a dozen also faced an additional marriage fraud charge. "They did not reside together as husband and wife, and had no intention of residing together," the indictment states. The marriages occurred in South Carolina, where the U.S. citizens were recruited, and Georgia, the indictment stated. Some of the Bulgarians were arrested in Boston, Chicago, Stamford, Conn., and Portland, Maine, McDonald said. If convicted of the conspiracy charge, each person would face up to five years in prison. Many suspects appeared in court Wednesday and were released on bail, McDonald said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

Calif. island fire turned from town By ANDREW GLAZER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET AVALON, Calif. - Firefighters turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and some residents planned to return to their homes Friday after thousands were forced to evacuate a day earlier. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of dozens of fire trucks and air tankers on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. "Everyone is working very hard to make sure that the people are safe and the animals are safe," Gov. Most of the 76-square-mile island is owned by a land conservancy, home to wildlife including the Catalina Island fox, North American bison and bald eagle. Flames that had menaced the main city of Avalon the night before were no longer visible from there on Friday. But a layer of ash and a puff of smoke that rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon in the island's rugged interior, feeding on dry brush and fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small structures in the canyons outside the city burned. About 3,800 residents and tourists fled, Schwarzenegger said. As people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland, many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Anita Bussing, a therapist who has a second home on the island, described a sky "completely gray with orange streaks." The helicopters were flying all over the place," she said. "People were freaking out, children were crying." Island hotel worker Susana Garcia, 22, waited long into the night at the dock looking for her father. She had gone to the mainland to do errands before the fire started and was unable to reach her father, who had stayed behind. "I've been asking everybody if they've seen him, but I haven't found him yet," Garcia said. Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. One firefighter was overcome by inhalation and was in stable condition. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday calmed and were expected to blow the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Television actor Steven W. Bailey, who lives near the park, had gone to Catalina with his wife to escape the smoke and heat on Thursday. As they approached the island, he spotted the smoke of the island blaze, and when they arrived, they weren't allowed to check into their hotel. "It just descended into more and more fire, more and more smoke, more and more ash," Bailey told KABC-TV. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of the Griffith Park fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 &#151; the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away. Associated Press writers Daisy Nguyen and Christina Almeida in Los Angeles, and Gillian Flaccus in Long Beach contributed to this report.

Add time code information to 10/22/2005 - Minor improvements: [1.1.1] Added capability for elements to appear at the to allow explicit global relationships to be expressed. The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object.

This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared.

This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module. A movie review with a trailer, using a Creative Commons license. My Movie Review Site Movie Title: Is this a good movie? A music video with a link to a player window, and additional metadata about the video, including expiration date. Discussions of great videos The latest video from an artist Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light Several different songs that relate to the same topic. Discussion on different songs These songs make me think about blah Same song with multiple files at different bitrates and encodings. (Bittorrent example as well) Songs galore at different bitrates Cool song by an artist Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this specification, and to all those that sent suggestions and corrections.

News Md. school evacuated over odd bottle By BEN GREENE, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 12 minutes ago TIMONIUM, Md. - A high school was evacuated Friday after firefighters found a bottle containing a suspicious liquid in a classroom, and a teacher was taken to a hospital for dizziness. A student was arrested hours later. Police aren't releasing the 18-year-old man's name until formal charges are drawn up, Baltimore County police spokesman Bill Toohey said. The bottle found in a trash can smelled like chlorine but the investigation was still continuing into whether it was intended to be an incendiary device, Toohey said. "It was a bottle that contained a toxic substance," Toohey said. Police said the affected area involved a chemistry lab, a bathroom and a hallway at Dulaney High School in a suburb of Baltimore. The ill teacher was taken to a local hospital, Sgt. John Young of the Baltimore County Police Department said. No other injuries were reported. The fire department's hazardous materials team and members of the county police bomb squad were on the scene as a precaution, Jones said. The incident was reported just before 8 a.m., Young said. The school's 1,850 students were allowed to return to the building around 11 a.m. Full Coverage: School Violence Va.

News 2 detained in Las Vegas bombing By KEN RITTER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 2:31 PM ET LAS VEGAS - Two people were being held in connection with a deadly bombing at a Las Vegas Strip parking lot, police said Friday. One man was questioned as a "person of interest" after being detained on false identification charges, and his home was searched for clues in the bombing that killed an immigrant worker at a hot dog stand on Monday, police said. The homemade bomb had been left on the victim's car at Luxor hotel-casino's parking garage and went off after he picked it up. Police said a second person also was taken into custody but released no further information. The identity of the man who was detained was not made public after he was taken into custody Thursday evening. Police searched the man's home late Thursday "looking for anything tied to the case, including components that could be used to make an explosive device or any items that could tie him or others to the Luxor homicide," Cassell said. Police would not say what led them to the man. "He was detained for questioning," Cassell said. "He will be arrested on the warrants." The development came hours after police released blurry freeze-frame images of a car and appealed for public help to find it and the person who placed the deadly bomb. Police Lt. Lewis Roberts said Thursday that police were still trying to determine a motive for the explosion that mortally wounded 24-year-old Willebaldo Dorantes Antonio. Dorantes Antonio died at a hospital about two hours later of a head injury. A woman who was with Dorantes Antonio escaped injury. Police have said Dorantes Antonio was the intended target and the bombing was not a terrorist act or a mob hit. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the motion-activated bomb blew up with the force of a stick of dynamite. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Calif. island survives wildfire scare By GILLIAN FLACCUS, Associated Press Writer AVALON, Calif. - Water-dumping planes and helicopters helped beat back soaring flames that threatened this quaint Catalina Island town Friday, giving firefighters a victory that allowed nearly 4,000 evacuated residents to start coming home. Even though the six-square-mile blaze was only 10 percent contained, the wildfire and thick smoke was confined to the tinder-dry brush in the mountains of this narrow island 30 miles off Los Angeles. Avalon's cobblestone streets, brightly painted bungalows, landmark casino and tourist hotels were mostly spared, with only one home and several outbuildings burned. No one was seriously injured. "Thank goodness the firefighters did get here because that made the difference," said Martha Ashleigh, 61, who has lived on Catalina on and off for years. "We were watching from our balcony and we could just see truck after truck go up there. They were just fabulous." A day earlier, flames bore down from the mountains, raining ash and chaos on the crescent harbor. Evacuated residents clambered onto ferries that passed hovercrafts packed with fire trucks from the mainland. Many were workers who cook and clean for vacationers. Others were at vacation homes as the summer tourist season geared up. "It's like a war zone. The skies turned completely gray with orange streaks. The helicopters were flying all over the place," said Anita Bussing, a therapist whose other home is in Long Beach. "People were freaking out, children were crying." By Friday afternoon, one ferry full of residents was headed back to the island on from Long Beach, and a relay of water-carrying helicopters saturated a hillside at the edge of town where smoke curled into the blue sky. The step appeared intended to extinguish any lingering hot spots. The cause of the fire, which erupted Thursday afternoon in the 76-square-mile island's rugged interior, had not yet been determined. The island's relative isolation has proven a liability before. A 1915 fire that started in a hotel burned half the town's buildings. The island's romantic vibe was memorialized in the 1958 hit "26 Miles (Santa Catalina)." Before private jets and third homes became standard fare for the rich and really famous, Santa Catalina was a celebrity haunt for the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Cecil B. DeMille. About 300 movies have been shot on the island or in nearby waters, including "Mutiny on the Bounty," "Chinatown," "Jaws" and "Apollo 13." One relic of that era are the herds of bison that were brought over for filming and later released. Environmentalists said it was too early to tell how the blaze affected the island's overall ecosystem, home to rare animal and plant life, including the Catalina Island fox. But four bald eaglets that hatched earlier this year without human help were unharmed, according to Bob Rhein, a spokesman for the Catalina Island Conservancy which owns most of the island. The eagles were wiped out decades ago by chemical contamination. Just days before and about 50 miles away on the mainland, crews beat back flames in Los Angeles' major park that singed a neighborhood of multimillion-dollar homes. That was the third menacing fire in the Hollywood Hills this spring &#151; and wildfire season here isn't supposed to heat up until the fall. Around the country, firefighters battled a wildfire in Georgia and northern Florida that burned 179,940 acres &#151; or 281 square miles &#151; since a lightning strike ignited it a week ago. The fire, which started last Saturday in the middle of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, took just six days to grow larger than a wildfire that has burned 116,480 acres of Georgia forest and swampland over more than three weeks. In Georgia, the fire posed a potential threat to the tiny city of Fargo, where 380 people live about eight miles west of the Okefenokee Swamp. No evacuations had been ordered Friday. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away. Associated Press writers Jeff Wilson and Robert Jablon in Los Angeles, Peter Prengaman in Long Beach and Andrew Glazer in Avalon contributed to this report.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_go_ot/baby_names_katrina	Fewer new 'Katrinas' after hurricane - Yahoo! News Fewer new 'Katrinas' after hurricane By BEN EVANS, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 33 minutes ago WASHINGTON - As baby names go, Katrina isn't in vogue these days. But she hasn't disappeared either. From its peak in the 1980s &#151; when it regularly ranked among the 100 most popular names that parents chose for their daughters &#151; it had gradually slumped to 247th by 2005, even before Hurricane Katrina smashed the Gulf Coast in late summer of that year. The name's association with the catastrophe has now knocked it out of consideration for most parents, sinking its popularity to the lowest ebb since the 1950s. Only about 850 baby girls in the United States were named Katrina last year, according to new data released Friday by the , dropping it more than 100 slots on the popularity list. At a rank of 382nd, it now sits just below Brenna. Ironically, the two states that suffered most of Katrina's wrath bucked the trend, if only in small numbers. In Louisiana, the number of babies named Katrina jumped from eight in the 12 months before the storm to 15 in the 12 months after, according to state health officials. In Mississippi, seven babies were given the name from 2004 until the storm hit in August 2005, according to state data. The number climbed to 24 from September 2005 through the end of 2006. Overall, the country's most popular names list hasn't changed much since 2005. Emily and Jacob remain atop the list. Emily has been the top girls' name since 1996; Jacob for boys since 1999. The national trend surprised Cleveland Evans, a psychology professor and names expert at Bellevue University in Nebraska. But he said Katrina isn't likely to go extinct. "This is not going to be a name like Adolf that's going to disappear and be unusable ever again," he said, referring to that name's association with Adolf Hitler. Scarlett and Stephen Billis, a Los Angeles-area couple, named their daughter Katrina last May. Scarlett said the couple was reluctant to use the name less than a year after the hurricane, but her husband had always liked it as a variation of Katherine, a family name. Also, their family is Greek and the name is close to the popular Greek name Katerina. "People ask if we named her after the hurricane," Billis said. "We didn't pick it because of that and we were actually hesitant ... but we do joke that our house looks like a hurricane hit." The Social Security Administration's rankings, released each year just before Mother's Day, are based on some 4.2 million card applications from 2006.

News Security tighter for Colo. graduation Fri May 11, 1:47 PM ET BOULDER, Colo. - University of Colorado commencement ceremonies were held under increased security Friday, a day after a scare at nearby Boulder High School. About 18,000 people attended the ceremonies, in addition to about 5,000 graduates, at a stadium on the university campus, which borders the high school grounds. SWAT officers searched the high school for four hours Thursday after a cook discovered two young males dressed in camouflage before students arrived. They ran off when she yelled at them, police said. Classes resumed at the high school Friday morning, with additional police officers and the number of student entranceways cut from 10 to just two. The district said attendance was normal. Police chief Mark Beckner said authorities don't have much information to help identify the two people, but word would likely spread at the school if they were students.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/jamestown_anniversary	Va. marks Jamestown settlement - Yahoo! News Va. marks Jamestown settlement By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 26 minutes ago JAMESTOWN, Va. - History lovers lined up Friday to buy a postage stamp recognizing Jamestown as America's first permanent English settlement, one of several weekend events marking the site's 400th anniversary. The commemoration will also include concerts, fireworks and a Sunday appearance by More than 100 white tents and several stages were set up around the Jamestown venues, giving them the feel of a county fair. Cultural anthropologist Judith Scott, who's been collecting stamps since was 8, waited more than an hour to buy the new Jamestown issue. The 41-cent stamp's triangular shape represents the settlers' original three-sided fort and their three ships. With her purchases tucked inside a commemorative tote bag, she and her husband, Carl, were ready to start hitting the concert stages and exhibition tents. "We don't to miss a thing," said Scott, a Venezuela native who lives in Oakton. Activities were taking place at Historic Jamestowne, where archaeologists in the mid-1990s found the remains of the settlers' fort, which had long been thought to have been washed away in the James River; the Jamestown Settlement museum, which has replicas of the fort, the settlers' three ships and an Indian village; and at the new Anniversary Park, across from Jamestown Settlement. Virginia has been throwing major Jamestown bashes every 50 years, but they have been careful to call this year's event a "commemoration," rather than a celebration. With the arrival of the English in May 1607, native Indian tribes eventually were pushed off their lands, and slavery in America is traced to Jamestown, where the first Africans in the country arrived in 1619. This year's anniversary of the colony, which was founded as a business venture, is the first to focus on all three of those cultures. The 1957 anniversary was a largely white affair. Blacks were involved in the 1907 anniversary exposition, held an hour away in Norfolk, which included a visit by black educator and leader Booker T. Washington on "Negro Day." "In 2007, it's our year to get it right, to make sure everyone is at the table," Gov. Timothy M. Kaine said. More than half of the weekend's 90,000 tickets remained unsold as of last week. Amateur historian James Pegram of Hernando, Fla., said he planned to attend all three days. "I love this place and I think everyone in America should be here at least once," Pegram said. On Friday, Kaine was expected to join former Supreme Court Justice , honorary chair of Jamestown 2007, and other dignitaries at the rededication of Historic Jamestowne. He was expected to help officially ring in the weekend with a ceremony at Anniversary Park later Friday. On Saturday, a replica of the small work boat that colonist John Smith used to explore the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in the early 17th Century will set sail to retrace Smith's voyage. Other highlights include a joint performance by the Virginia Symphony and Richmond Symphony orchestras to premiere works written for the commemoration and a concert headlined by Bruce Hornsby, the Williamsburg-based pianist and songwriter. Bush will participate in ceremonies on Sunday, and the weekend will conclude with the performance of a 400-piece orchestra and a 1,607-voice choir. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/virginia_tech_graduation	Va. Tech graduations honor slain victims - Yahoo! News Va. Tech graduations honor slain victims By KRISTEN GELINEAU, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 9 minutes ago BLACKSBURG, Va. - Thousands of Virginia Tech graduates struggled to balance joy with grief as commencement ceremonies got under way Friday, less than a month after a student gunman's rampage devastated the campus. In an address to about 600 of the nearly 1,200 graduate students who received master's degrees, President Charles Steger spoke to the community's grief while encouraging the graduates to be proud of their accomplishments and hopeful for their futures. "Our hearts are saddened and our minds are troubled," Steger said. A larger ceremony for some 3,600 graduating seniors was set for Friday evening, where the school planned to issue class rings to relatives of the 26 slain students, followed by diplomas in smaller ceremonies Saturday. "Short was their stay on this mortal stage. Great was their impact," Steger said of the slain students. Gunman Seung-Hui Cho also killed five faculty members and himself. His family will not receive a ring or diploma. During the graduate ceremonies, nine slain graduate students were awarded posthumous master's degrees or doctorates. Faculty members hugged the relatives who received them, some wiping away tears and all drawing long and loud applause from the crowd of several thousand. Graduate Scott Cassell, 55, of Roanoke, hadn't planned to attend the commencement ceremonies. But after the attacks, the father of five decided he would go as a show of support for the grieving families. "I just can't fathom the loss," said Cassell, who received a master's degree in information technology. Security employees checked the bags of guests, armed police officers patrolled the grounds and state troopers stood guard at every entrance. Guests did not have to pass through metal detectors, though, and school officials said the level of security was comparable to what they would see at a home football game. James Long, whose sister, Michelle, earned a degree in history, said students would not let the tragedy overshadow their celebration. "There are too many people here to celebrate five, six years of hard work to let one guy screw that up," said Long, 25, of Richmond. Some families couldn't bear to attend graduation. Others said they had no choice but to come. "We have to. This is right for us," said Peter Read, whose freshman daughter Mary Karen Read was among those killed. Peter and Cathy Read returned to campus for more than their daughter's degree. They also returned to erase an unsettling image from the minds of their two youngest sons, Patrick, 4, and Brendan, 2. "They're a little concerned that the bad man's going to shoot them," Cathy Read said. "We can't let that idea grow in their heads." issued a statement praising "the compassion and resilient spirit" of the Virginia Tech community and the 3,600 graduating seniors and others earning advanced or associate degrees. "Laura and I salute the Virginia Tech Class of 2007. We also remember the students and teachers whose lives were taken last month," he said. "They will always hold a special place in the hearts of this graduating class and an entire nation." Twins Andrea and Michelle Falletti of Chantilly, Va., said the shootings will not be what they remember when they look back on four years of college. Rather, they will recall spring breaks, camping trips and partying with friends. "Obviously, what has happened has affected everything in our lives, and it will affect graduation," said Andrea Falletti, 21. "In a way, it's not going to be celebrating us as much; it's more about what we've done as a community. But that's OK. I'm proud of what we've done here."

News Murder verdict upheld despite DNA trick Thu May 10, 11:51 PM ET OLYMPIA, Wash. - Police didn't violate any privacy laws when they posed as lawyers to get a man's DNA sample from an envelope he licked, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday, upholding the man's murder conviction. John Athan was sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for the 2004 Seattle killing of a 13-year-old girl in 1982, when Athan was 14. Police suspected him at the time but lacked the evidence to arrest him, and the case went unsolved for two decades. In 2003, police sent Athan a letter on the stationery of a fictitious law firm, asking if they could represent him in a class-action lawsuit. Athan, of Palisades Park, N.J., licked the envelope and returned it, providing the DNA sample investigators needed to link him to semen found on the girl's body. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the ruse violated his privacy rights. The court's 6-3 ruling found no privacy interest in the saliva used to seal a person's mail. But even though posing as a lawyer is a misdemeanor under state law, the trick "was not so outrageous or shocking as to warrant dismissing the case," Justice Charles Johnson wrote for the majority. The Washington State Bar Association had argued that letting police pose as lawyers was unnecessary and could chill relationships between attorneys and clients, and dissenting justices agreed. Dissenters and one member of the majority also worried that the ruling did not give strong enough privacy protections to a person's DNA. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Man guilty in Chicago restaurant murders By KAREN HAWKINS, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 11:26 PM ET CHICAGO - A man was found guilty Thursday in the execution-style murders of seven people at a Chicago restaurant 14 years ago in what authorities say was a robbery that netted less than $2,000. Jurors deliberated for about eight hours before delivering the verdict against Juan Luna on all seven counts of first-degree murder. The same jurors will reconvene on Monday for the death penalty phase of case. "Today the agonizing wait is over," said Wisconsin state Rep. Jennifer Shilling, whose parents owned the Brown's Chicken and Pasta in Palatine and were among those killed. "We as family can finally exhale from this long and emotional nightmare." Victims' families began sobbing in the minutes before the verdict was read and their crying intensified when it was finally announced in court. Another man, Luna's high school friend James Degorski, has pleaded not guilty to the murders and will be tried separately. The evidence against Luna included DNA recovered from a chicken dinner the night of the slayings and a videotaped confession from the 33-year-old appliance installer. Defense attorneys attacked the reliability of that evidence during the trial and again at closing arguments, saying the DNA might not be Luna's and that, even if it was, it doesn't prove he committed the crime. Luna was 18 when prosecutors said he and Degorski walked into the restaurant on Jan. 8, 1993, at closing time and carried out the killings. The bodies of the restaurant owners Richard and Lynn Ehlenfeldt and five employees were found in a walk-in cooler and freezer. Luna was arrested nearly five years ago and is now a married father of a young son. Jurors had grisly evidence to review, including horrific crime scene photos and chilling descriptions of how the victims were systematically executed. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Engineer guilty in military secrets case By GILLIAN FLACCUS, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 7:24 AM ET SANTA ANA, Calif. - After a six-week trial, a federal jury convicted a Chinese-born engineer of conspiring to export U.S. defense technology to China, including data on an electronic propulsion system that could make submarines virtually undetectable. Friends and colleagues knew Chi Mak as an unassuming, brilliant man who worked 12-hour days as an engineer for a defense contractor, rarely went out and scrimped to pay off his 700-square-foot suburban home. Federal prosecutors portrayed Mak as a polished agent for the Chinese who used his low-key lifestyle and good reputation as a cover for his real work &#151; conspiring to pass U.S. secrets for more than two decades. The jury sided with the government, also finding Mak guilty of acting as an unregistered foreign agent, attempting to violate export control laws and making false statements to the Prosecutors had dropped a charge of the actual export of defense articles. Mak stared straight ahead and seemed to hold back tears as the verdict was read. One of his attorneys gently rubbed his back. Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Staples said Mak faces up to 45 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 10. "We were confident from the start and we're very happy with the verdict," Staples said. The government accused Mak, a naturalized U.S. citizen, of taking thousands of pages of documents from his defense contractor employer, Power Paragon of Anaheim, and giving them to his brother, who passed them along to Chinese authorities over a number of years. Mak was arrested in 2005 in Los Angeles after FBI agents stopped his brother and sister-in-law as they boarded a flight to Hong Kong. Investigators said they found three encrypted CDs in their luggage that contained documents on a submarine propulsion system, a solid-state power switch for ships and a Power Point presentation on the future of power electronics. Mak acknowledged during the trial that he copied classified documents from his employer and kept copies in his office. He maintained he didn't realize that making the copies was illegal. Chi Mak's wife, brother and other relatives also have been indicted and go on trial together on June 5. Staples said the government may use the verdict to try to negotiate plea bargains with Mak's indicted family members, who pleaded not guilty. Defense attorneys Marilyn Bednarski and Ronald Kaye said they would appeal the verdict, insisting the government had manipulated the facts. In many instances, the government was allowed to present classified information to U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney in his chambers, and the defense team was not allowed to view the government's application for a warrant to bug Mak's house and car, Kaye said. "It is so absurd to believe that he has been passing technology for 20 years when they had not one witness and not one piece of paper to corroborate this," Kaye said. The trial featured testimony from FBI agents, officials, encryption and espionage experts and the engineer himself. Key to the trial was the government's allegation that Mak confessed to the conspiracy &#151; and even named his so-called "handler" and specific restricted documents &#151; during an untaped jailhouse interview two days after his arrest. Mak testified he never confessed during that interview, but admitted on cross-examination that he lied repeatedly in an earlier taped interview about the number of times he had visited China and when he told authorities he didn't have friends or relatives there. He said he felt intimidated during the interrogation. "This is why I lied," he said. "They were pushing me that night." Mak's attorneys focused on a paper he had written on the propulsion system that was found in his brother's luggage at Los Angeles International Airport. Mak said he believed he was doing nothing wrong by giving the paper to his brother to take out of the country because he had written it for Power Paragon and had presented it at an engineering conference in 2004. The government, however, alleged the documents were export-controlled and couldn't fall into foreigners' hands.

News Police: S.C. family held in squalor By SEANNA ADCOX, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 44 minutes ago CHESTER, S.C. - For nearly four years, a South Carolina man held his wife and two sons captive in a house infested with maggots and human waste, authorities said. The boys slept on a bare mattress as their mother was kept in a drug-induced stupor in a house that was decrepit except for a tidy one-room illegal gambling parlor run by Danny William Dove, police said. Police found maggots infesting the refrigerator. Human waste and used toilet paper littered the bathroom floor and the house smelled like a dead animal, according to police photographs and authorities who visited the home after Dove was arrested this week. The living room was covered in trash and upturned furniture, the kitchen's cabinets were falling apart and dirty clothing was piled in waist-high heaps. "There was chaos everywhere," Chester County Sheriff's Detective Scott Thompson said Thursday. "I don't think we'll ever really determine how it happened &#151; how you get to live like that. I think he got so wrapped up in drugs and wanting to control everything, nothing else mattered." The young boys, ages 4 and 8, didn't go to school. Police say they rarely were allowed out of the house and that a video camera monitored their room and the doors to the home. The boys' own grandmother says they're hard to understand unless they're cursing. Dove, 45, plied his wife, Tamara, with prescription painkillers, cocaine and crack, and forbade her to go outside, police said. Thompson said he didn't expect the 37-year-old mother would be lucid enough to be interviewed for weeks. "People don't understand why she just doesn't leave," Thompson said. "But with a little intimidation and a lot of drug use, this is what they grew to know as normal life." Dove was charged with two counts of distribution of a controlled substance, two counts of criminal conspiracy, operating a gambling establishment and two counts of child neglect. He remained in jail Thursday without bond. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison. But Dove's mother said her son held no one hostage and that his wife was the root of the couple's drug addiction. "She's driven my son crazy," Helaine Young said in an interview at her home. Young said she threw up when she visited the home with police, her first visit since Christmas 2005, when she said she left after being threatened by her daughter-in-law. Young said her son was once a wealthy owner of several convenience stores, paying for anything his wife requested including baby sitters and house cleaners. Her son installed the cameras for the family's security when he renovated the home in a rural town near the North Carolina line, she said. The pair met about 13 years ago, Young said. Young, who has taken care of the couple's 12-year-old son since he was an infant, said she's asked the Department of Social Services repeatedly over the last six years to investigate. "We have had reports in the past, and the nature of the reports are currently under review," agency spokeswoman Marilyn Matheus said. "It's too early to tell what exactly happened when." Dove's oldest child, 20-year-old Brittney Dove, said she and a friend used to take care of the boys when she stayed in the home. But she last saw them about three years ago, she said. "She would not get out of the bed," Brittney said of the boys' mother. "It disgusts me that he's in jail. I'm not condoning what he did. There's no excuse for the child neglect. But she should be there, too. He honestly loved her. He was nothing but good to her." Thompson said the boys were socially inept. "The oldest one can communicate, but it's on a 3- to 4-year-old, broken-English level," he said. "The 4-year-old jibber jabbers. It's rambling stuff." Young said the two knew how to curse because that's what they heard at home. "The cuss words were the plainest words you can hear from them," she said, recalling phone conversations with the boys. The boys are living safely with a relative, Thompson said. "Maybe now we've given these kids the chance of a normal life," Thompson said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Men apologize for Boston cartoon stunt By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:28 PM ET BOSTON - Prosecutors said they would not pursue charges against two men who planted electronic devices around the city as part of a botched advertising campaign after the pair apologized Friday for causing a bomb scare. Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28, also performed community service at a rehabilitation center in a deal with prosecutors. In contrast to their first court appearance in January, when they mugged for the camera and waved to friends in the courtroom, the men offered contrite apologies and said they never expected the stunt to cause any turmoil. "I deeply regret that this incident caused such anguish and disruption to so many people," Berdovsky told the Charlestown District Court. Stevens said he saw the devices simply as "harmless entertainment." "I had no intention of upsetting or alarming anyone," he said. The two were accused of planting about three dozen battery-powered devices in Boston and Cambridge on Jan. 31. The devices, a promotion for Cartoon Network, had lights that created images of a cartoon character making an obscene gesture. Fears of terrorism arose when the devices were discovered in a subway station and on a bridge, among other locations. Bomb squads were deployed, and highways, bridges and some transit stations were temporarily closed. Similar signs were placed in nine other cities around the United States, but only in Boston did they elicit such a response. Berdovsky and Stevens were charged with placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct. Attorney General Martha Coakley said it would have been difficult to prove to a jury that the men intended to create panic, and that she did not believe they realized the problems the ads would cause. "We believe this was an appropriate and fair resolution," Coakley said. Berdovsky said he was relieved the case was resolved without a trial. "I am looking forward to what the future has to bring. I'm just going to be working really hard and working on my art and working to build a really peaceful community for all of us to live in," Berdovsky told The Associated Press by telephone after the hearing. Berdovsky performed 80 hours of service and Stevens completed 60 hours at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston. The men designed a cartoon mural that will be painted in a waiting area for children undergoing physical therapy, said Oz Mondejar, Spaulding's vice president of human resources. They also helped patients use computers, cleaned the hospital's sailing docks and helped produce a DVD featuring patients talking about their rehabilitation successes. Turner Broadcasting and the advertising agency that carried out the campaign, Interference Inc., agreed to pay a $2 million settlement to cover costs and restitution for the law enforcement response. The head of the Cartoon Network resigned nine days after the stunt. Full Coverage: Media Issues Coulter cleared in Florida vote probe AP via Yahoo! News, May 11 Calif.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/fort_dix_plot	Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail - Yahoo! News Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail By GEOFF MULVIHILL, Associated press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET CAMDEN, N.J. - Six Muslim men suspected of plotting to massacre U.S. soldiers at Fort Dix were ordered held without bail Friday. Prosecutors argued that the men, all born outside the United States, pose a flight risk. They are being held at a federal detention center in Philadelphia. The men were arrested Monday during what the said was an attempt to buy AK-47 machine guns, M-16s and other weapons. They targeted Fort Dix, a post 25 miles east of Philadelphia that is used primarily to train reservists, partly because one of them had delivered pizzas there and was familiar with the base, according to court filings. Their objective was to kill "as many American soldiers as possible," the documents said. The men have lived in and around Philadelphia for years, worshipped at moderate mosques and worked blue-collar jobs installing roofs, driving a cab, delivering pizzas and baking bread. Four are ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia, one is from Jordan and one is from Turkey. As they were led into the courtroom, each of the suspects smiled to relatives and friends, many of whom wept and blew kisses to them. Only one of the men, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, 22, asked to be released on bail, and friends and relatives offered to post properties they owned as collateral. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Stigall argued against letting Shnewer be released to the custody of his parents while awaiting trial. He said many of the illegal actions that the government alleges Shnewer committed happened or were planned at his parents' house. Defense lawyers for some of the men said they are considering attacking the prosecution's reliance on two paid informants who infiltrated the group more than a year ago and recorded conversations with the defendants. Authorities said they first learned about the men in January 2006 after a tip from a clerk at a Mount Laurel electronics store. Circuit City spokeswoman Jackie Foreman said Friday that credit for the tip is shared by two employees. She declined to name them but said the company has "communicated its appreciation." She declined to give details. The pair called police because a home video the men wanted transferred to a DVD looked like it might have terrorist links, U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie said. Earlier this year, authorities said, the men took a training trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where they fired weapons and played paintball to prepare for an attack. Five of the men &#151; Shnewer; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan "Anthony" or "Tony" Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir "Elvis" Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. Abdullahu, who faces the least serious charges of the six, will have another bail hearing next Thursday.

News XM shock jocks apologize for sex comment 2 hours, 27 minutes ago WASHINGTON - XM Satellite Radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony apologized Friday for airing a homeless man's crude comments that he'd like to have sex with The remarks were made on their show Wednesday by a guest the duo call Homeless Charlie. As the name of each woman came up, the guest said he would like to have sex with her &#151; using language not fit for print. Opie and Anthony laughed as they imagined Rice's "horror" while describing a violent sexual encounter in which Rice is punched in the face. Washington-based XM condemned the remarks. "We deplore the comments made on Wednesday's 'Opie & Anthony Show,'" XM spokesman Nathaniel Brown told The Associated Press on Friday. He would not say whether XM planned to take disciplinary action. Opie and Anthony, whose full names are Anthony Cumia and Greg "Opie" Hughes, apologized to listeners on Friday's show. "We apologize to the public officials for comments that we made on our XM show on May 9th. We take very seriously the responsibility that comes with our creative freedom and regret any offense that this segment has caused," they said. Because the show airs on satellite radio, there are no federal restrictions on its content. According to XM's Web site, the radio service has parental controls that allow users to block access to channels that frequently contain explicit language. Those channels are designated with an "XL" notation. The same radio duo was dumped by CBS Radio in August 2002 for running a contest in which they said two listeners had sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. They were hired by XM in 2004. The remarks could become an issue as XM seeks approval from the to merge with New York-based Sirius Satellite Radio, said Tom Taylor, editor of the trade magazine Inside Radio. "XM and Sirius don't want any regulation," he said in Friday's New York Daily News. "But it's come up in four congressional hearings &#151; and at this point, the merger is such a close call, any issue could become important." The FCC did not return phone calls Friday seeking comment. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News 3 dead in crash on Chesapeake Bay bridge By BRIAN WITTE, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 9:44 AM ET ANNAPOLIS, Md. - A runaway trailer started a chain-reaction crash on the Chesapeake Bay bridge, killing three people and injuring five others as dozens of vehicles swerved to avoid it, authorities said. As crumpled trucks were hauled away Thursday evening, structural engineers examined the bridge by boat, air and foot and it was found to be structurally sound and safe, said Marcus Brown, chief of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police. Friday morning, all lanes were open again. The bridge, officially known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, is the main artery connecting Maryland's Eastern Shore with the rest of the state. With the westbound lanes closed all night, stores on the eastern side were busy. "They can't get across the bridge to go home so they're just hanging out until the bridge opens up. It's good for business, but it's not good for me here all alone," said Melodie Shreve, who was working by herself at the Shore Stop in Stevensville. The Best Western in Grasonville, a few miles from the bridge, sold out by 8 p.m. Melissa Hess, the front desk supervisor, said some guests who had suites even gave up their second room to help stranded motorists. The crash started when a small flatbed trailer being pulled by an SUV came unattached shortly after 4 p.m. at the start of the bridge's westbound span. In all, seven vehicles crashed, including a tanker hauling animal fat and a tow truck. "Other vehicles that were following swerved to avoid a trailer and that's what started this collision," said police Cpl. Jonathan Green. He described it as an "unbelievable crash scene" with vehicles pinned against each other and the railings, but said none went off the bridge. Brown said it was too early in the investigation to say whether charges would be filed. One person was flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center with life-threatening injuries; four others had less serious injuries, Brown said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News More Mo. flooding; parts of river crest By CHRIS BLANK, Associated Press Writer WOOLDRIDGE, Mo. - Levee breaks along the Missouri River flooded homes, farms, highways and railroad tracks as floodwaters that have inundated the region were expected to peak in some spots this weekend. Near-record flood levels dropped in some places but rose in northwest and central Missouri, as worried residents removed valuables from their homes and filled sandbags to protect river communities. A barge that floated loose in Glasgow was captured by the state water patrol about 60 road miles downstream near Hartsburg, officials said. The water patrol planned to tie it up until the waters recede, Highway Patrol Capt. Tim Hull said. Along the Mississippi River, surging water and debris threatened to knock loose a docked, four-story pleasure barge and slam it into a bridge. Three of the four chains holding it in place broke, but crews and a private tug boat company were able to secure it. Inmates from St. Joseph prison and National Guard members filled sandbags to try to protect a water treatment plant, schools and an ethanol plant near Craig, where the Missouri River dropped a few inches Thursday. The water got within "a hillbilly's whisker from going over in several places," Holt County Sheriff Kirby Felumb said. Rivers breached or topped dozens of levees across the state, officials said. No serious injuries or deaths had been reported in the flooding, said Brian Hauswirth, a spokesman for the State Emergency Management Agency. The storms that raised river levels also generated the tornadoes that killed 12 people in Kansas last weekend. Although the river crests were lower than forecast in many areas, residents remained anxious. Many were here for the 1993 floods, among the most costly in U.S. history. At the State Emergency Operations Center, Gov. Matt Blunt said damage assessment teams were being dispatched to 17 counties, and about 100 Missouri National Guard members had been deployed. He said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has prepared about 1.2 million sandbags. "We were fortunate that a majority of counties made a lot of improvements since '93," National Guard Col. Glenn Hagler said. The rain-swollen rivers and streams that make up the Missouri River system are causing damage as the water flows east toward St. Louis, where the Missouri River meets the Mississippi, said Suzanne Fortin, a meteorologist with the In Jefferson City, the Missouri River was expected to crest Sunday at 8.7 feet above flood stage, which could cause flooding at the airport and other low-lying areas below the bluff where the state Capitol sits. Officials in Chariton County, which includes Brunswick, said the Grand River was expected to crest Friday afternoon and the levees should hold. People were sandbagging some low-lying spots. Some basements had water in them, but no serious damage or injuries were reported. Also Friday, farmers in Wooldridge, a tiny town about 15 miles west of Columbia, contested plans by the Department of Conversation to let a small amount of water into a wetland habitat. Levees had cut the area off from the Missouri River, said wildlife regional supervisor Mike Schroer. But town residents objected and stopped water from entering the pipe about 15 minutes after it was opened, and the agency said it had no plans to try again. John Clay, whose farm is protected by the levee, said two area residents were standing guard to prevent state officials from reopening it. "This could not be acceptable, and there can be no good reason to do this at this point in time with the river flooding," he said.

Calif. island fire turned from town By ANDREW GLAZER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET AVALON, Calif. - Firefighters turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and some residents planned to return to their homes Friday after thousands were forced to evacuate a day earlier. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of dozens of fire trucks and air tankers on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. "Everyone is working very hard to make sure that the people are safe and the animals are safe," Gov. Most of the 76-square-mile island is owned by a land conservancy, home to wildlife including the Catalina Island fox, North American bison and bald eagle. Flames that had menaced the main city of Avalon the night before were no longer visible from there on Friday. But a layer of ash and a puff of smoke that rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon in the island's rugged interior, feeding on dry brush and fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small structures in the canyons outside the city burned. About 3,800 residents and tourists fled, Schwarzenegger said. As people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland, many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Anita Bussing, a therapist who has a second home on the island, described a sky "completely gray with orange streaks." The helicopters were flying all over the place," she said. "People were freaking out, children were crying." Island hotel worker Susana Garcia, 22, waited long into the night at the dock looking for her father. She had gone to the mainland to do errands before the fire started and was unable to reach her father, who had stayed behind. "I've been asking everybody if they've seen him, but I haven't found him yet," Garcia said. Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. One firefighter was overcome by inhalation and was in stable condition. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday calmed and were expected to blow the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Television actor Steven W. Bailey, who lives near the park, had gone to Catalina with his wife to escape the smoke and heat on Thursday. As they approached the island, he spotted the smoke of the island blaze, and when they arrived, they weren't allowed to check into their hotel. "It just descended into more and more fire, more and more smoke, more and more ash," Bailey told KABC-TV. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of the Griffith Park fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 &#151; the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away. Associated Press writers Daisy Nguyen and Christina Almeida in Los Angeles, and Gillian Flaccus in Long Beach contributed to this report.

Modified to have a attribute for better module consistency. to allow specifying categorization scheme. for a human readable label. element for media binary hashing. to distinguish formatting of text. Improved descriptions of various elements and attributes. 08/22/2005 - Improved global syndication capabilities: [1.1.0] attributes to media:text and media:content. to give more flexibility to represent things other than people or companies. to explicitly determine what type of media is expressed.

Add time code information to 10/22/2005 - Minor improvements: [1.1.1] Added capability for elements to appear at the to allow explicit global relationships to be expressed. The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of samples per second taken to create the media object. It is expressed in thousands of samples per second (kHz). It is an optional attribute. is number of audio channels in the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of seconds the media object plays. It is an optional attribute. is the height of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared. If this element is not included, it assumes that no restrictions are necessary. It has one optional attribute. r (cz 1 lz 1 nz 1 oz 1 vz 1) is the URI that identifies the rating scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is urn:simple (adult | nonadult). The title of the particular media object. It has 1 optional attribute.

The keywords and phrases should be comma delimited. kitty, cat, big dog, yarn, fluffy Allows particular images to be used as representative images for the media object. If multiple thumbnails are included, and time coding is not at play, it is assumed that the images are in order of importance. It has 1 required attribute and 3 optional attributes. specifies the url of the thumbnail. It is a required attribute. specifies the height of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the width of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the time offset in relation to the media object. Typically this is used when creating multiple keyframes within a single video. The format for this attribute should be in the DSM-CC's Normal Play Time (NTP) as used in RTSP [ RFC 2326 3.6 Normal Play Time ]. It is an optional attribute. NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use.

It has 2 optional attributes. role specifies the role the entity played. Must be lowercase. It is an optional attribute. is the URI that identifies the role scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is 'urn:ebu'.

It has 1 optional attribute. is the url for a terms of use page or additional copyright information. If the media is operating under a Creative Commons license, the Creative Commons module should be used instead. It is an optional attribute. Allows the inclusion of a text transcript, closed captioning, or lyrics of the media content. Many of these elements are permitted to provide a time series of text. In such cases, it is encouraged, but not required, that the elements be grouped by language and appear in time sequence order based on the time. Elements can have overlapping times. It has 4 optional attributes. Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module. A movie review with a trailer, using a Creative Commons license. My Movie Review Site Movie Title: Is this a good movie? A music video with a link to a player window, and additional metadata about the video, including expiration date.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/journalists_subpoenas	Fla. judge tosses reporter subpoenas - Yahoo! News Fla. judge tosses reporter subpoenas By CURT ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 2:14 PM ET MIAMI - A judge on Friday rejected a request from a death row inmate's attorneys to force testimony and get notes from four journalists who covered a botched execution late last year. Circuit Judge Carven Angel ruled that the attorneys for death row inmate Ian Deco Lightbourne must first seek information from some of the 19 other people who witnessed the execution of Angel Diaz, whose death took 34 minutes &#151; twice as long as normal. Lightbourne's attorneys are challenging the state's use of lethal injection as unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment. They subpoenaed the four reporters, including one from The Associated Press, to appear at hearings later this month. The reporters' news organizations asked the judge to block the subpoenas, arguing that Florida law provides a "qualified privilege" protecting journalists from disclosing newsgathering information unless it cannot be obtained another way and is of "compelling interest." "The judge followed the law," said Alison Steele, attorney for the St. Petersburg Times. "Out of this great number of people, I'm sure the defendant's lawyers will find someone who can talk." Attorneys for Lightbourne had subpoenaed Ron Word, the AP's correspondent in Jacksonville, who has covered about 50 executions. Other subpoenas were issued for Chris Tisch of the St. Petersburg Times; Phil Long of The Miami Herald; and Nathan Crabbe of The Gainesville Sun. It remains possible that Lightbourne's lawyers could subpoena the reporters again if they cannot get the necessary testimony from others about the Dec. 13 execution. Diaz's slower than normal death and need for a rare second dose of chemicals led to an investigation and a temporary suspension of executions in Florida. State officials said this week that executions are likely to resume at the end of the month. Lightbourne, 47, was sentenced to death for the 1981 murder of Nancy O'Farrell after breaking into her Marion County home. He has twice been scheduled for execution but won stays to consider his appeals, including one pending before the Florida Supreme Court.

News Md. school evacuated over odd bottle By BEN GREENE, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 16 minutes ago TIMONIUM, Md. - A high school was evacuated Friday after firefighters found a bottle containing a suspicious liquid in a classroom, and a teacher was taken to a hospital for dizziness. A student was arrested hours later. Police aren't releasing the 18-year-old man's name until formal charges are drawn up, Baltimore County police spokesman Bill Toohey said. The bottle found in a trash can smelled like chlorine but the investigation was still continuing into whether it was intended to be an incendiary device, Toohey said. "It was a bottle that contained a toxic substance," Toohey said. Police said the affected area involved a chemistry lab, a bathroom and a hallway at Dulaney High School in a suburb of Baltimore. The ill teacher was taken to a local hospital, Sgt. John Young of the Baltimore County Police Department said. No other injuries were reported. The fire department's hazardous materials team and members of the county police bomb squad were on the scene as a precaution, Jones said. The incident was reported just before 8 a.m., Young said. The school's 1,850 students were allowed to return to the building around 11 a.m. Full Coverage: School Violence Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/cringe_readings	Diary readings: teen angst flashback - Yahoo! News Diary readings: teen angst flashback By SAMANTHA GROSS, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:18 PM ET NEW YORK - The year was 1987, the boy's name was Rob, and 13-year-old Ingrid Wiese had some pressing concerns. "He kisses weird," she wrote in her diary. "I just hope it doesn't stick and I don't end up kissing like that forever." Twenty years later, Wiese hauled the diary out of storage and read it to a bar full of strangers just for laughs. "Cringe" readings, these exercises are called, and they are growing in popularity around the country. In other cities, they have names such as "Mortified" and "Salon of Shame." Groups in New York and elsewhere convene to relive what most would rather forget: the depths of their teenage angst. Participants get up on stage with their ragged, old diaries and are instructed to read only material embarrassing enough to make them cringe. It turns out that embarrassing is also funny. When Wiese appeared at the reading, held monthly at a Brooklyn bar, the room was packed beyond capacity. The 33-year-old fundraiser may have been cringing, but her audience was cheering. "When most people hear about it they think, `Oh God, that would be just absolutely humiliating, I would never do that,'" said Blaise Kearsley, another reader. "But I think there's something so universal about your adolescent diaries and your poems and your school assignments. It's just stuff that everyone can relate to." Indeed, as readers spoke about zits and boys, sex and death, they heard plenty of knowing laughter. Perhaps only teenagers or former teenagers could follow this diary entry, written by a 14-year-old Kearsley in 1987: "When we got to the dance, Erin was depressed because she likes John and he spent the whole night dancing with Ada. But Ada was upset because at the end of the dance John frenched her. And number one: she likes him but she doesn't know if she likes him in THAT WAY. And number two: John is good friends with Dan, her ex, and she knows that Dan will have something to say to John about this." The Brooklyn event was started by a local administrative assistant, Sarah Brown, who in a momentary, drunken lapse started reading her old diaries to friends &#151; and discovered they had finally become more funny than painful. The monthly cringe reading has since landed Brown a book deal and a pilot for cable television's TLC, allowing the 29-year-old to quit her day job. Similar events are happening around the country in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Milwaukee and Seattle. "When you're a teenager, everything is the same level of intensity," Brown said. "They read about boys, or girls, or their parents, or their friends, or school, or something serious like, you know, a divorce &#151; but ... there's no change of tone." While the readers try to keep it light, plenty of the material in their diaries is dark, heart-wrenching stuff. "Why? Why do you think someone could really love you?" a now-grown Ingrid Wiese reads to the crowd. "You're fat, out of shape, covered with zits. You can just feel how your body is GOING. Your arms, your wrists, your calves. You're insecure, immature, and" &#151; she lowers her voice to a whisper &#151; "your grades reflect your intelligence." The 33-year-old Wiese says it's enough to make her wish she could somehow give that insecure girl a hug. "I just want to go back and tell that kid so many things, but mostly that `you're just all right the way you are,'" Wiese said after the reading. These days, Wiese's emotions are less heightened, and she carries herself confidently as she walks from the stage. Still, some things never change. "Of course!" she says when asked if she still obsesses over boys. "And I write all about it on my blog." Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Texas mother accused of mutilating baby By JUAN A. LOZANO, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 16 minutes ago HOUSTON - A mother who claimed the family dog tore off her baby son's genitals was arrested Friday and accused of mutilating the boy herself with a sharp instrument. Katherine Nadal, 25, was led away in handcuffs while awaiting a court hearing on custody of the 3-month-old boy, Holden Gothia. She was charged with injury to a child and held on $100,000 bail. Child-welfare authorities said she told social workers she woke up from a nap March 13 to find that her small dachshund had attacked her son. But a veterinarian and a doctor agreed the dog did not cause the injuries, because there was no blood or human tissue on the animal or in its mouth, police said. Police said in court papers that the mother had used a sharp instrument to cut off the boy's genitals. The instrument was not identified. Nadal's attorney had no comment. Nadal had a history of prescription drug abuse and tested positive for cocaine and methadone the day after Holden was mutilated, authorities said. She has been forbidden to see her son since the injuries occurred in March. "Given what we know today, we will probably work toward terminating her parental rights and reuniting the child with his father or another relative," said Harris County Child Protective Services spokeswoman Estella Olguin. The baby has years of reconstructive surgery and other operations ahead of him, said Daniel Sanders, an attorney for Camden Gothia, the baby's father. The dog has since been released by authorities and adopted. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News 2 detained in Las Vegas bombing By KEN RITTER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 2:31 PM ET LAS VEGAS - Two people were being held in connection with a deadly bombing at a Las Vegas Strip parking lot, police said Friday. One man was questioned as a "person of interest" after being detained on false identification charges, and his home was searched for clues in the bombing that killed an immigrant worker at a hot dog stand on Monday, police said. The homemade bomb had been left on the victim's car at Luxor hotel-casino's parking garage and went off after he picked it up. Police said a second person also was taken into custody but released no further information. The identity of the man who was detained was not made public after he was taken into custody Thursday evening. Police searched the man's home late Thursday "looking for anything tied to the case, including components that could be used to make an explosive device or any items that could tie him or others to the Luxor homicide," Cassell said. Police would not say what led them to the man. "He was detained for questioning," Cassell said. "He will be arrested on the warrants." The development came hours after police released blurry freeze-frame images of a car and appealed for public help to find it and the person who placed the deadly bomb. Police Lt. Lewis Roberts said Thursday that police were still trying to determine a motive for the explosion that mortally wounded 24-year-old Willebaldo Dorantes Antonio. Dorantes Antonio died at a hospital about two hours later of a head injury. A woman who was with Dorantes Antonio escaped injury. Police have said Dorantes Antonio was the intended target and the bombing was not a terrorist act or a mob hit. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the motion-activated bomb blew up with the force of a stick of dynamite. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/maine_somalis	Somalis settle in old mill city in Maine - Yahoo! News Somalis settle in old mill city in Maine By JERRY HARKAVY, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 1:58 PM ET LEWISTON, Maine - A prank in which a middle-schooler tossed a slab of leftover Easter ham onto a table surrounded by Somalian Muslim youngsters has exposed &#151; yet again &#151; the gaping cultural divide in this struggling former mill town. Over the past six years, as many as 3,500 black refugees from the war-torn African country have settled in this nearly all-white, heavily French-Canadian and largely Roman Catholic city of 36,000, giving Lewiston the highest concentration of Somalis anywhere in America. Along Lisbon Street, the main downtown thoroughfare, the latest newcomers to a city built by waves of immigrants have created a mosque, the Red Sea restaurant and a couple of halal grocery stores as they try to adapt to their strange new world. Women in colorful head scarves or ankle-length hijabs can be seen walking together, not far from the canals, the once-bustling mills and the twin spires of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, built with millhands' dollars. But the influx of Somalis has raised tensions. In 2002, then-Mayor Larry Raymond created a furor when he issued a letter asking Lewiston's Somalis, then numbering about 1,000, to advise their countrymen not to come here because the city's resources were "maxed out." Tensions ran high again last summer when a local man rolled a pig's head into a Somali mosque during evening prayers. (Pork is considered unclean by Muslims.) The perpetrator, who said he did it as a joke, was charged with desecrating a place of worship. He committed suicide after a recent standoff with police. Then on April 11 came the ham incident. The student was suspended and the Maine attorney general looked into whether the prank represented a hate crime. Ultimately, no charges were filed. Haaruan Sheekhey, a 27-year-old Somali who moved to Lewiston from Denver two years ago, said he is ready to try his luck elsewhere. His restaurant failed after it was hit by vandals who scratched a swastika on a window, he said, and employers are reluctant to hire Somalis. "If somebody says, `I'm happy in Lewiston,' they're lying," he said. "We're having a hard time in this city. We're struggling. We're trying so hard to be part of this community, trying so hard to find a job, but nobody gives us a chance." Others, however, say that the Somalis are assimilating well and that a few incidents don't reflect the way the newcomers have been accepted. "Yes, there is some friction every once in a while, but that often gets blown out of proportion," said Pierrot Rugaba, program director for refugee and immigration services of Catholic Charities Maine. "Things have improved, but like everything else it takes time." Many Somalis have moved into the city's housing projects, while others are clustered in the downtown area in aging three- and four-story tenements formerly occupied by French-Canadian immigrants who worked at the textile mills in the city's industrial heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By most accounts, language problems and a lack of job opportunities have proven to be the biggest hurdle to Lewiston's Somalis as they try to move up the economic ladder, leading many to shift their hopes and dreams to the next generation. "Their children are the only assets they have. They left everything else in Somalia," said Said Mohamud, manager of the Mogadishu Store, a grocery. Mohamud, 46, who taught chemistry at a university in the Somalian capital, has a daughter studying at Smith College who plans to go on to medical school and another child studying accounting at Barry University in Florida. His six other children also plan to go to college, he said. The Somalis began arriving in this city in the dead of winter in February 2001, beginning the ethnic transformation of a city that was 97 percent white. Lewiston's Somalis now represent close to 10 percent of the population, with an additional 30 or so arriving each month. Because of the Somalis' large families, the percentage in the schools is even higher. Lewiston's emergence as the city with the nation's largest percentage of Somalis happened largely by chance. Many had been placed in the Atlanta area, where it was assumed a warm climate and a large black population would ease their adjustment to America. But dismay at high crime, drugs and gangs prompted the community to look elsewhere, Mohamud said. The word went out that Maine was a safe place to raise a family. Immigrants had resettled in Portland, 40 miles to the south, but there was a shortage of affordable apartments there. Lewiston had more vacancies because of its population losses. "Lewiston is a small town, with no experiences of having immigrants from Africa, so it was a strange marriage," said Omar Jamal, executive director of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in St. Paul, Minn. Minneapolis has the highest number of Somalis, some 20,000, he said, but Lewiston has the highest concentration. Jimmy Simones, owner of a restaurant near City Hall and grandson of Greek immigrants, said incidents like the pig's head and the ham should not overshadow the way the city has welcomed its latest arrivals from abroad. Overall, he said, the Somalis are winning acceptance. "All newcomers run into these bumps in the road. This is nothing different," he said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/aircraft_crash	2 dead in Ohio aircraft collision - Yahoo! News 2 dead in Ohio aircraft collision 2 hours, 1 minute ago SHARONVILLE, Ohio - Two small aircraft collided Friday over suburban Cincinnati, raining debris onto roads and backyards and killing two people on board, authorities said. The accident evidently involved two planes, the said in a recorded message. The agency initially said one of the aircraft might have been a helicopter. Witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the types of aircraft involved. The FAA had no information about the aircrafts' flight plans or why they were so close together. Blue Ash Airport, a runway used by small planes, is several miles away. No injuries were reported on the ground. Several roads were closed because of the debris. The planes' pilots were not required to file flight plans and apparently were not in contact with air traffic controllers, the FAA said. Resident Joe Muenks said wreckage from one of the planes fell in a yard about three blocks from his house. "It took out about a third of a tree," Muenks said. "The plane nose-dived ... The metal was so crunched together we could just see there was no way anyone who was in there could have survived." What remained of the other plane landed in a street less than a mile away, blocking the two-lane road with some debris ending up in a front yard. The aircraft narrowly missed a busy interstate, coming down on either side of it. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Fewer new 'Katrinas' after hurricane By BEN EVANS, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 37 minutes ago WASHINGTON - As baby names go, Katrina isn't in vogue these days. But she hasn't disappeared either. From its peak in the 1980s &#151; when it regularly ranked among the 100 most popular names that parents chose for their daughters &#151; it had gradually slumped to 247th by 2005, even before Hurricane Katrina smashed the Gulf Coast in late summer of that year. The name's association with the catastrophe has now knocked it out of consideration for most parents, sinking its popularity to the lowest ebb since the 1950s. Only about 850 baby girls in the United States were named Katrina last year, according to new data released Friday by the , dropping it more than 100 slots on the popularity list. At a rank of 382nd, it now sits just below Brenna. Ironically, the two states that suffered most of Katrina's wrath bucked the trend, if only in small numbers. In Louisiana, the number of babies named Katrina jumped from eight in the 12 months before the storm to 15 in the 12 months after, according to state health officials. In Mississippi, seven babies were given the name from 2004 until the storm hit in August 2005, according to state data. The number climbed to 24 from September 2005 through the end of 2006. Overall, the country's most popular names list hasn't changed much since 2005. Emily and Jacob remain atop the list. Emily has been the top girls' name since 1996; Jacob for boys since 1999. The national trend surprised Cleveland Evans, a psychology professor and names expert at Bellevue University in Nebraska. But he said Katrina isn't likely to go extinct. "This is not going to be a name like Adolf that's going to disappear and be unusable ever again," he said, referring to that name's association with Adolf Hitler. Scarlett and Stephen Billis, a Los Angeles-area couple, named their daughter Katrina last May. Scarlett said the couple was reluctant to use the name less than a year after the hurricane, but her husband had always liked it as a variation of Katherine, a family name. Also, their family is Greek and the name is close to the popular Greek name Katerina. "People ask if we named her after the hurricane," Billis said. "We didn't pick it because of that and we were actually hesitant ... but we do joke that our house looks like a hurricane hit." The Social Security Administration's rankings, released each year just before Mother's Day, are based on some 4.2 million card applications from 2006. Social Security began compiling the name lists in 1997.

News Va. marks Jamestown settlement By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 30 minutes ago JAMESTOWN, Va. - History lovers lined up Friday to buy a postage stamp recognizing Jamestown as America's first permanent English settlement, one of several weekend events marking the site's 400th anniversary. The commemoration will also include concerts, fireworks and a Sunday appearance by More than 100 white tents and several stages were set up around the Jamestown venues, giving them the feel of a county fair. Cultural anthropologist Judith Scott, who's been collecting stamps since was 8, waited more than an hour to buy the new Jamestown issue. The 41-cent stamp's triangular shape represents the settlers' original three-sided fort and their three ships. With her purchases tucked inside a commemorative tote bag, she and her husband, Carl, were ready to start hitting the concert stages and exhibition tents. "We don't to miss a thing," said Scott, a Venezuela native who lives in Oakton. Activities were taking place at Historic Jamestowne, where archaeologists in the mid-1990s found the remains of the settlers' fort, which had long been thought to have been washed away in the James River; the Jamestown Settlement museum, which has replicas of the fort, the settlers' three ships and an Indian village; and at the new Anniversary Park, across from Jamestown Settlement. Virginia has been throwing major Jamestown bashes every 50 years, but they have been careful to call this year's event a "commemoration," rather than a celebration. With the arrival of the English in May 1607, native Indian tribes eventually were pushed off their lands, and slavery in America is traced to Jamestown, where the first Africans in the country arrived in 1619. This year's anniversary of the colony, which was founded as a business venture, is the first to focus on all three of those cultures. The 1957 anniversary was a largely white affair. Blacks were involved in the 1907 anniversary exposition, held an hour away in Norfolk, which included a visit by black educator and leader Booker T. Washington on "Negro Day." "In 2007, it's our year to get it right, to make sure everyone is at the table," Gov. Timothy M. Kaine said. More than half of the weekend's 90,000 tickets remained unsold as of last week. Amateur historian James Pegram of Hernando, Fla., said he planned to attend all three days. "I love this place and I think everyone in America should be here at least once," Pegram said. On Friday, Kaine was expected to join former Supreme Court Justice , honorary chair of Jamestown 2007, and other dignitaries at the rededication of Historic Jamestowne. He was expected to help officially ring in the weekend with a ceremony at Anniversary Park later Friday. On Saturday, a replica of the small work boat that colonist John Smith used to explore the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in the early 17th Century will set sail to retrace Smith's voyage. Other highlights include a joint performance by the Virginia Symphony and Richmond Symphony orchestras to premiere works written for the commemoration and a concert headlined by Bruce Hornsby, the Williamsburg-based pianist and songwriter. Bush will participate in ceremonies on Sunday, and the weekend will conclude with the performance of a 400-piece orchestra and a 1,607-voice choir. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/virginia_tech_graduation	Va. Tech graduations honor slain victims - Yahoo! News Va. Tech graduations honor slain victims By KRISTEN GELINEAU, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 13 minutes ago BLACKSBURG, Va. - Thousands of Virginia Tech graduates struggled to balance joy with grief as commencement ceremonies got under way Friday, less than a month after a student gunman's rampage devastated the campus. In an address to about 600 of the nearly 1,200 graduate students who received master's degrees, President Charles Steger spoke to the community's grief while encouraging the graduates to be proud of their accomplishments and hopeful for their futures. "Our hearts are saddened and our minds are troubled," Steger said. A larger ceremony for some 3,600 graduating seniors was set for Friday evening, where the school planned to issue class rings to relatives of the 26 slain students, followed by diplomas in smaller ceremonies Saturday. "Short was their stay on this mortal stage. Great was their impact," Steger said of the slain students. Gunman Seung-Hui Cho also killed five faculty members and himself. His family will not receive a ring or diploma. During the graduate ceremonies, nine slain graduate students were awarded posthumous master's degrees or doctorates. Faculty members hugged the relatives who received them, some wiping away tears and all drawing long and loud applause from the crowd of several thousand. Graduate Scott Cassell, 55, of Roanoke, hadn't planned to attend the commencement ceremonies. But after the attacks, the father of five decided he would go as a show of support for the grieving families. "I just can't fathom the loss," said Cassell, who received a master's degree in information technology. Security employees checked the bags of guests, armed police officers patrolled the grounds and state troopers stood guard at every entrance. Guests did not have to pass through metal detectors, though, and school officials said the level of security was comparable to what they would see at a home football game. James Long, whose sister, Michelle, earned a degree in history, said students would not let the tragedy overshadow their celebration. "There are too many people here to celebrate five, six years of hard work to let one guy screw that up," said Long, 25, of Richmond. Some families couldn't bear to attend graduation. Others said they had no choice but to come. "We have to. This is right for us," said Peter Read, whose freshman daughter Mary Karen Read was among those killed. Peter and Cathy Read returned to campus for more than their daughter's degree. They also returned to erase an unsettling image from the minds of their two youngest sons, Patrick, 4, and Brendan, 2. "They're a little concerned that the bad man's going to shoot them," Cathy Read said. "We can't let that idea grow in their heads." issued a statement praising "the compassion and resilient spirit" of the Virginia Tech community and the 3,600 graduating seniors and others earning advanced or associate degrees. "Laura and I salute the Virginia Tech Class of 2007. We also remember the students and teachers whose lives were taken last month," he said. "They will always hold a special place in the hearts of this graduating class and an entire nation." Twins Andrea and Michelle Falletti of Chantilly, Va., said the shootings will not be what they remember when they look back on four years of college. Rather, they will recall spring breaks, camping trips and partying with friends. "Obviously, what has happened has affected everything in our lives, and it will affect graduation," said Andrea Falletti, 21. "In a way, it's not going to be celebrating us as much; it's more about what we've done as a community. But that's OK. I'm proud of what we've done here." Associated Press writers Sue Lindsey and Vicki Smith contributed to this report. Full Coverage: Virginia Tech Graduation Va.

News Calif. island survives wildfire scare By GILLIAN FLACCUS, Associated Press Writer AVALON, Calif. - Water-dumping planes and helicopters helped beat back soaring flames that threatened this quaint Catalina Island town Friday, giving firefighters a victory that allowed nearly 4,000 evacuated residents to start coming home. Even though the six-square-mile blaze was only 10 percent contained, the wildfire and thick smoke was confined to the tinder-dry brush in the mountains of this narrow island 30 miles off Los Angeles. Avalon's cobblestone streets, brightly painted bungalows, landmark casino and tourist hotels were mostly spared, with only one home and several outbuildings burned. No one was seriously injured. "Thank goodness the firefighters did get here because that made the difference," said Martha Ashleigh, 61, who has lived on Catalina on and off for years. "We were watching from our balcony and we could just see truck after truck go up there. They were just fabulous." A day earlier, flames bore down from the mountains, raining ash and chaos on the crescent harbor. Evacuated residents clambered onto ferries that passed hovercrafts packed with fire trucks from the mainland. Many were workers who cook and clean for vacationers. Others were at vacation homes as the summer tourist season geared up. "It's like a war zone. The skies turned completely gray with orange streaks. The helicopters were flying all over the place," said Anita Bussing, a therapist whose other home is in Long Beach. "People were freaking out, children were crying." By Friday afternoon, one ferry full of residents was headed back to the island on from Long Beach, and a relay of water-carrying helicopters saturated a hillside at the edge of town where smoke curled into the blue sky. The step appeared intended to extinguish any lingering hot spots. The cause of the fire, which erupted Thursday afternoon in the 76-square-mile island's rugged interior, had not yet been determined. The island's relative isolation has proven a liability before. A 1915 fire that started in a hotel burned half the town's buildings. The island's romantic vibe was memorialized in the 1958 hit "26 Miles (Santa Catalina)." Before private jets and third homes became standard fare for the rich and really famous, Santa Catalina was a celebrity haunt for the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Cecil B. DeMille. About 300 movies have been shot on the island or in nearby waters, including "Mutiny on the Bounty," "Chinatown," "Jaws" and "Apollo 13." One relic of that era are the herds of bison that were brought over for filming and later released. Environmentalists said it was too early to tell how the blaze affected the island's overall ecosystem, home to rare animal and plant life, including the Catalina Island fox. But four bald eaglets that hatched earlier this year without human help were unharmed, according to Bob Rhein, a spokesman for the Catalina Island Conservancy which owns most of the island. The eagles were wiped out decades ago by chemical contamination. Just days before and about 50 miles away on the mainland, crews beat back flames in Los Angeles' major park that singed a neighborhood of multimillion-dollar homes. That was the third menacing fire in the Hollywood Hills this spring &#151; and wildfire season here isn't supposed to heat up until the fall. Around the country, firefighters battled a wildfire in Georgia and northern Florida that burned 179,940 acres &#151; or 281 square miles &#151; since a lightning strike ignited it a week ago. The fire, which started last Saturday in the middle of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, took just six days to grow larger than a wildfire that has burned 116,480 acres of Georgia forest and swampland over more than three weeks. In Georgia, the fire posed a potential threat to the tiny city of Fargo, where 380 people live about eight miles west of the Okefenokee Swamp. No evacuations had been ordered Friday. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away. Associated Press writers Jeff Wilson and Robert Jablon in Los Angeles, Peter Prengaman in Long Beach and Andrew Glazer in Avalon contributed to this report.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/military_secrets_china	Engineer guilty in military secrets case - Yahoo! News Engineer guilty in military secrets case By GILLIAN FLACCUS, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 7:24 AM ET SANTA ANA, Calif. - After a six-week trial, a federal jury convicted a Chinese-born engineer of conspiring to export U.S. defense technology to China, including data on an electronic propulsion system that could make submarines virtually undetectable. Friends and colleagues knew Chi Mak as an unassuming, brilliant man who worked 12-hour days as an engineer for a defense contractor, rarely went out and scrimped to pay off his 700-square-foot suburban home. Federal prosecutors portrayed Mak as a polished agent for the Chinese who used his low-key lifestyle and good reputation as a cover for his real work &#151; conspiring to pass U.S. secrets for more than two decades. The jury sided with the government, also finding Mak guilty of acting as an unregistered foreign agent, attempting to violate export control laws and making false statements to the Prosecutors had dropped a charge of the actual export of defense articles. Mak stared straight ahead and seemed to hold back tears as the verdict was read. One of his attorneys gently rubbed his back. Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Staples said Mak faces up to 45 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 10. "We were confident from the start and we're very happy with the verdict," Staples said. The government accused Mak, a naturalized U.S. citizen, of taking thousands of pages of documents from his defense contractor employer, Power Paragon of Anaheim, and giving them to his brother, who passed them along to Chinese authorities over a number of years. Mak was arrested in 2005 in Los Angeles after FBI agents stopped his brother and sister-in-law as they boarded a flight to Hong Kong. Investigators said they found three encrypted CDs in their luggage that contained documents on a submarine propulsion system, a solid-state power switch for ships and a Power Point presentation on the future of power electronics. Mak acknowledged during the trial that he copied classified documents from his employer and kept copies in his office. He maintained he didn't realize that making the copies was illegal. Chi Mak's wife, brother and other relatives also have been indicted and go on trial together on June 5. Staples said the government may use the verdict to try to negotiate plea bargains with Mak's indicted family members, who pleaded not guilty. Defense attorneys Marilyn Bednarski and Ronald Kaye said they would appeal the verdict, insisting the government had manipulated the facts. In many instances, the government was allowed to present classified information to U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney in his chambers, and the defense team was not allowed to view the government's application for a warrant to bug Mak's house and car, Kaye said. "It is so absurd to believe that he has been passing technology for 20 years when they had not one witness and not one piece of paper to corroborate this," Kaye said. The trial featured testimony from FBI agents, officials, encryption and espionage experts and the engineer himself. Key to the trial was the government's allegation that Mak confessed to the conspiracy &#151; and even named his so-called "handler" and specific restricted documents &#151; during an untaped jailhouse interview two days after his arrest. Mak testified he never confessed during that interview, but admitted on cross-examination that he lied repeatedly in an earlier taped interview about the number of times he had visited China and when he told authorities he didn't have friends or relatives there. He said he felt intimidated during the interrogation. "This is why I lied," he said. "They were pushing me that night." Mak's attorneys focused on a paper he had written on the propulsion system that was found in his brother's luggage at Los Angeles International Airport. Mak said he believed he was doing nothing wrong by giving the paper to his brother to take out of the country because he had written it for Power Paragon and had presented it at an engineering conference in 2004. The government, however, alleged the documents were export-controlled and couldn't fall into foreigners' hands.

News Pitcher's estate sued over plane crash By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer NEW YORK - An apartment owner sued the estate of New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle, claiming the player's plane destroyed his home and caused him emotional injuries when it crashed into a high-rise building, killing Lidle and another man. The lawsuit filed Thursday by architect Stephane Sparta says he was at home Oct. 11 when the airplane crashed into the 30th floor of the luxury building on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The wreckage "exploded" into his 31st-floor living room, setting the contents on fire, the lawsuit says. Sparta has moved to another apartment in the building, his lawyer said. "It didn't strike him but it gave him quite a shock," lawyer David C. Cook said. "It came as close to giving him a haircut as you can get." Lidle and flight instructor Tyler Stanger had taken a midday flight past the Statue of Liberty and north up the East River but apparently had trouble as they tried to turn south. National Transportation Safety Board National Transportation Safety Board reached no final conclusions about the cause of the crash, nor whether Lidle or Stanger was piloting the plane at the time. The lawsuit is the third filed by building residents against the Lidle estate. It asks for unspecified money damages and names Lidle's wife, Melanie, as the defendant in her capacity as estate administrator. A lawyer for Melanie Lidle, Robert N. Clarke Jr., did not immediately return a call for comment. In March, Clarke said wrongful-death lawsuits for Lidle and the flight instructor were filed against Cirrus Design Corp., maker of the airplane, alleging product liability, negligence and other complaints.
